In both conditions, compliance with treatment is key to successfully treat these disorders. In the current study, we examine the effect of MDD on the compliance with ADs in patients diagnosed with co-morbid HIV/AIDS and how different classes of ADs influence compliance in this group of patients. Methods: A prospective, cohort study design was used to analyse nationally representative medicine claims data submitted to a privately-owned South African Pharmaceutical Benefit Management (PBM) company. Two groups were distinguished in the database, namely patients with only MDD and patients with both MDD and HIV/AIDS, over a six-year study period. The study population was determined by the following inclusion criteria: patients older than 18 years, MDD should be diagnosed by a psychiatrist supported by an appropriate ICD-10 code, and all patients have to be on combination antiretroviral treatment (cARV) treatment. The medicine possession ratio (MPR) was used as proxy to determine patient compliance with AD medication. Results: 127 patients (i.e. 0.24%) met the criteria of co-morbid MDD and HIV/AIDS. Females have a significantly higher prevalence of MDD and HIV/AIDS when compared to males. Patients diagnosed with both HIV/AIDS and MDD (74.43. ± 32.03, 95% Cl: 71.51-77.34) have a statistical significantly (p < 0.0001) lower compliance with AD treatment vs. MDD patients (80.94% ± 29.44, 95% Cl: 80.56-81.33), but the practical significance thereof, is low (Cohen's d = 0.2255). In this group only 26.83% of TCA had acceptable compliance compared to the 58.57% of SNRIs. Noteworthy observations were that 75% (p < 0.0217; Cramer's V = 0.0388) of venlafaxine and 28.6% (p < 0.0197; Cramer's V = -0.0705) of the paroxetine items were compliant in patients diagnosed with both HIV/AIDS and MDD. Conclusions: AD compliance is statistical significantly lower in depressed HIV/AIDS vs. depressed non-HIV/AIDS patients. However, these differences is of low practical or clinical significance, meaning that depressed HIV/AIDS patients would have missed approximately two AD doses (6.5% of a 30-day treatment period) more than the non-HIV/AIDS depressed patient over the same treatment period. © Slabbert et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Antidepressants; Compliance; HIV/AIDS; Major depressive disorder; Venlafaxine","UNAIDS World AIDS Day Report 2012; UNAIDS Fact Sheet 2012; Kaiser Family Foundation In Book UNAIDS World AIDS Day Report 2012, , http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/epidemiology/2012/gr2012/20121120_FactSheet_Global_en.pdf, UNAIDS Fact Sheet 2012; Kaiser Family Foundation.

Exosomes from healthy human semen have been shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication and to impair progeny virus infectivity. In this study, we examined the ability of healthy human semen exosomes to restrict HIV-1 and LP-BM5 murine AIDS virus transmission in three different model systems. We show that vaginal cells internalize exosomes with concomitant transfer of functional mRNA. Semen exosomes blocked the spread of HIV-1 from vaginal epithelial cells to target cells in our cell-to-cell infection model and suppressed transmission of HIV-1 across the vaginal epithelial barrier in our trans-well model. Our in vivo model shows that human semen exosomes restrict intravaginal transmission and propagation of murine AIDS virus. Our study highlights an antiretroviral role for semen exosomes that may be harnessed for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat HIV-1 transmission. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Exosome; HIV; LP-BM5 virus; MAIDS; Murine AIDS; Semen; Vaginal epithelia","Alvarez-Erviti, L., Seow, Y., Yin, H., Betts, C., Lakhal, S., Wood, M.J., Delivery of siRNA to the mouse brain by systemic injection of targeted exosomes (2011) Nat.

We find a strong association, and that it is primarily due to higher HIV risk among violent men; neither women's decreased ability to protect themselves from HIV within marriage, nor their risky sexual behavior, explains the link. Thus, it is not violence per se that spreads HIV, but that violent men are more likely to become HIV positive and then infect their wives. Programs that aim at reducing HIV by eliminating IPV should therefore also focus on men's risky sexual behavior. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","AIDS; Domestic violence; Gender inequality; HIV; Intimate partner violence","Abadie, A., Imbens, G.W., Large sample properties of matching estimators for average treatment effects (2006) Econometrica, 74 (1), pp. 235-267; Abadie, A., Imbens, G.W., Bias-corrected matching estimators for average treatment effects (2011) Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, 29 (1), pp. 1-11; Andersson, N., Cockcroft, A., Shea, B., Intimate partner violence and HIV: Relevance for HIV prevention in hyperendemic countries in Southern Africa (2008) AIDS, 22, pp. S73-S86; Angrist, J., Pischke, J.-S., (2009) Mostly harmless econometrics: An empiricist's companion, , Princeton Press, Princeton; Béné, C., Merten, S., Women and fish-for-sex: Transactional sex, HIV/AIDS and gender in African fisheries (2008) World Development, 36 (5), pp. 875-899; Bryceson, D.F., Fonseca, J., Risking death for survival: Peasant responses to hunger and HIV/AIDS in Malawi (2006) World Development, 34 (8), pp. 1654-1666; Castor, D., Cook, S., Leclerc-Madlala, S., Shelton, J., Intimate-partner violence and HIV in South African women (2010) The Lancet, 376 (9748), p. 1219; Crump, R.K., Hotz, V.J., Imbens, G.W., Mitnik, O.A., Dealing with limited overlap in estimation of average treatment effects (2009) Biometrika, 96 (1), pp. 187-199; Dude, A.M., Spousal intimate partner violence is associated with HIV and other STIs among married Rwandan women (2011) AIDS and Behavior, 15 (1), pp. 142-152; Dunkle, K.L., Decker, M.R., Gender-based violence and HIV: Reviewing the evidence for links and causal pathways in the general population and high-risk groups (2013) American Journal of Reproductive Immunology, 69 (S 1), pp. 20-26; Durevall, D., Lindskog, A., Economic inequality and HIV in Malawi (2012) World Development, 40 (7), pp. 1435-1451; Ehrensaft, M.K., Cohen, P., Brown, J., Smailes, E., Chen, H., Johnson, J.G., Intergenerational transmission of partner violence: A 20-year prospective study (2003) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 71 (4), pp. 741-753; Epstein, H., Intimate-partner violence and HIV in South African women (2010) The Lancet, 376 (9748), p. 1219; Fox, J., Fidler, S., Sexual transmission of HIV-1 (2010) Antiviral Research, 85 (1), pp. 276-285; Gillespie, S., Kadiyala, S., Greener, R., Is poverty or wealth driving HIV transmission?

Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of data of CLHIV attending Prayas clinic, Pune, India. Height and weight z scores (HAZ, WAZ) were calculated using WHO growth charts. Catch-up growth post-ART was assessed using a mixed method model in cases where baseline and at least one subsequent follow-up HAZ/WAZ were available. STATA 12 was used for statistical analysis. Results: During 1998 to 2011, 466 children were enrolled (201 girls and 265 boys; median age = 7 y). A total of 302 children were ever started on ART; of which 73 and 76 children were included for analysis for catch up growth in WAZ and HAZ respectively. Median WAZ and HAZ increased from −2.14 to −1.34 (p = 0.007) and −2.42 to −1.94 (p = 0.34), respectively, 3 y post ART. Multivariable analysis using mixed model (adjusted for gender, guardianship, baseline age, baseline WAZ/HAZ, baseline and time varying WHO clinical stage) showed gains in WAZ (coef = 0.2, 95 % CI: −0.06 to 0.46) and HAZ (coef = 0.49, 95 % CI: 0.21 to 0.77) with time on ART. Lower baseline WAZ/HAZ and older age were associated with impaired catch-up growth. Children staying in institutions and with baseline advanced clinical stage showed higher gain in WAZ. Conclusions: The prevalence of stunting and underweight was high at ART initiation. Sustained catch-up growth was seen with ART. The study highlights the benefit of early ART in achieving normal growth in CLHIV. © 2015, Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.","Anti-retroviral therapy; Catch up growth; Growth failure; HIV infected children; HIV/AIDS","Borja MC, Peckham C; European Collaborative Study.

Hepatic TB has become more prevalent, likely as a result of the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic. We sought to review case series to characterize the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of hepatic TB and to comment on the impact of HIV co-infection on these characteristics. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed and ScienceDirect for articles pertaining to hepatic TB with human subjects from 1960 to July 2013. Results: We obtained data on 618 hepatic TB patients from 14 case series. The most common reported signs and symptoms were hepatomegaly (median: 80%, range: 10-100%), fever (median: 67%, range: 30-100), respiratory symptoms (median: 66%, range: 32-78%), abdominal pain (median: 59.5%, range: 40-83%), and weight loss (median: 57.5%, range: 20-100%). Common laboratory abnormalities were elevated alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Ultrasound and computerized tomography (CT) were sensitive but non-specific. On liver biopsy, smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli had a median sensitivity of 25% (range: 0-59%), histology of caseating granulomas had a median sensitivity of 68% (range: 14-100%), and polymerase chain reaction for TB had a median sensitivity of 86% (range: 30-100%). Standard anti-tuberculous chemotherapy for 6 to 12 months achieved positive outcomes for nearly all patients with drug-susceptible TB. Conclusions: Clinicians in TB-endemic regions should maintain a high index of suspicion for hepatic TB in patients presenting with hepatomegaly, fever, respiratory symptoms, and elevated liver enzymes. The most sensitive imaging modality is a CT scan, while the most specific diagnostic modality is a liver biopsy with nucleic acid testing of liver tissue samples. Upon diagnosis, 4-drug anti-TB therapy should promptly be initiated.

The large-field imaging system was fabricated by a microcavity array and a two-dimensional (2D) photosensor within the desk-top-sized instrument. The microcavity array was employed to separate leukocytes from whole blood based on differences in the size of leukocytes and other blood cells. The large-field imaging system with lower side irradiation enabled acquisition of cell signatures with high signal-to-noise ratio, because the metallic substrate of the microcavity array obstructed excessive excitation light. In this setting, dual-color imaging of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was achieved within the entire image area (64mm2) in 2s. The practical performance of the large-field imaging system was demonstrated by determining the CD4/CD8 ratio in a few microliter of control whole blood as small as those obtained by a finger prick. The CD4/CD8 ratios measured using the large-field imaging system correlated well with those measured by microscopic analysis. These results indicate that our proposed system provides a simple and rapid CD4 testing for the application of HIV/AIDS treatment. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","2D photosensor; CD4 testing; HIV/AIDS treatment; Large-field imaging system; Microcavity array","Boyle, D.S., Hawkins, K.R., Steele, M.S., Singhal, M., Cheng, X., (2012) Trends Biotechnol., 30 (1), pp. 45-54; Davis, K.A., Abrams, B., Iyer, S.B., Hoffman, R.A., Bishop, J.E., (1998) Cytometry, 33 (2), pp. 197-205; Hosokawa, M., Asami, M., Nakamura, S., Yoshino, T., Tsujimura, N., Takahashi, M., Nakasono, S., Matsunaga, T., (2012) Biotechnol.

Adherence of at least 95% is needed to keep HIV under control, as per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. This study was aimed at identifying the overall adherence level of, and barriers and facilitators to adherence for patients taking ART in different clinics in all five development regions of Nepal. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among ART clients receiving free ART from Government of Nepal ART clinics. A total of 435 clients taking ART from twelve ART clinics in different regions of Nepal, aged fifteen years and above were interviewed on one-and-one basis using questionnaires developed in reference to Adult AIDS Clinical Trial Group (AACTG) toolkit among them data from 404 were analyzed after cleaning. Data was entered and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software where the P value of < 0.05 was accepted as being statistically significant. Results: The overall adherence in the last month (missed less than three pills total) was 94.8% (383 out of 404). The main barrier to ART adherence was the fear of side effects (among 61.9% of the non adherent population) which included dizziness (18.1%) and headaches (15.4%). The standard wristwatch (39%) was found to be the most useful aid in enabling timely consumption of medication. Educational status (P = 0.018), drug using habits (P = 0.039) and the conducive environment at ART clinics (P = 0.004) were significantly associated with ART adherence. Conclusion: Improving better adherence may require a more holistic approach to treatment regimen and adapting it to patient daily routines. This study identifies issues such as pill count for assessing adherence, better access to health care facilities by clients, better access to medication, as well as improved nutritional support issues for better adherence by the population in the future. © 2015 Bam et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Adherence; AIDS; Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART); Barriers; Facilitators; HIV; Nepal",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928975727

Achieving the UNAIDS 90-90-90 target by 2020 and ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 depend on success in this region. We review epidemiological trends in each country in southern Africa with respect to the prevalence, incidence, mortality, coverage of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and TB notification rates, to better understand progress in controlling HIV and TB and to determine what needs to be done to reach the UNAIDS targets. Significant progress has been made in controlling HIV. In all countries in the region, the prevalence of HIV in people not on ART, the incidence of HIV, AIDS-related mortality and, in most countries, TB notification rates, are falling. In some countries, the risk of infection began to fall before biomedical interventions such as ART became widely available as a result of effective prevention measures or people’s awareness of, and response to, the epidemic but the reasons for these declines remain uncertain. Some countries have achieved better levels of ART coverage than others, but all are in a position to reach the 2020 and 2030 targets if they accelerate the roll-out of ART and of targeted prevention efforts. Achieving the HIV treatment targets will further reduce the incidence of HIV-related TB, but efforts to control TB in HIV-negative people must be improved and strengthened. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","ART; Eastern and Southern Africa; Ending AIDS; HIV; TB; UNAIDS targets",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928676084

In order to respond to this changing epidemiological profile in Senegal, multi-lateral and national AIDS actors require information about these emerging trends in unstudied populations. To that end, this study has several objectives, first, to assess local dynamics of sexual behaviors among individuals at popular socializing venues in areas at increased risk of HIV transmission; and then to examine how particular venues may influence risks of HIV transmission. In 2013 we collected data at 314 venues in 10 cities in Senegal using PLACE methodology. These venues were listed with collaboration of 374 community informants. They are places where commercial sex workers, MSM, and individuals who are not part of any identified risk group socialize and meet new sexual partners. We conducted 2600 interviews at the 96 most popular venues. A significant portion of the sample reports buying or selling sex and the majority engaged in behavior considered high-risk for transmitting sexual infections. Almost a quarter of patrons interviewed in venues were young people aged 15-24 years. Types of venues described were very diverse. Half of them were venues (n=156) where sex workers could be solicited and almost a third were venues where MSM could meet male partners (n=90). The study showed existing pockets of vulnerability to HIV in Thies, Bignona or Saly that are not evident from aggregate HIV data.

However, it is unknown whether HBV vaccine responsiveness is associated with improved immune reconstitution during treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). We evaluated the relationship between HBV vaccine response status and CD4 reconstitution on cART in the U.S Military HIV Natural History Study. Methods: Participants with viral load <400 copies/mL within 1 year on initial cART and documented HBV vaccination and surface antibody (anti-HBs) prior to cART were included. Participants were characterized as HBV vaccine responders (anti-HBs ≥10 IU/L) or non-responders (<10 IU/L) and further divided into 2 groups based on vaccine administration before or after HIV diagnosis. Linear mixed regression was used to model CD4 reconstitution during the first year of cART. Results: Of the 307 and 169 participants vaccinated before or after HIV diagnosis, HBV vaccine response occurred in 288 (94%) and 74 (44%), respectively. For those vaccinated before HIV diagnosis, CD4 counts increased by a median 190 [IQR 99-310] cells/mm3 for responders and 186 [IQR 116-366] cells/mm3 for non-responders during the first year (P = 0.684). Participants vaccinated after HIV diagnosis had median increases of 185 [IQR 76-270] and 143 [IQR 47-238] cells/mm3 for responders and non-responders, respectively (P = 0.134). In contrast to those with CD4 > 350 cells/mm3 at cART initiation, participants with CD4 < 200 and 200-350 cells/mm3 had significantly reduced CD4 gains in both groups by longitudinal mixed models, but there was no difference in CD4 recovery according to HBV vaccine seroresponse. Conclusions: Although HBV vaccine responsiveness is associated with a reduction in HIV disease progression, HBV vaccine responders do not achieve greater CD4 gains during the first year of cART. Additional clinical markers are needed to predict the magnitude of post-cART immune recovery. © 2015 Allen et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","AIDS; Antiretroviral therapy; CD4 cell count; Hepatitis B vaccine; HIV",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928800265

Although chronic household illness has shown to be a predictor for physical and emotional abuse, no research has thus far investigated the different pathways from household chronic illness to child abuse victimisation in South Africa. Methods: Confidential self-report questionnaires using internationally utilised measures were completed by children aged 10-17 (n = 3515, 56.7% female) using door-to-door sampling in randomly selected areas in rural and urban locations of South Africa. Follow-up surveys were conducted a year later (96.7% retention rate). Using multiple mediation analyses, this study investigated direct and indirect effects of chronic household illness (AIDS or other illness) on frequent (monthly) physical and emotional abuse victimisation with poverty and extent of the ill person's disability as hypothesised mediators. Results: For children in AIDS-ill families, a positive direct effect on physical abuse was obtained. In addition, positive indirect effects through poverty and disability were established. For boys, a positive direct and indirect effect of AIDS-illness on emotional abuse through poverty were detected. For girls, a positive indirect effect through poverty was observed. For children in households with other chronic illness, a negative indirect effect on physical abuse was obtained. In addition, a negative indirect effect through poverty and positive indirect effect through disability was established. For boys, positive and negative indirect effects through poverty and disability were found respectively. For girls, a negative indirect effect through poverty was observed. Conclusions: These results indicate that children in families affected by AIDS-illness are at higher risk of child abuse victimisation, and this risk is mediated by higher levels of poverty and disability. Children affected by other chronic illness are at lower risk for abuse victimisation unless they are subject to higher levels of household disability. Interventions aiming to reduce poverty and increase family support may help prevent child abuse in families experiencing illness in South Africa. © 2015 Meinck et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Adolescent abuse; Child abuse; Chronic illness; HIV/AIDS; Predictors; Risk factor",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928978540

Adolescents are ill equipped to deal with the impending changes in their body which makes them vulnerable to STDs, HIV/AIDS and premarital sex. This study attempts to study the impact of reproductive health education on the knowledge, attitude and practices of teachers, about which only a few studies are available. Aims: To study the impact of health education on the knowledge, attitude and practices of teachers regarding reproductive health of adolescents. Settings: Senior Secondary schools of Amritsar and Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Amritsar, Punjab, India. Study participants: Male teachers of senior secondary schools of Amritsar teaching class 9th-12th. Study design: Educational intervention study. Sampling method: Purposive sampling. Materials and Methods: The study was started with 155 teachers (teaching class 9th -12th) who willingly participated from 50 senior secondary schools of Amritsar district. It was carried out in three phases. In first phase, after taking informed consent, the teachers filled a pretested questionnaire which was followed by an interactive session on reproductive health in second phase. In third phase, to study the impact of the interactive session and the sustainability of knowledge gained, they were again administered the same questionnaire after a period of 3 months. Statistical Analysis: Microsoft Excel, SPSS, Chi-square test. Results: Maximum 74 (47.7%) teachers were aware of the psychosocial problems of adolescents. Majority 110 (71%) of the teachers had only partial knowledge about pubertal changes. 117 (75.5%) teachers were unaware about genital hygiene. Only 33 (21.3%) teachers had adequate knowledge about different STDs. 91 (58.7%) and 54 (34.8%) of teachers had adequate knowledge about routes of transmission and prevention of AIDS respectively. Only 37 (23.9%) teachers were imparting sex education to students. After intervention significant favorable changes were seen in their knowledge, attitude and practices regarding most of above mentioned topics. Conclusion: Although the baseline knowledge of teachers in most aspects of reproductive health of adolescents was found to be low, significant favourable changes were observed after health education. © 2015, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

However, a recent sub-Saharan African review was unable to show increased effectiveness for theory-based interventions. This study assessed whether the predictive value of attitudes, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and intention was similar to studies in Europe and the U.S., and whether there were differences between three sub-Saharan sites. Longitudinal multigroup structural equation modeling was used to assess whether attitudes, subjective norms, and self-efficacy predicted condom use intentions and condom use (after 6 months) among adolescents in three sites, namely Cape Town (South Africa; N = 625), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania; N = 271), and Mankweng (South Africa; N = 404). Condom use intentions were predicted by subjective norms and self-efficacy in all three sites. Attitudes were not related to intentions in Dar es Salaam and were moderately related to intentions in Cape Town and Mankweng. The proportions of explained variance in intentions and behavior were decent (37–52 and 9–19 %, respectively). Although significant differences in predictive value were found between sites and in comparison to European and U.S. studies, intentions could adequately be explained by attitudes, subjective norms, and self-efficacy. However, the limited proportions of variance in behavior explained by intentions could signify the importance of contextual and environmental factors. Future studies are recommended to use an integrative approach that takes into account both individual and contextual factors, as well as social and environmental differences. © 2015 The Author(s)","AIDS; Condom use; HIV; Sexual risk behavior; Sub-Saharan Africa; Theory of planned behavior",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928681269

This study was undertaken in order to understand the impact of substance use on care outcomes for HIV-infected individuals in Manitoba. Clinical records of 564 HIV-infected individuals in care at Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba were reviewed. Clinical data were extracted from patient charts for substance users (illicit substance users, alcohol abusers and chronic users of opioids or benzodiazepines) and non-users. Substance users and non-users were analysed using chi-square analysis and logistic regression models to compare basic socio-demographic and clinic variables. Chi-square and analysis of variance were used to compare a subset of substance users based on similar socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. Among HIV-infected individuals in Manitoba, 38% were substance users with over-representation by Aboriginals, females, young adults and residents of Winnipeg's core areas. Opioids and benzodiazepines were the most commonly used substances with the majority of substance users having used multiple classes of substances in their lifetime. Substance users were more likely than non-users to have missed clinic appointments. Among substance users, missed appointments were more common among those who self-identified as Aboriginal, female, young adults, residents of Winnipeg's core areas, heterosexuals and those who had abused alcohol or cocaine/crack. Aboriginal substance users were also less likely to achieve viral load suppression compared to non-Aboriginal substance users. With the high prevalence of substance use among HIV-infected individuals in Manitoba, it is important to identify at-risk individuals in order to implement appropriate care strategies and improve treatment adherence and health outcomes. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","AIDS; care outcomes; epidemiology; HIV; Manitoba; substance use",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928788883

Data was analyzed using content analysis. Alcohol use was prevalent and said to influence risky sex. Sex-related alcohol expectancies and occupational factors influenced individuals to drink during sex and structural factors related to the built environment, economy, and policy were identified as key contributors to both alcohol use and sexual risk in general. The findings highlight alcohol reduction as an important component of HIV/AIDS prevention and suggest structural interventions should be prioritized in this context. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Alcohol; Commercial sex workers; Fisherfolk; HIV/AIDS; Qualitative; Social ecology",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928607346

By utilising a variety of sources, the article draws a picture of the early prevention campaign that ended in crisis in 1990, the consequent refurbishment of anti-AIDS efforts in the early 1990s and the ideological and practical problems they faced. The article argues that before the mid-1990s the HIV prevention measures were reluctantly accepted by the majority of Ugandans and that not only the Ugandan public, but also the political leaders, donors and professionals involved in AIDS control in the early 1990s recognised this. The article puts the making of the Ugandan ‘success story’ in its historical context, suggesting that it may have involved motives of great urgency and significance for the future of anti-AIDS work in sub-Saharan Africa. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","history; HIV prevention; HIV/AIDS; moralism; sexual behaviour; Uganda",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929008649

Fletcher AveTampa, FL, United States","Background: HIV-infected long-term non-progressor (LTNP) subjects can prevent viral replication and may harbor useful information for the development of both antibody and active vaccination treatments. In this study we used LTNP sera to examine the epitopes presented to the gp160 protein, and from this procedure we hope to elucidate potential biomarkers pertaining to the level of resistance a patient may have in developing AIDS after infection with HIV. We used five clinical sera samples from LTNP patients to identify common epitopes by ELISA; peptides with high binding to sera were selected and analyzed for conservation among HIV clades. Antibodies were generated against one identified epitope using a chimeric peptide in BALB/c mice, and both the sera from these mice and LTNP sera were tested for viral inhibition capabilities. Results: A monoclonal antibody, CL3, against one identified epitope was used to compare these epitopes neutralizing capability. LTNP sera was also studied to determine chemokine/cytokine changes in these patients. The sera from LTNP patients 2, 3, 4, and 5 were identified as having the highest titers, and also significantly inhibited syncytia formation in vitro. Finally, the protein cytokine array demonstrated that I-309 and IGFBP-1 decreased in LTNPs, but levels of TIMP-1 and NAP-2 increased significantly. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the use of LTNP samples may be a useful for identifying further anti-viral epitopes, and may be a possible predictor for determining if patients show higher resistances of converting the HIV infection to AIDS. © Hao et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","AIDS; Epitope; HIV; Long-term non-progressor; LTNP; Monoclonal antibody; Virus","Penaloza-MacMaster, P., Masopust, D., Ahmed, R., T-cell reconstitution without T-cell immunopathology in two models of T-cell-mediated tissue destruction (2009) Immunology, 128 (2), pp. 164-171; Smalls-Mantey, A., Doria-Rose, N., Klein, R., Patamawenu, A., Migueles, S.A., Ko, S.Y., Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against primary HIV-infected CD4+ T cells is directly associated with the magnitude of surface IgG binding (2012) J Virol, 86 (16), pp. 8672-8680; Beasley, R.P., Hwang, L.Y., Lin, C.C., Stevens, C.E., Wang, K.Y., Sun, T.S., Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) efficacy in the interruption of perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus carrier state.

Thus, we examined these associations among 18-24 year old post-secondary school students in Tbilisi, Georgia. Methods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of a 2010 cross-sectional survey of 1,879 secondary and post-secondary school students aged 15 to 24 years in Tbilisi, Georgia examining sociodemographics, substance use, sexual behavior, HIV-related knowledge and stigmatizing attitudes, and recreational activities in relation to lifetime HCT. A stratified two-stage cluster sample design was used by the parent study with universities selected with probabilities proportional to their size at the first stage, and with a random selection of students stratified by gender in each of the participating university at the second stage. Results: The vast majority (95.6%) of participants never received HCT. In the multivariate regression model, significant predictors of lifetime receipt of HCT included being married (p = 0.03), not having HIV stigmatized attitude (p = 0.03), more often reading fiction literature (p = 0.02), more often going out in the evenings (p = 0.03), and more often passing time with friends (p = 0.05). Conclusions: Intervening on HIV stigmatizing attitudes may be a critical prevention or HCT promotion strategy among youth in Georgia. In order to better inform policy and programs, future research should examine contextual factors in secondary and post-secondary schools that impact HCT among Georgian youth. Specifically, factors impacting differential rates of HCT among males and females, the social stigma and knowledge related to HCT and HIV, and the impact of leisure time activity involvement on HCT should be examined further. In addition, interventions and policies that might impact attitudes toward HIV and HCT should be investigated and considered. © 2015 Djibuti et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","AIDS; Georgia; HIV; HIV counseling and testing; Stigma; Youth",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928957982

Experiences and types of stigma are diverse, and vary across cultural settings. Consequently, research that places stigma within appropriate socio-cultural contexts should be the first step towards developing effective HIV-prevention interventions. This study examined the stigma related to engaging in sex work in a group of FSW in the Dominican Republic. The present investigation used the Sex Worker Stigma (SWS) Index to identify factors associated with sex work-related stigma along two perceived stigma domains: the community and family. A verbally administered, tablet-based questionnaire was completed by 338 FSW. Results indicate that multiple independent factors influence perceived sex work-related stigma from community and family sources. FSW who engage in sex work on an independent basis, Haitian FSW, and women who live in the same household as their dependent children perceive less sex work-related stigma from the community. Conversely, FSW who spend more time engaged in sex work per week perceive more sex work-related stigma from this source. Within the family domain, women who live in the same household as their dependent children and FSW with higher levels of education perceive less stigma from family members. FSW who provide the principal household economic support perceive more sex work-related stigma from family members. Findings show that sex work-related stigma is unique and should be taken into account for interventions focused on HIV prevention and/or stigma in female sex workers. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Female sex work; HIV/AIDS; Stigma",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928591807

It examines the factors that correlate to gender violence in Malawi, including cultural attitudes towards violence, spousal violence factors, and HIV risk factors. Structural equation modeling (SEM) identifies associations among these constructs. A perfect model fit was achieved to build a simultaneous model that includes attitudes towards violence, violence factors, and HIV risk (GFI = .998). Education attainment (.039) and number of partners (.120) had a weaker association with HIV risk than condom use (.418) and HIV testing (.412). We hypothesized that gender attitudes and incidents of violence would be related to greater risks for HIV infection among women. SEM affirmed a robust association between attitudes towards violence and how women in Malawi perceive gender violence. We conclude that policy and practice design should acknowledge the impact of cultural, educational, and familial characteristics on the populations in order to achieve robust change to reduce HIV transmissions especially among women in Malawi. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Attitudes; Culture and sexuality; HIV/AIDS; Malawi; Women",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928380460

However, encouraging men to acknowledge their risk for HIV, to test and link to treatment remains a challenge. In this study, we examine men’s perspectives on navigating HIV risk in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Qualitative interviews were conducted at four intervals over a three-year time period with a baseline cohort of 126 men and women. We found that men navigated HIV risk in their sexual relationships mainly by monitoring their partner’s behaviour. Men expressed concerns about female respectability, invoking discourses on hlonipha rooted in Zulu cultural ideals and Christian ideals about women staying close to home. In the post-apartheid era, these concerns were inflected by anxieties over changing gender norms and the high rates and risks of infection in the region. HIV prevention discourses on behaviour intersected with men’s efforts to assert their masculinity through the monitoring and controlling of women’s behaviour. The potential negative impacts of this should be addressed. Prevention efforts need to focus on men’s vulnerability to infection in terms of their own behaviour as well as the contexts in which they live. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","community interventions; HIV/AIDS; men; relationships; South Africa",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928254386

Data was collected by conducting participant interviews and medical records abstraction. HIV-related stigma was assessed using the internalized AIDS-related stigma scale (IA-RSS). Exploratory factor analysis of the IA-RSS indicated that the scale consisted of two factors: (1) internalized stigma and (2) anticipated stigma. Of the 447 sampled participants 23.9% had a higher level of internalized stigma and 38.3% had a higher level of anticipated stigma. Multivariate analysis indicated that among females, internalized stigma was associated with being diagnosed HIV positive after the introduction of HAART in 1996 (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.2, 3.1; P < 0.01) and a diagnosis of depression (adjusted PR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.2, 2.9; P < 0.01). Among males, anticipated stigma was associated with younger age (18 and 39 years) (adjusted PR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.2; P < 0.001) and use of non-injection drugs (adjusted PR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.86; P < 0.01). Findings suggest that there may be gender-specific differences among factors associated with different dimensions of HIV-related stigma. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","depression; gender; HIV-related stigma; HIV/AIDS; internalized",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928592419

We aimed to estimate the incidence and to evaluate the risk factors of CDI among an HIV cohort in Italy. Methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control (1:2) study. Clinical records of HIV inpatients admitted to the National Institute for Infectious Disease ""L. Spallanzani"", Rome, were reviewed (2002-2013). Cases: HIV inpatients with HO-HCFA CDI, and controls: HIV inpatients without CDI, were matched by gender and age. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with CDI. Results: We found 79 CDI episodes (5.1 per 1000 HIV hospital admissions, 3.4 per 10000 HIV patient-days). The mean age of cases was 46 years. At univariate analysis factors associated with CDI included: antimycobacterial drug exposure, treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia, acid suppressant exposure, previous hospitalization, antibiotic exposure, low CD4 cell count, high Charlson score, low creatinine, low albumin and low gammaglobulin level. Using multivariate analysis, lower gammaglobulin level and low serum albumin at admission were independently associated with CDI among HIV-infected patients. Conclusions: Low gammaglobulin and low albumin levels at admission are associated with an increased risk of developing CDI. A deficiency in humoral immunity appears to play a major role in the development of CDI. The potential protective role of albumin warrants further investigation. © Di Bella et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","AIDS; Albumin; Case-control; Clostridium difficile; Gammaglobulins; HIV; Risk factors","Freeman, J., Bauer, M.P., Baines, S.D., Corver, J., Fawley, W.N., Goorhuis, B., The changing epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infections (2010) Clin Microbiol Rev, 23, pp. 529-549; Alonso, C.D., Treadway, S.B., Hanna, D.B., Huff, C.A., Neofytos, D., Carroll, K.C., Epidemiology and outcomes of Clostridium difficile infections in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (2012) Clin Infect Dis, 54, pp. 1053-1063; Dubberke, E.R., Burdette, S.D., Clostridium difficile infections in solid organ transplantation (2013) Am J Transplant, 13, pp. 42-49; Haines, C.F., Moore, R.D., Bartlett, J.G., Sears, C.L., Cosgrove, S.E., Carroll, K., Clostridium difficile in a HIV-infected cohort: incidence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes (2013) AIDS, 27, pp. 2799-2807; Collini, P.J., Bauer, M., Kuijper, E., Dockrell, D.H., Clostridium difficile infection in HIV-seropositive individuals and transplant recipients (2012) J Infect, 64, pp. 131-147; Pepin, J., Valiquette, L., Alary, M.E., Villemure, P., Pelletier, A., Forget, K., Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in a region of Quebec from 1991 to 2003: a changing pattern of disease severity (2004) CMAJ, 171, pp. 466-472; McDonald, L.C., Owings, M., Jernigan, D.B., Clostridium difficile infection in patients discharged from US short-stay hospitals, 1996-2003 (2006) Emerg Infect Dis, 12, pp. 409-415; Dial, S., Alrasadi, K., Manoukian, C., Huang, A., Menzies, D., Risk of Clostridium difficile diarrhea among hospital inpatients prescribed proton pump inhibitors: cohort and case-control studies (2004) CMAJ, 171, pp. 33-38; Issa, M., Ananthakrishnan, A.N., Binion, D.G., Clostridium difficile and inflammatory bowel disease (2008) Inflamm Bowel Dis, 14, pp. 1432-1442; Kelly, C.P., LaMont, J.T., Clostridium difficile-more difficult than ever (2008) N Engl J Med, 359, pp. 1932-1940; Tickler, I.A., Goering, R.V., Whitmore, J.D., Lynn, A.N., Persing, D.H., Tenover, F.C., Strain Types and Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns of Clostridium difficile Isolates from the United States, 2011 to 2013 (2014) Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 58, pp. 4214-4218; He, M., Miyajima, F., Roberts, P., Ellison, L., Pickard, D.J., Martin, M.J., Emergence and global spread of epidemic healthcare-associated Clostridium difficile (2013) Nat Genet, 45, pp. 109-113; Cohen, S.H., Gerding, D.N., Johnson, S., Kelly, C.P., Loo, V.G., McDonald, L.C., Clinical practice guidelines for Clostridium difficile infection in adults: 2010 update by the society for healthcare epidemiology of America (SHEA) and the infectious diseases society of America (IDSA) (2010) Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol, 31, pp. 431-455; Hosmer, D., Lemeshow, S., (2000) Applied Logistic Regression, , 2nd ed.

Accordingly, this paper explores the extent to which meaningful accommodation between the biomedical and traditional sectors is possible (and/or even desirable). It does this through a consideration of Native American and South African experiences, looking at how the respective groups, in which medical pluralism is common, have addressed the issue of HIV/AIDS.

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used. Studies were identified through electronic databases, grey literature, reference harvesting and contacts with key researchers. Quality of findings was assessed through an adapted version of the Cambridge Quality Checklists. A total of 590 potentially relevant titles were identified. Seventeen peer-reviewed articles and one draft book chapter were included. Studies investigated socio-demographic, HIV-related, intra-personal and interpersonal correlates of internalised stigma. Eleven articles used cross-sectional data, six articles used prospective cohort data and one used both prospective cohort and cross-sectional data to assess correlates of internalised stigma. Poor HIV-related health weakly predicted increases in internalised HIV stigma in three longitudinal studies. Lower depression scores and improvements in overall mental health predicted reductions in internalised HIV stigma in two longitudinal studies, with moderate and weak effects, respectively. No other consistent predictors were found. Studies utilising analysis of change and accounting for confounding factors are necessary to guide policy and programming but are scarce. High-risk populations, other stigma markers that might layer upon internalised stigma, and structural drivers of internalised stigma need to be examined. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","HIV/AIDS; self-image; self-perception; shame; stigma; systematic review",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928252493

In China, a setting of acute HIV stigma where family harmony is culturally valued, limited research has been conducted on parental disclosure. We aimed to develop a model of parental disclosure that accounts for the cultural context in China based on a mixed-methods study. In our individual, in-depth interviews (N = 24) as well as survey data (N = 84) collected from parents living with HIV in Shanghai and Beijing, we found the primary barriers to disclosure were stigma, fear of exposing the mode by which they acquired HIV, psychologically burdening the child, rejection by the child, and negative social consequences for the family. Parents concurrently cited many motivations for disclosure, such as disease progression, ensuring safety of the child, gaining assistance, and fulfilling their parental responsibility. Most parents had not actively disclosed their HIV status (68 %); many parents reported some form of partial disclosure (e.g., sharing they have a blood disease but not labeling it HIV), unplanned disclosure, or unintentional disclosure to their children by other people. Findings informed the development of a Chinese Parental HIV Disclosure Model, with primary components accounting for distal cultural factors, decision-making (balancing approach and avoid motivations), the disclosure event, and outcomes resulting from the disclosure. This model highlights the cultural context of the Chinese parental disclosure process, and may be useful in guiding future observational research and intervention work. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Children; China; Disclosure; HIV/AIDS; Parents",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927926796

Informal caregivers, or persons providing unpaid emotional or instrumental support, have protective effects on the health and well-being of PLHIV. Research suggests that social support, including care recipients' reciprocity of emotional support, is important to sustained caregiving. This study examined HIV caregivers' perceived emotional support over time from their current or former injection drug-using care recipients. Data were from baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up of the BEACON study. Latent growth curve analysis showed a decline in reciprocated emotional support reports over time, particularly among caregivers themselves HIV seropositive or currently substance using. Researchers should develop interventions to strengthen the caregiving relationship by promoting reciprocity of emotional support, with implications for sustaining caregiving to vulnerable PLHIV and improving their health outcomes. Interventions should especially target dyads in which caregivers are also HIV positive or using substances. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","emotional support; HIV/AIDS; informal caregivers; reciprocity; substance use",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928034793

Young people experience substantial psychosocial and neurocognitive change between adolescence and emerging adulthood which impacts engagement in risk behaviors. We aimed to examine developmental change in the association between sexual partnership characteristics and condomless anal intercourse (CAI). Data were taken from an analytic sample of 114 young adult MSM from a longitudinal study of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth with 4-year follow-up. Rates of CAI were approximately 12 times higher in serious compared to casual partnerships, but this effect diminished in size over time. Partner age differences and violence were associated with more CAI, and these associations strengthened across development. Characteristics of serious relationships (e.g., power dynamics) were also examined. We discuss the need for HIV prevention strategies that address dyadic influences on CAI during this critical developmental period. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Developmental change; Romantic relationships; Young men who have sex with men, HIV/AIDS",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927534735

Methods: An anonymous sexual health questionnaire was distributed in 17 HIV outpatient clinics throughout Europe. Ninety-seven (11.6%) of 838 respondents reported absence of sexual activity. Results: Multivariable regression analysis identified older age, relationship status, and less satisfaction with general health and sexual desire as being associated with sexual inactivity. Conclusions: Prevalence of sexual inactivity has declined since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy to levels similar to those of HIV-negative MSM, suggesting a tendency toward normalization of HIV-positive MSM's sex lives. 2015 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC","Europe; HIV/AIDS; sexual health promotion; sexual inactivity; sexual satisfaction",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928254321

Healers and traditional birth attendants (TBAs) often are a patient’s first and/or preferred line of treatment; this often results in delayed, interrupted, or abandoned diagnosis and therapy. Literature from the study of medical pluralism suggests that HIV care and treatment programs are infrequently and inconsistently engaging healers around the world.

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are highly prevalent in HIV-infected patient populations, including currently infected patients with good access to suppressive antiretroviral therapy (cART). cART decreased the severity of CNS dysfunction dramatically and, in doing so, upended the neuropathological foundation of HAND pathophysiology. It is clear that the working concept of pathophysiology prior to cART, which was driven by inflammation, encephalitis, and neurodegeneration, needs to be replaced. The NeuroAIDS field is reluctant to take that important step. This review explores the fact that the neuropathological concept that drove the field before the era of cART no longer seems to fit with what is commonly observed in patients treated successfully with cART. The field clings to the pre-cART idea that HAND is sequentially driven by virus replication in CNS, brain inflammation (encephalitis), and neurodegeneration. Neurovirological, clinicopathological, and gene expression correlations in cART-treated patients, however, provide little strong support for it. Introducing cART into clinical practice decreased HIVE, inflammation, and degeneration but did not cure HAND. Brain gene array data suggest that the neurovascular unit is a critical target in virally suppressed patients with HAND. The NeuroAIDS field needs an infusion of new ideas to steer research toward issues of the highest relevance to virally suppressed patients. With no suitable replacement immediately within reach, devaluating formative ideas is understandably difficult to accept. The cliniconeuropathological correlation in virally suppressed patients needs to be better defined. © 2015 The Author(s)","Antiretroviral therapy; Dementia; Encephalitis; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders; HIV/AIDS; Metabolic encephalopathy; Neurodegeneration; Neurovirology",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928485712

However, there is a continuing need for new drugs, in particular those acting through new and as yet unexplored mechanisms of action to achieve HIV infection cure. We took advantage of the unique feature of proviral genome to require both activation and inhibition of splicing of viral transcripts to develop molecules capable of achieving long lasting effect on viral replication in humanized mouse models through inhibition of Rev-mediated viral RNA biogenesis. Results: Current HIV therapies reduce viral load during treatment but titers rebound after treatment is discontinued. We devised a new drug that has a long lasting effect after viral load reduction. We demonstrate here that ABX464 compromises HIV replication of clinical isolates of different subtypes without selecting for drug resistance in PBMCs or macrophages. ABX464 alone, also efficiently compromised viral proliferation in two humanized mouse models infected with HIV that require a combination of 3TC, Raltegravir and Tenofovir (HAART) to achieve viral inhibition in current protocols. Crucially, while viral load increased dramatically just one week after stopping HAART treatment, only slight rebound was observed following treatment cessation with ABX464 and the magnitude of the rebound was maintained below to that of HAART for two months after stopping the treatment. Using a system to visualize single HIV RNA molecules in living cells, we show that ABX464 inhibits viral replication by preventing Rev-mediated export of unspliced HIV-1 transcripts to the cytoplasm and by interacting with the Cap Binding Complex (CBC). Deep sequencing of viral RNA from treated cells established that retained viral RNA is massively spliced but importantly, normal cellular splicing is unaffected by the drug. Consistently ABX464 is non-toxic in humans and therefore represents a promising complement to current HIV therapies. Conclusions: ABX464 represents a novel class of anti-HIV molecules with unique properties. ABX464 has a long lasting effect in humanized mice and neutralizes the expression of HIV-1 proviral genome of infected immune cells including reservoirs and it is therefore a promising drug toward a functional cure of HIV. © Campos et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","AIDS; Cap Binding Complex; HIV cure; New antiviral drug; Rev protein; RNA biogenesis; Splicing","Trono, D., Lint, C., Rouzioux, C., Verdin, E., Barré-Sinoussi, F., Chun, T.-W., HIV persistence and the prospect of long-term drug-free remissions for HIV-infected individuals (2010) Science, 329, pp. 174-180; Moir, S., Chun, T.-W., Fauci, A.S., Pathogenic mechanisms of HIV disease (2011) Annu Rev Pathol, 6, pp. 223-248; Chun, T.-W., Fauci, A.S., HIV reservoirs: pathogenesis and obstacles to viral eradication and cure (2012) AIDS, 26, pp. 1261-1268; Richman, D.D., Margolis, D.M., Delaney, M., Greene, W.C., Hazuda, D., Pomerantz, R.J., The challenge of finding a cure for HIV infection (2009) Science, 323, pp. 1304-1307; Richman, D.D., Introduction: challenges to finding a cure for HIV infection (2011) Curr Opin HIV AIDS, 6, pp. 1-3; Purcell, D.F., Martin, M.A., Alternative splicing of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 mRNA modulates viral protein expression, replication, and infectivity (1993) J Virol, 67, pp. 6365-6378; Karn, J., Stoltzfus, C.M., Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of HIV-1 gene expression (2012) Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med, 2; Tazi, J., Bakkour, N., Marchand, V., Ayadi, L., Aboufirassi, A., Branlant, C., Alternative splicing: regulation of HIV-1 multiplication as a target for therapeutic action (2010) FEBS J, 277, pp. 867-876; Suhasini, M., Reddy, T.R., Cellular proteins and HIV-1 Rev function (2009) Curr HIV Res, 7, pp. 91-100; Romani, B., Engelbrecht, S., Glashoff, R.H., Functions of Tat. the versatile protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (2010) J Gen Virol, 91, pp. 1-12; Pollard, V.W., Malim, M.H., The HIV-1 Rev protein (1998) Annu Rev Microbiol, 52, pp. 491-532; Fischer, U., Pollard, V.W., Lührmann, R., Teufel, M., Michael, M.W., Dreyfuss, G., Rev-mediated nuclear export of RNA is dominant over nuclear retention and is coupled to the Ran-GTPase cycle (1999) Nucleic Acids Res, 27, pp. 4128-4134; Bakkour, N., Lin, Y.-L., Maire, S., Ayadi, L., Mahuteau-Betzer, F., Nguyen, C.H., Small-molecule inhibition of HIV pre-mRNA splicing as a novel antiretroviral therapy to overcome drug resistance (2007) PLoS Pathog, 3, pp. 1530-1539; Soret, J., Bakkour, N., Maire, S., Durand, S., Zekri, L., Gabut, M., Selective modification of alternative splicing by indole derivatives that target serine-arginine-rich protein splicing factors (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 102, pp. 8764-8769; Rivalle, C., Wendling, F., Tambourin, P., Lhoste, J.M., Bisagni, E., Chermann, J.C., Antitumor amino-substituted pyrido[3"",4"":4,5]pyrrolo[2,3-g]isoquinolines and pyrido[4,3-b]carbazole derivatives: synthesis and evaluation of compounds resulting from new side chain and heterocycle modifications (1983) J Med Chem, 26, pp. 181-185; Chermann, J.C., Gruest, J., Montagnier, L., Wendling, F., Tambourin, P., Perrin, M., [Cytotoxic and antitumor activity of a new series of heterocyclic compounds: dipyrido (4,3-b) (3,4-f) indoles].

A significant barrier for combating this global pandemic is substance use since it is associated with HIV transmission, delayed diagnosis/initiation of therapy, and poor adherence to therapy. Clinical studies also suggest a link between substance use and HIV-disease progression/AIDS-associated mortality. Methamphetamine (METH) use is one of the fastest-growing substance use problems in the world. METH use enhances high-risk sexual behaviors, therefore increases the likelihood of HIV-1 acquisition. METH use is also associated with higher viral loads, immune dysfunction, and antiretroviral resistance. Moreover, METH use has also been correlated with rapid progression to AIDS. However, direct effects of METH on HIV-1 disease progression remains poorly understood because use of METH and other illicit drugs is often associated with reduced/non adherence to ART. Nevertheless, in vitro studies demonstrate that METH increases HIV-1 replication in cell cultures and animal models. Thus, it has been proposed that METH’s potentiating effects on HIV-1 replication may in part contribute to the worsening of HIV-1 pathogenesis. However, our recent data demonstrate that METH at physiologically relevant concentrations has no effect and at higher concentrations inhibits HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T cells. Thus, the goal of this review is to systematically examine the published literature to better understand the complex interaction between METH abuse and HIV-1 disease progression. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","AIDS; CD4+ T cells; HIV; Methamphetamine",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927537580

Participants (N = 95) were African American/Black and Latino adults with CD4 &lt; 500 cells/mm3 not taking ART, randomized 1:1 to intervention or control arms, the latter receiving treatment as usual. Primary endpoints were adherence, evaluated via ART concentrations in hair samples, and HIV viral load suppression. The intervention was feasible and acceptable. Eight months post-baseline, intervention participants tended to be more likely to evidence “good” (that is, 7 days/week) adherence (60 vs. 26.7 %; p = 0.087; OR = 3.95), and had lower viral load levels than controls (t(22) = 2.29, p = 0.032; OR = 5.20), both large effect sizes.

We examined these relationships retrospectively in a long-term South African ART cohort with multiple time-updated haemoglobin measurements. Methods: Prospectively collected clinical data on patients receiving ART for up to 8years in a community-based cohort were analysed. Time-updated haemoglobin concentrations, CD4 counts and HIV viral loads were recorded, and TB diagnoses and deaths from all causes were ascertained. Anaemia severity was classified using World Health Organization criteria. TB incidence and mortality rates were calculated and Poisson regression models were used to identify independent predictors of incident TB and mortality, respectively. Results: During a median follow-up of 5.0years (IQR, 2.5-5.8) of 1,521 patients, 476 cases of incident TB and 192 deaths occurred during 6,459 person-years (PYs) of follow-up. TB incidence rates were strongly associated with time-updated anaemia severity; those without anaemia had a rate of 4.4 (95%CI, 3.8-5.1) cases/100 PYs compared to 10.0 (95%CI, 8.3-12.1), 26.6 (95%CI, 22.5-31.7) and 87.8 (95%CI, 57.0-138.2) cases/100 PYs in those with mild, moderate and severe anaemia, respectively. Similarly, mortality rates in those with no anaemia or mild, moderate and severe time-updated anaemia were 1.1 (95%CI, 0.8-1.5), 3.5 (95%CI, 2.7-4.8), 11.8 (95%CI, 9.5-14.8) and 28.2 (95%CI, 16.5-51.5) cases/100 PYs, respectively. Moderate and severe anaemia (time-updated) during ART were the strongest independent predictors for incident TB (adjusted IRR = 3.8 [95%CI, 3.0-4.8] and 8.2 [95%CI, 5.3-12.7], respectively) and for mortality (adjusted IRR = 6.0 [95%CI, 3.9-9.2] and adjusted IRR = 8.0 [95%CI, 3.9-16.4], respectively). Conclusions: Increasing severity of anaemia was associated with exceptionally high rates of both incident TB and mortality during long-term ART. Patients receiving ART who have moderate or severe anaemia should be prioritized for TB screening using microbiological assays and may require adjunctive clinical interventions. © Kerkhoff et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Africa; AIDS; Anaemia; Antiretroviral; HIV; Mortality; Tuberculosis","Suthar, A.B., Lawn, S.D., Amo, J., Getahun, H., Dye, C., Sculier, D., Antiretroviral therapy for prevention of tuberculosis in adults with HIV: a systematic review and meta-analysis (2012) PLoS Med, 9, p. e1001270; Gupta, A., Wood, R., Kaplan, R., Bekker, L.-G., Lawn, S.D., Tuberculosis incidence rates during 8years of follow-up of an antiretroviral treatment cohort in South Africa: comparison with rates in the community (2012) PLoS One, 7, p. e34156; Rie, A., Westreich, D., Sanne, I., Tuberculosis in patients receiving antiretroviral treatment: incidence, risk factors, and prevention strategies (2011) J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 56, pp. 349-355; Komati, S., Shaw, P.A., Stubbs, N., Mathibedi, M.J., Malan, L., Sangweni, P., Tuberculosis risk factors and mortality for HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy in South Africa (2010) AIDS, 24, pp. 1849-1855; Moore, D., Liechty, C., Ekwaru, P., Were, W., Mwima, G., Solberg, P., Prevalence, incidence and mortality associated with tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy in rural Uganda (2007) AIDS, 21, pp. 713-719; Lawn, S.D., Myer, L., Bekker, L.-G., Wood, R., Burden of tuberculosis in an antiretroviral treatment programme in sub-Saharan Africa: impact on treatment outcomes and implications for tuberculosis control (2006) AIDS, 20, pp. 1605-1612; Houlihan, C.F., Mutevedzi, P.C., Lessells, R.J., Cooke, G.S., Tanser, F.C., Newell, M.-L., The tuberculosis challenge in a rural South African HIV programme (2010) BMC Infect Dis, 10, p. 23; Hermans, S.M., Kiragga, A.N., Schaefer, P., Kambugu, A., Hoepelman, A.I.M., Manabe, Y.C., Incident tuberculosis during antiretroviral therapy contributes to suboptimal immune reconstitution in a large urban HIV clinic in sub-Saharan Africa (2010) PLoS One, 5, p. e10527; Dembélé, M., Saleri, N., Carvalho, A.C.C., Saouadogo, T., Hien, A.D., Zabsonre, I., Incidence of tuberculosis after HAART initiation in a cohort of HIV-positive patients in Burkina Faso (2010) Int J Tuberc Lung Dis, 14, pp. 318-323; Gupta, A., Wood, R., Kaplan, R., Bekker, L.-G., Lawn, S.D., Prevalent and incident tuberculosis are independent risk factors for mortality among patients accessing antiretroviral therapy in South Africa (2013) PLoS One, 8, p. e55824; Kerkhoff, A.D., Wood, R., Vogt, M., Lawn, S.D., Predictive value of anemia for tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients in sub-Saharan Africa: an indication for routine microbiological investigation using new rapid assays (2014) J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 66, pp. 33-40; Bekker, L.-G., Myer, L., Orrell, C., Lawn, S., Wood, R., Rapid scale-up of a community-based HIV treatment service: programme performance over 3 consecutive years in Guguletu, South Africa (2006) S Afr Med J, 96, pp. 315-320; Lawn, S.D., Myer, L., Orrell, C., Bekker, L.-G., Wood, R., Early mortality among adults accessing a community-based antiretroviral service in South Africa: implications for programme design (2005) AIDS, 19, pp. 2141-2148; Elm, E., Altman, D.G., Egger, M., Pocock, S.J., Gøtzsche, P.C., Vandenbroucke, J.P., The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement: guidelines for reporting observational studies (2007) Lancet, 370, pp. 1453-1457; Haemoglobin concentrations for the diagnosis of anaemia and assessment of severity.

Information about the drugs being developed can provide important context for existing case studies detailing the expanding - and often problematic - role of pharmaceuticals in society. To access the pharmaceutical industry's pipeline, we constructed a database of drugs for which pharmaceutical companies reported initiating clinical trials over a five-year period (July 2006-June 2011), capturing 2477 different drugs in 4182 clinical trials. Comparing drugs in the pipeline that target diseases in high-income and low-income countries, we found that the number of drugs for diseases prevalent in high-income countries was 3.46 times higher than drugs for diseases prevalent in low-income countries. We also found that the plurality of drugs in the pipeline was being developed to treat cancers (26.2%). Interpreting our findings through the lens of pharmaceuticalization, we illustrate how investigating the entire drug development pipeline provides important information about patterns of pharmaceuticalization that are invisible when only marketed drugs are considered. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Cancer; Clinical trials; Global burden of disease; HIV/AIDS; Mental illness; Pharmaceuticalization; Pharmaceuticals; R&D","Abraham, J., Pharmaceuticalization of society in context: theoretical, empirical and health dimensions (2010) Sociology, 44, pp. 603-622; Abraham, J., Davis, C., Acomparative analysis of drug safety withdrawals in the UK and the US (1971-1992): Implications for current regulatory thinking and policy (2005) Soc.

This research was conducted as part of the 2013 comprehensive needs assessment for the Northeast Georgia Ryan White Consortium using an anthropologically informed mixed-methods design, and a deductive-inductive approach to thematic analysis of qualitative data obtained in interviews and focus groups with service providers and service utilizers. Our comprehensive needs assessment yielded two key components. First, we identified salient phenomena influencing introduction to, retention among, and satisfaction of patients in the Ryan White-coordinated treatment cascade in NE-GA. Second, we formulated actionable recommendations around leverage points identified in the current district-wide system of care. Results highlight spatial, institutional, and interpersonal aspects of the system of care that intersect around issues of patient privacy, psychological health, and social stigma. These intersections constitute pathways by which persons living with HIV are exposed to stigma and other negative social signals regarding their health status without sufficient access to behavioral health services. These negative issues, in turn, can erect significant barriers to long-term continuity in care. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Barriers to care; HIV/AIDS; Leverage points; Mixed methods; Needs assessment; Patient privacy; Qualitative; Rural; Ryan white programs; Stigma","Adimora, A.A., Ramirez, C., Schoenbach, V.J., Cohen, M.S., Policies and politics that promote HIV infection in the Southern United States (2014) AIDS, 28, pp. 1393-1397; (2014) Bloomberg best (and worst): Most income inequality, , http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst/most-income-inequality-us-cities, Bloomberg Visual Data, U.S. Cities; (2012) New HIV infections in the United States, , CDC Publishing, Atlanta, GA; Cordova, W., Cooper, H.S., Avant, F., Factors that impact service delivery to individuals living with HIV/AIDS in rural northeaster Texas (2011) Contemporary Rural Social Work, 3, pp. 59-77; Deeks, S., Lewin, S., Havlir, D., The end of AIDS: HIV infection as a chronic disease (2013) Lancet, 382, pp. 1525-1533; Greene, K., Frey, L.R., Derlega, V.J., Interpersonalizing AIDS: Attending to the personal and social relationships of individuals living with HIV and/or AIDS (2002) Journal of Social & Personal Relationships, 19, p. 5; Grinsztejn, B., Luz, P.M., Pacheco, A.G., Santos, D.V.G., Velasque, L., Moreira, R.I., Changing mortality profile among HIV-infected patients in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: Shifting from AIDS to non-AIDS related conditions in the HAART era (2013) PLoS ONE, 8, pp. 1-9; Grzywacz, J.G., Fuqua, J., The social ecology of health: Leverage points and linkages (2000) Behavioral Medicine, 26, p. 101; (2013) Ryan White CARE Title II Manual, revised, , U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC; Heckman, B., Carlson, T., A randomized clinical trial of two telephone-delivered, mental health interventions for HIV-infected persons in rural areas of the United States (2007) AIDS and Behavior, 11 (1), pp. 5-14; Henry J.Kaiser Family, Foundation, (2013) HIV/AIDS policy: The Ryan White Program (Doc #7582-07), , Henry J.

Their roles in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) remains unclear. Methods: Adults with chronic treated HIV disease were recruited (n = 43, aged 56.7 ± 7.9; 32% aged 60+; median HIV duration 20 years, >95% plasma and CSF HIV RNA <50 cp/mL, on cART for a median 24 months). All underwent standard neuropsychological testing (61% had HAND), APOE genotyping (30.9% carried APOE ε4 and 7.1% were ε4 homozygotes) and a lumbar puncture. Concentrations of Aβ1-42, t-tau and p-tau were assessed in the CSF using commercial ELISAs. Current neurocognitive status was defined using the continuous Global Deficit Score, which grades impairment in clinically relevant categories. History of HAND was recorded. Univariate correlations informed multivariate models, which were corrected for nadir CD4-T cell counts and HIV duration. Results: Carriage of APOE ε4 predicted markedly lower levels of CSF Aβ1-42 in univariate (r = -.50; p = .001) and multivariate analyses (R2 = .25; p < .0003). Greater levels of neurocognitive impairment were associated with higher CSF levels of p-tau in univariate analyses (r = .32; p = .03) and multivariate analyses (R2 = .10; p = .03). AD risk prediction cut-offs incorporating all three CSF biomarkers suggested that 12.5% of participants had a high risk for AD. Having a CSF-AD like profile was more frequent in those with current (p = .05) and past HIV-associated dementia (p = .03). Conclusions: Similarly to larger studies, APOE ε4 genotype was not directly associated with HAND, but moderated CSF levels of Aβ1-42 in a minority of participants. In the majority of participants, increased CSF p-tau levels were associated with current neurocognitive impairment. Combined CSF biomarker risk for AD in the current HIV+ sample is more than 10 times greater than in the Australian population of the same age. Larger prospective studies are warranted. © Cysique et al.","APOE; Aβ1-42; CSF; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders; HIV/AIDS; p-tau; t-tau","Krut, J.J., Zetterberg, H., Blennow, K., Cinque, P., Hagberg, L., Price, R.W., Cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer's biomarker profiles in CNS infections (2013) J Neurol, 260 (2), pp. 620-626;

Lack of awareness regarding HIV and preventive practices against MTCT maybe one of the reasons behind high HIV transmission rates. In our study, we assessed the knowledge of HIV/AIDS in antenatal women, attending a tertiary care hospital in India as well as their attitude toward voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for HIV. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study carried out from May–July 2012 using a pretested interview-based questionnaire given to 386 antenatal women after obtaining consent. Data were abstracted for knowledge of HIV, MTCT, and attitude toward VCT. Results were expressed as percentages using SPSS v.16 software. Results: Amongst the respondents, 92.5 % had heard of HIV and in 41 % of them, the source of information was through mass media. 81 % were aware of sexual intercourse as a mode of transmission of HIV while 55 % knew that sharing sharp objects and infected blood products can spread HIV. 37.6 % of respondents were aware of MTCT and 44 % heard of antiretroviral therapy as a method of prevention of MTCT. While 68 % were willing to get tested for HIV, 18.9 % knew about the steps involved and 44 % knew where to get VCT. Conclusion: There exists a lack of adequate knowledge regarding HIV and preventive practices against MTCT. Health education and awareness campaigns on MTCT prevention and VCT promotion should target women in their antenatal period in order to increase acceptability and accessibility of these services. © 2014, Federation of Obstetric & Gynecological Societies of India.","Antiretroviral therapy; HIV/AIDS; Maternal to child transmission (MTCT); Testing (VCT); Voluntary counseling","http://data.unaids.org/pub/report/2008/india_2008_country_progress_report_en.pdf, UNGASS country Progress Report 2008: India.

Consensus among stakeholders is necessary to formulate clear national policies that maintain high-quality care. We sought to understand key stakeholders' opinions regarding task shifting of HIV care in Mozambique and to characterize which specific tasks stakeholders considered appropriate for specific cadres of health workers. Methods: National and provincial Ministry of Health leaders, representatives from donor and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and clinicians providing HIV care were intentionally selected to represent diverse viewpoints. Using open- and closed-ended questions, interviewees were asked about their general support of task shifting, its potential advantages and disadvantages, and whether each of seven cadres of non-physician health workers should perform each of eight tasks related to ART provision. Responses were tallied overall and stratified by current job category. Interviews were conducted between November 2007 and June 2008. Results: Of 62 stakeholders interviewed, 44% held leadership positions in the Ministry of Health, 44% were clinicians providing HIV care, and 13% were donors or employed by NGOs; 89% held a medical degree. Stakeholders were highly supportive of physician assistants performing simple ART-related tasks and unanimous in opposing community health workers providing any ART-related services. The most commonly cited motives to implement task shifting were to increase ART access, decrease physician workload, and decrease patient wait time, whereas chief concerns included reduced quality of care and poor training and supervision. Support for task shifting was higher among clinicians than policy and programme leaders for three specific task/cadre combinations: general mid-level nurses to initiate ART in adults (supported by 75% of clinicians vs. 41% of non-clinicians) and in pregnant women (75% vs. 34%, respectively) and physician assistants to change ART regimens in adults (43% vs. 24%, respectively). Conclusions: Stakeholders agreed on some ART-related task delegation to lower health worker cadres. Clinicians were more likely to support task shifting than policy and programme leaders, perhaps motivated by their front-line experiences. Harmonizing policy and programme managers' views with those of clinicians will be important to formulate and implement clear policy. © Rustagi et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Antiretroviral therapy; HIV/AIDS; Mozambique; Task shifting","Global Report: UNAIDS report on the global AIDS epidemic 2013 (2013), Geneva: UNAIDSWorking together for health: the World Health Report 2006 (2006), Geneva: World Health OrganizationSamb, B., Celletti, F., Holloway, J., Damme, W.V., Cock, K.M.D., Dybul, M., Rapid expansion of the health workforce in response to the HIV epidemic (2007) New Engl J Med, 357, pp. 2510-2514; Kredo, T., Adeniyi, F.B., Bateganya, M., Pienaar, E.D., Task shifting from doctors to non-doctors for initiation and maintenance of antiretroviral therapy (2014) Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 7, p.

In the present study of 225 HIV+ persons, we investigated the role of an incident depressive episode in changes in apathy. Participants completed the apathy subscale of the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale during a detailed neuropsychiatric and neuromedical evaluation at visit 1 and again at approximately a 14 month follow-up. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to obtain diagnoses of a new major depressive disorder. At their follow-up visit, participants were classified into four groups depending on their visit 1 elevation in apathy and new major depressive episode (MDE) status. Apathetic participants at baseline with a new MDE (n=23) were at risk for continued, clinically elevated apathy at follow-up, although severity of symptoms did not increase. Of the 144 participants without clinically elevated apathy at visit 1, those who developed a new MDE (n=16) had greater apathy symptomatology at follow-up than those without MDE. These findings suggest that HIV+ individuals, who do not as yet present with elevated apathy, may be at greater risk of elevated psychiatric distress should they experience a new/recurrent depressive episode. Thus, in the context of previous findings, it appears that although apathy and depression are separable constructs, they interact such that a new depressive episode is a risk factor for incident apathy. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","HIV/AIDS; Longitudinal study; Motivation; Neuropsychiatry","Atkinson, J.H., Heaton, R.K., Patterson, T.L., Wolfson, T., Deutsch, R., Brown, S.J., Grant, I., Two-year prospective study of major depressive disorder in HIV-infected men (2008) J.

The focus of analysis is a developing country where HIV/AIDS is acknowledged to have had a detrimental impact on its human resources. The objective of this research was to assess whether a voluntary, non-legally binding National Policy on HIV/AIDS is an adequate motivator for the adoption of HIV/AIDS policies in businesses. The study engaged employers and managers across a number of key sectors in Botswana. The findings are explored through a theoretical lens that acknowledges institutional isomorphism and rational economic decision-making as potential motivating factors. The data indicate that the National Policy on HIV/AIDS had motivated certain businesses to adopt such policies, but a variety of other factors were also found to be involved in this process. There was, however, lack of engagement with the National Policy and with issues surrounding HIV/AIDS by a high number of the participating organisations. The research findings reveal the complexity of factors involved in adopting HIV/AIDS policies in a developing country, and therefore provide an insight in an under-researched area. They can serve as a foundation for future research on human resource management policies and practices in relation to HIV/AIDS in African economies. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","AIDS; Botswana; HIV; human resource management (HRM)",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926140127

We present findings of a study that explored time-based trends of baseline characteristics among children enrolling into 26 public HIV care facilities in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methods: Children enrolled between October 2004 and September 2011 was included in these analyses. The year of enrollment was used as the primary predictor of interest, and log linear and linear regressions model were used to analyze dichotomous and continuous variables respectively. P-values under 0.05 were considered significant. Results: Among the 6,579 children enrolled, the proportion with advanced disease at enrollment increased from 35% to 58%, mean age increasing from 5.0 to 6.2years (p<0.0001), proportion of children less than 2years decreased from 35% to 29%. While the median hemoglobin concentration rose from 9.1g/dl to 10.3g/dl (P <0.0001), proportion with a history of past TB dropped from 25% to 12.8% (P<0.0001). Over time, health centers and dispensaries enrolled more children as compared to hospitals (P<0.0001). Temeke district, which has the lowest socioeconomic status among the three districts in Dar es Salaam, had a significant increase in enrollment from 22% to 25% (P=0.02). Conclusion: We found that as time progressed, children were enrolled in care and treatment services at an older age sicker status as evidenced by increase in mean age and more advanced disease stage at first contact with providers. We recommend more efforts be focused on scaling up early HIV infant diagnosis and enrollment to HIV care and treatment. © Sando et al.","AIDS; HIV; Pediatric","(2012) UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic, , http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/20121120_UNAIDS_Global_Report_2012_with_annexes_en_1.pdf; (2010) Towards Universal Access: Scaling up priority HIV/AIDS interventions in health sector, , http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/2010progressreport/en/; (2012) National Guidelines for Management of HIV and AIDS, , 3rd ed.

Although increased longevity brings new hope, it also raises unanticipated challenges—especially for gay men who never thought they would live into middle and older age. Middle-aged and older people are more likely to face multiple comorbidities, yet many lack the necessary supports to help them adapt to the challenges of aging with HIV. This article presents the findings of a qualitative study developed to explore gay men’s experience of aging with HIV. Multiple in-depth exploratory interviews were conducted with 15 gay-identified men living with HIV/AIDS over an 18-month period. A systematic strategy data analysis consistent with grounded theory revealed a pattern of subtle adjustments to living with HIV that resulted in diminishing circles of social support and social involvement. This dynamic is referred to as “a shrinking kind of life,” an in-vivo code built from the participant’s own words. Four themes from the research (physical challenges, a magnitude of loss, internal changes, & stigma) are discussed. Conclusions include recommendations for future research and implications for practice in the field. Practitioners knowledgeable of the factors that impact their social involvement can empower gay men through individual and group interventions to confront a shrinking kind of life and define for themselves what it means to optimally age with HIV. © 2015, Routledge.

This study assessed explicit and implicit forms of social support and mental health symptoms in 120 HIV-positive Chinese. Explicit social support refers to interactions involving active disclosure and discussion of problems and request for assistance, whereas implicit social support refers to the emotional comfort one obtains from social networks without disclosing problems. We hypothesized and found using multiple linear regression, that after controlling for demographics, only implicit, but not explicit social support positively predicted mental health. Future research is warranted on the effects of utilizing implicit social support to bolster mental health, which has the potential to circumvent the issues of both high stigma and low professional resources in this population. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","China; Depression; HIV/AIDS; Mental health; Social support",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925431446

The theory of planned behaviour suggests that behaviour is influenced by attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control and not by knowledge. However, a large body of knowledge argues that increased HIV/AIDS-related knowledge leads to the adoption of safe behavioural practices. The purpose of this non-experimental survey study, therefore, was to investigate the correlation between academic HIV/AIDS knowledge, functional HIV/AIDS knowledge and self-reported behavioural preferences of 300 biology and 243 non-biology students from nine South African schools. Results suggest a correlation between students’ understanding of academic and functional HIV/AIDS knowledge. The behavioural preferences of both biology and non-biology students were generally the same and safe. Among biology students, correlation was observed between academic HIV/AIDS knowledge and self-reported safe behavioural preferences, which was not the case for non-biology students, where functional HIV/AIDS knowledge correlated with self-reported safe behavioural preferences. Within schools, however, no correlation was found between both forms of HIV/AIDS knowledge and self-reported safe behavioural preferences. There were indications that context-specific local factors have a greater influence on behavioural preferences. These findings suggest that the type of knowledge that could influence behaviour is informed by context-specific dynamics. © 2015 Society of Biology","Correlation; Generic HIV/AIDS knowledge; Scientific HIV/AIDS knowledge; Theory of planned behaviour",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925425738

For this to be a valid process, the information needs to be presented in a manner that promotes adolescent comprehension. Previous studies suggest that adolescent comprehension of assent is often insufficient. We developed an interactive web-based assent that included interspersed quiz questions for a hypothetical HIV vaccine trial. Efficacy of the web-based assent was compared to a standard paper assent with and without interspersed questions. One hundred twenty teen participants, ages 15–17 years, from five community organizations were randomized to self-administered web-based assent (n = 60) or investigator-administered paper assent with (n = 29) or without (n = 31) interspersed quiz questions. After reviewing the assent, participants completed a 27-item comprehension test. Comprehension scores were compared between groups. The mean number of correctly answered questions were 21.2 for the full paper group and 21.1 for the web-based group (t118 = –0.08, p = 0.94). Scores were 20.2 for the paper without interspersed questions sub-group and 22.1 for the paper with interspersed questions sub-group (t58 = 1.96, p = 0.055). Participants in the web-based group performed as well on the comprehension test as those in the paper group, and those in the paper with questions sub-group performed better than those in the paper without questions sub-group, suggesting that interspersed quiz questions may improve understanding of a traditional paper assent. The minimal investigator time and standardized administration of the web-based assent as well as ability to tailor the assent discussion to topics identified by incorrect comprehension test responses are advantages worthy of further investigation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","adolescence; clinical trials; computer-assisted instruction; HIV infection and AIDS; informed consent; research ethics",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925438512

This type of research is important because it not only reflects a growing and diversifying consumer demand for male sex work, but also because it enables the construction of knowledge that is up-to-date with changing ideas around sex and sexualities. Discussion: This paper discusses a range of issues emerging in the male sex industry. Notably, globalisation and technology have contributed to the normalisation of male sex work and reshaped the landscape in which the male sex industry operates. As part of this discussion, we review STI and HIV rates among male sex workers at a global level, which are widely disparate and geographically contextual, with rates of HIV among male sex workers ranging from 0% in some areas to 50% in others. The Internet has reshaped the way that male sex workers and clients connect and has been identified as a useful space for safer sex messages and research that seeks out hidden or commonly excluded populations. Future directions: We argue for a public health context that recognises the emerging and changing nature of male sex work, which means programs and policies that are appropriate for this population group. Online communities relating to male sex work are important avenues for safer sexual messages and unique opportunities to reach often excluded sub-populations of both clients and male sex workers. The changing structure and organisation of male sex work alongside rapidly changing cultural, academic and medical discourses provide new insight but also new challenges to how we conceive the sexualities of men and male sex workers. Public health initiatives must reflect upon and incorporate this knowledge. © 2015 Minichiello et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","e-technologies; HIV/AIDS; Male sex industry; Male sex worker; Sexualities",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928735190

This article seeks to explore the role of constructions of masculinity in men's drinking and sexual risk behavior in drinking venues (bars and taverns) in 2 rural villages of North West Province, South Africa. Ten focus groups were conducted with 58 bar patrons and servers. Four focus groups consisted of female bar patrons, 4 consisted of male bar patrons, and 2 consisted of male bar managers and servers. The participants' ages ranged from 18 to 43 years, and they were interviewed using focus group discussion guides with open-ended questions. Key themes identified through thematic analysis were (a) men's high levels of alcohol consumption, (b) men's tendency to blame women for men's proneness to risky sex when drinking, © men's sexual objectification of women, and (d) the far-reaching consequences of sexism and violence perpetrated by men. Policies to promote gender equality are needed to ensure that men are more gender-sensitive, engage in more balanced gender relationships, and do not uphold any destructive gender stereotypes.

The research objectives for this study were to explore and describe how HIV stigma and disclosure experiences impact the lives of PLWH and to explore whether there are differences between experiences in urban and rural settings. A qualitative approach was followed and participants were selected through purposive voluntary sampling. Data collection took place using in-depth interviews with 23 PLWH, 11 of whom resided in an urban setting in North-West, South Africa, and 12 resided in a rural setting in the same province. The data were manually analysed through open coding. The HIV stigma experiences expressed by PLWH depicted negative behavioural patterns and attitudes towards them, fear from the community of being infected by PLWH and lastly negative self-judgement by PLWH themselves. During disclosure, PLWH were unsure and they described it as a stressful event. They cautiously considered to whom to disclose their condition and what benefits disclosure will hold. They further had to handle forced disclosure due to being identifiable in health-care settings. HIV stigma and related disclosure practices remained a problem, which detrimentally affected treatment and support efforts. Recommendations focused on HIV stigma reduction in the community that needed to involve PLWH and PLC. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","AIDS; disclosure; HIV; rural; stigma; urban",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925250277

In this social environment, extensive efforts are thus required to increase HIV/AIDS knowledge, reduce stigma, stimulate HIV testing, improve health care-seeking behavior, and encourage safe sexual practices—described in the literature as the need for AIDS competence. In accordance with socio-ecological theory, one cannot restrict the research focus to communities, as AIDS competence studies should also incorporate the intermediate household level. In responding to this research need, the aim of this article is to conceptualize an “HIV/AIDS competent household” based on qualitative interviews and focus group discussions conducted in a township on the outskirts of Cape Town, South Africa. Our results show that a household’s supportive response to disclosure allows a patient to live openly as HIV positive in the household concerned. This may mark the start of the road to HIV/AIDS competence in the household, meaning the PLWHA receives sustainable support throughout the care continuum and positive living becomes the norm for the PLWHA and his or her household. A feedback loop might also be created in which other household members are encouraged to be tested and to disclose their status, which is an important step towards a sustainable response to HIV/AIDS-related challenges. Despite the fact that this road to HIV/AIDS competence at the household level is fragile and prone to various barriers, this article shows that the household has the potential to be a health-enabling environment for PLWHA. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Care continuum; Health-enabling environment; HIV/AIDS; HIV/AIDS competence; HIV/AIDS competent household; Household support; South Africa; Treatment adherence","Karim, S.S.A., Stigma impedes AIDS prevention (2011) Nature, 474, pp. 29-31; Gardner, E.M., Young, B., The HIV care cascade through time (2014) Lancet Infect.

Insight in the predictors or correlates of poor HRQoL may be helpful to identify patients most in need of additional support and to design appropriate interventions. A cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2012 and April 2013 in 10 healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Patients who were at least 6 months on cART were randomly selected and individual patient data were retrieved from medical records. HRQoL was measured by the WHOQoL-HIVBREF, depressive-symptoms by the Kessler-6 scale, and stigma by the Kalichman internalized AIDS-related stigma scale. Multivariate linear regression analysis was carried-out to examine associations between HRQoL and the other variables. A total of 664 patients (response-rate 95%) participated in the study. A higher level of depressive-symptoms was most strongly and consistently associated with a lower HRQoL, both in terms of the magnitude of the relationship and in the number of HRQoL domains associated with it. Also, a higher level of HIV-stigma was associated with a lower HRQoL except for the physical domain, while obtaining sufficient nutritious food and job opportunity were associated with a better HRQoL except for the spiritual and social domains, respectively. Demographics, clinical, and treatment characteristics yielded few significant associations with HRQoL. Our study findings suggest that interventions to improve HRQoL should focus on reducing depressive-symptoms and HIV-stigma, and on enhancing food security and job opportunity. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","cART; health-related quality of life; HIV/AIDS; predictor; quality of life; resource-limited setting",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925278058

Although groups M and N have been traced to geographically distinct chimpanzee communities in southern Cameroon, the reservoirs of groups O and P remain unknown. Here,we screened fecal samples from western lowland (n = 2,611), eastern lowland (n = 103), and mountain (n = 218) gorillas for gorilla SIV (SIVgor) antibodies and nucleic acids. Despite testing wild troops throughout southern Cameroon (n = 14), northern Gabon (n = 16), the Democratic Republic of Congo (n = 2), and Uganda (n = 1), SIVgor was identified at only four sites in southern Cameroon, with prevalences ranging from 0.8-22%. Amplification of partial and full-length SIVgor sequences revealed extensive genetic diversity, but all SIVgor strains were derived from a single lineage within the chimpanzee SIV (SIVcpz) radiation. Two fully sequenced gorilla viruses from southwestern Cameroon were very closely related to, and likely represent the source population of, HIV-1 group P. Most of the genome of a third SIVgor strain, from central Cameroon, was very closely related to HIV-1 group O, again pointing to gorillas as the immediate source. Functional analyses identified the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G as a barrier for chimpanzee-to-gorilla, but not gorilla-to-human, virus transmission. These data indicate that HIV-1 group O, which spreads epidemically in west central Africa and is estimated to have infected around 100,000 people, originated by cross-species transmission from western lowland gorillas.","AIDS; Gorilla; HIV-1; SIVgor; Zoonotic transmission","Sharp, P.M., Hahn, B.H., Origins of HIV and the AIDS pandemic (2011) Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med, 1 (1); Locatelli, S., Peeters, M., Cross-species transmission of simian retroviruses: How and why they could lead to the emergence of new diseases in the human population (2012) AIDS, 26 (6), pp. 659-673; Bailes, E., Hybrid origin of SIV in chimpanzees (2003) Science, 300 (5626), p. 1713; Keele, B.F., Chimpanzee reservoirs of pandemic and nonpandemic HIV-1 (2006) Science, 313 (5786), pp. 523-526; Van Heuverswyn, F., Genetic diversity and phylogeographic clustering of SIVcpzPtt in wild chimpanzees in Cameroon (2007) Virology, 368 (1), pp. 155-171; Li, Y., Eastern chimpanzees, but not bonobos, represent a simian immunodeficiency virus reservoir (2012) J Virol, 86 (19), pp. 10776-10791; Santiago, M.L., SIVcpz in wild chimpanzees (2002) Science, 295 (5554), p. 465; Switzer, W.M., The epidemiology of simian immunodeficiency virus infection in a large number of wild- and captive-born chimpanzees: Evidence for a recent introduction following chimpanzee divergence (2005) AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses, 21 (5), pp. 335-342; Van Heuverswyn, F., Human immunodeficiency viruses: SIV infection in wild gorillas (2006) Nature, 444 (7116), p. 164; Delaugerre, C., De Oliveira, F., Lascoux-Combe, C., Plantier, J.C., Simon, F., HIV-1 group N: Travelling beyond Cameroon (2011) Lancet, 378 (9806), p. 1894; Plantier, J.-C., A new human immunodeficiency virus derived from gorillas (2009) Nat Med, 15 (8), pp. 871-872; Vallari, A., Confirmation of putative HIV-1 group P in Cameroon (2011) J Virol, 85 (3), pp. 1403-1407; Peeters, M., Geographical distribution of HIV-1 group O viruses in Africa (1997) AIDS, 11 (4), pp. 493-498; Kluge, S.F., Nef proteins of epidemic HIV-1 group O strains antagonize human tetherin (2014) Cell Host Microbe, 16 (5), pp. 639-650; Takehisa, J., Origin and biology of simian immunodeficiency virus in wildliving western gorillas (2009) J Virol, 83 (4), pp. 1635-1648; Neel, C., Molecular epidemiology of simian immunodeficiency virus infection in wild-living gorillas (2010) J Virol, 84 (3), pp. 1464-1476; Etienne, L., Noninvasive follow-up of simian immunodeficiency virus infection in wild-living nonhabituated western lowland gorillas in Cameroon (2012) J Virol, 86 (18), pp. 9760-9772; Etienne, L., Single real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay for detection and quantification of genetically diverse HIV-1, SIVcpz, and SIVgor strains (2013) J Clin Microbiol, 51 (3), pp. 787-798; Letko, M., Vif proteins from diverse primate lentiviral lineages use the same binding site in APOBEC3G (2013) J Virol, 87 (21), pp. 11861-11871; Prado-Martinez, J., Great ape genetic diversity and population history (2013) Nature, 499 (7459), pp. 471-475; Butynski, T.M., (2001) Great Apes and Humans: The Ethics of Coexistence, , eds Beck BB, et al.

This study aimed to: determine clusters of patients with similar symptom combinations; describe symptom combinations distinguishing the clusters; and evaluate the clusters regarding patient socio-demographic, disease and treatment characteristics, quality of life (QOL) and functional performance. This was a cross-sectional study of 302 adult HIV/AIDS outpatients consecutively recruited at two teaching and referral hospitals in Uganda. Socio-demographic and seven-day period symptom prevalence and distress data were self-reported using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Schedule. QOL was assessed using the Medical Outcome Scale and functional performance using the Karnofsky Performance Scale. Symptom clusters were established using hierarchical cluster analysis with squared Euclidean distances using Ward’s clustering methods based on symptom occurrence. Analysis of variance compared clusters on mean QOL and functional performance scores. Patient subgroups were categorised based on symptom occurrence rates. Five symptom occurrence clusters were identified: Cluster 1 (n = 107), high–low for sensory discomfort and eating difficulties symptoms; Cluster 2 (n = 47), high–low for psycho-gastrointestinal symptoms; Cluster 3 (n = 71), high for pain and sensory disturbance symptoms; Cluster 4 (n = 35), all high for general HIV/AIDS symptoms; and Cluster 5 (n = 48), all low for mood-cognitive symptoms. The all high occurrence cluster was associated with worst functional status, poorest QOL scores and highest symptom-associated distress. Use of antiretroviral therapy was associated with all high symptom occurrence rate (Fisher’s exact = 4, P < 0.001). CD4 count group below 200 was associated with the all high occurrence rate symptom cluster (Fisher’s exact = 41, P < 0.001). Symptom clusters have a differential, affect HIV/AIDS patients’ self-reported outcomes, with the subgroup experiencing high-symptom occurrence rates having a higher risk of poorer outcomes. Identification of symptom clusters could provide insights into commonly co-occurring symptoms that should be jointly targeted for management in patients with multiple complaints. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","Africa; ambulatory HIV/AIDS patients; symptom clusters",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925264407

Given the deficit of reviews addressing social and behavioural characteristics of HIV-serodiscordant couples within high-income settings, our objective was to understand the scope of the published literature, identify evidence gaps, and suggest future research needs. Methods: Ten electronic databases were searched. Studies were included if they were reported in English, used primary data, were from the combination antiretroviral (cART) era (>1996), reported on social or behavioural aspects, included any fraction of primary (i.e., stable) relationships, and were conducted in high-income settings. Studies that identified their unit of analysis as either the dyad or individual member of the couple were included. Studies were coded according to a thematic framework. Results: Included studies (n = 154) clustered into eight themes: risk behaviours (29%), risk management (26%), reproductive issues (12%), relationship quality (9%), serostatus disclosure (7%), adherence to antiretroviral therapy (7%), vulnerability (5%), and social support (3%). The proportion of studies conducted among heterosexual couples, same-sex male couples, and mixed cohorts were 42%, 34%, and 24%, respectively. Most studies (70%) were conducted in the United States, 70% of all studies were quantitative (including interventions), but only one-third were focused on couples (dyads) where both partners are recruited to a study. Over 25% of studies focused on sexual risk among same-sex male couples. Conclusions: Future research efforts should focus on the interrelationship of risk management strategies and relationship quality, social determinants of health and wellbeing, HIV testing, vulnerable populations, reproductive issues among same-sex couples, disclosure of serodiscordant status to social networks, dyadic studies, population-based studies, and interventions to support risk management within couples. Additional population-based studies and studies among marginalized groups would be helpful for targeting research and interventions to couples that are most in need. As HIV-positive partners are typically the link to services and research, innovative ways are needed for reaching out to HIV-negative partners. Our review suggests that significantly more research is needed to understand the social and behavioural contexts of HIV-serodiscordant relationships. © 2015 Mendelsohn et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","AIDS; Behavioural; High-income settings; HIV; Relationships; Review; Serodiscordant; Social",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928230289

These regions were the Estuaire Province (Libreville and its neighborhood) and the Haut-Ogooué Province (Franceville and its neighborhood). The opportunistic diseases and symptomatic conditions considered during this study were: diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, cough, tuberculosis, abscesses, stomach ache, skin rashes, venereal diseases, typhoid fever, anemia, general tiredness, hepatitis and vomiting. Materials and methods: The reported species were evaluated through three parameters: specificity, reliability and frequency. Plant parts of relevant species were harvested and extracted with an aqueous alcohol solution (ethanol/water: 1/1). The extracts obtained were submitted to phytochemical screening and in vitro microbiological assays on some clinical isolates and ATCC strains, involved in HIV/AIDS opportunistic diseases through the Agar well diffusion and Microbroth dilution methods. Results: Among the 52 species identified during this survey, Coelocaryon klainei Pierre ex Heckel (Myristicaceae), Dacryodes klaineana (Pierre) H.J. Lam (Bursecaceae), Phyllanthus diandrus Pax (Euphorbiaceae), Saccoglotys gabonensis (Baill.) Urb. (Humiriaceae) and Tetrorchidium didymostemon (Baill.) Pax & K. Hoffm. (Euphorbiaceae) were submitted to in vitro microbiological assays. Phyllanthus diandrus bark and leaves show best antibacterial activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae with MIC value of 0.25 respectively. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence in all the plant parts extracts of potentially bioactive molecules, including polyphenols, especially flavonoids and tannins. Conclusion: It is concluded that some of these plants might be submitted to further scientific studies, including the identification and isolation of bioactive principles, that could be developed to drugs for the treatment of HIV/AIDS opportunistic diseases. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim of the current study is to inform the development of a stigma reduction intervention in the context of a large multicomponent trial. We analysed relevant results of four feasibility studies conducted in the lead up to the trial. Our findings suggest that a stigma reduction campaign must address community and structural level drivers of stigma, in addition to individual level concerns, through a participatory and iterative approach. Importantly, stigma reduction must not only be embedded in the institutional management of HCWs but also be attentive to the localised needs of HCWs themselves. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","health care workers; HIV/AIDS; stigma reduction; tuberculosis; workplace interventions",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924690010

Thus, as a result of high levels of food insecurity many HIV patients are also undernourished. The synergism between HIV and undernutrition leads to poor treatment adherence and high mortality rates. Undernutrition has a debilitating effect on the immune system due to key nutrient deficiencies and the overproduction of reactive species (oxidative stress), which causes rapid HIV progression and the onset of AIDS. Therapeutic food supplementation used in the treatment of severe acute malnutrition is being applied to HIV palliative care; however, little biochemical data exist to highlight its impact on oxidative stress and immune recovery. In addition, as most food supplements are imported by donor agencies, efforts are being put into local therapeutic food production such as the Food Multi-Mix concept to ensure sustainability. The purpose of this review is to highlight studies that examine the effectiveness of food supplementation in undernourished HIV patients in Sub-Saharan Africa; noting the parameters used to measure efficacy, as well as the long-term feasibility of supplementation.

Thus, infection rebounds when treatment is interrupted by reactivation of virus production from this reservoir. Currently, one or a few latently infected resting memory CD4 T cells are thought be the principal source of recrudescent infection, but this estimate is based on peripheral blood rather than lymphoid tissues (LTs), the principal sites of virus production and persistence before initiating ART. We, therefore, examined lymph node (LN) and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) biopsies from fully suppressed subjects, interrupted therapy, monitored plasma viral load (pVL), and repeated biopsies on 12 individuals as soon as pVL became detectable. Isolated HIV RNApositive (vRNA+) cells were detected by in situ hybridization in LTs obtained before interruption in several patients. After interruption, multiple foci of vRNA+ cells were detected in 6 of 12 individuals as soon as pVL was measureable and in some subjects, in more than one anatomic site. Minimal estimates of the number of rebounding/founder (R/F) variants were determined by singlegene amplification and sequencing of viral RNA or DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma obtained at or just before viral recrudescence. Sequence analysis revealed a large number of R/F viruses representing recrudescent viremia from multiple sources. Together, these findings are consistent with the origins of recrudescent infection by reactivation from many latently infected cells at multiple sites. The inferred large pool of cells and sites to rekindle recrudescent infection highlights the challenges in eradicating HIV.","Founder population; HIV/AIDS; Treatment interruption; Viral recrudescence","Chun, T.W., Quantification of latent tissue reservoirs and total body viral load in HIV-1 infection (1997) Nature, 387 (6629), pp. 183-188;

There are hypotheses and study reports on the possible association between these two infections, hence the prevalence and outcome of their co-infection in an endemic population will be important in defining healthcare strategies. A cross sectional study was carried out at the Holy Family Hospital in Techiman, Ghana, between November 2011 and January 2012, to determine the prevalence of malaria among HIV sero-positive patients and its impact on hemoglobin levels. Method: A total of 400 HIV sero-positive participants (292 females and 108 males) aged between 1 and 73 years were randomly sampled for the study. A questionnaire was administered and 2 ml of venous blood samples were drawn for malaria parasites detection, CD4 count and haemoglobin level estimations. Results: Malaria parasites were detected in 47 (11.75%) of the participants. There was no statistically significant difference between the malaria prevalence rate of females (12.1%) and males (10.2%) P = 0.6047. An overall anaemia prevalence of 67% was observed. Among participants with malaria the anaemia prevalence was 93.6%. The CD4 cell count of all the participants ranged between 3 and 1604 cells/μl with a mean of 386.2 (±274.3) cells/μl. Participants with malaria had CD4 cell count ranged 3 and 512 Cells/μl with the mean being 186.33 (±133.49) Cells/μl. Out of 377 participants (all above 15 years) interviewed on knowledge of malaria transmission and prevention, 87.0% had knowledge on transmission but only 8.5% use in bed nets. Conclusion: It was revealed that almost all the patients with malaria infection were anemic. © Tay et al.","Anaemia; Anti-retroviral; CD4 cells; HIV/AIDS; Malaria co-infection","Asante, P.K., Zandoh, C., Dery, D.B., Brown, C., Adjei, G., Antwi-Dadzie, Y., 'Malaria epidemiology in the Ahafo area of Ghana' (2011) Malar J, 10, p. 211; Palella, F.J., Delaney, K.M., Moorman, A.C., Loveless, M.O., Fuhrer, J., Satten, G.A., Declining morbidity and mortality among patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection (1998) N Engl J Med, 338 (13), pp. 853-860; Frontiera, M., Myers, A.M., 'Peripheral blood and bone marrow abnormalities in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome' (1987) West J Med, 147, p. 157; Huff, B., HIV and malaria: Two intertwining epidemics' (2000) Am Found Aids Res, 6, pp. 1-5; (2012) World Malaria Report, , Geneva: WHO; Badu, K., Brenya, R.C., Timmann, C., Garms, R., Kruppa, T.F., Malaria transmission intensity and dynamics of clinical malaria incidence in a mountainous forest region of Ghana (2013) MWJ, 4, p. 14; Murphy, S.C., Breman, J.G., Gaps in the childhood malaria burden in Africa: cerebral malaria, neurological sequelae, anemia, respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, and complications of pregnancy (2001) Am J Trop Med Hyg, 64, pp. 57-67; (2006) Annual Report of the Ghana National Malaria Control Programme, , Ghana: Ghana Health Service; UNAIDS World AIDS Day report 2012 Regional fact sheets 2012, , http://www.unaids.org/enresources/campaigns/20121120_globalreport2012/factsheet/; Sentinel Survey Report H.I.V.

Our study objective was to explore provider-level factors that serve as barriers and/or facilitators to the provision of reproductive and safer conception services for men and women living with HIV. Methods: Twenty-five providers were interviewed in four focus group discussions about their attitudes regarding childbearing by HIV-infected clients, reproductive health and HIV knowledge, and views and knowledge of safer conception. Results: Providers reported ambivalence about supporting childbearing among their clients with HIV. They raised concerns about HIV-infected individuals having children, and in certain cases expressed judgment that people with HIV should not have children because of these concerns. Providers lack specific knowledge about safer conception strategies and have low level of knowledge of reproductive health, the efficacy of PMTCT, and the risks of pregnancy for HIV-infected women. Conclusions: Providers in our setting have complex attitudes about HIV-infected clients having children and lack knowledge to appropriately counsel clients about reproductive health and safer conception. Our findings highlight need for further research in this area as well as the need for provider training in reproductive health and safer conception. © 2015 Kawale et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Fertility desires; HIV/AIDS; Reproductive health; Safer conception",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928731224

Though both are the most prevalent systemic mycoses in HIV-infected patients, simultaneous infection by both the pathogens rarely occurs. We document the first case from Asian subcontinent with concurrent infection with disseminated cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis infections in a HIV-infected Indian patient diagnosed by morphological examination of fine-needle aspiration cytology samples obtained from the enlarged lymph nodes on light microscopy and were later confirmed by culture studies. A prompt, accurate and timely diagnosis of the disseminated form of dual mycosis (or either of the mycosis as well) is of utmost importance which has obvious impact on early initiation of treatment. Fine-needle aspiration cytology is a rapid, cost-effective and reliable method to identify infection with Cryptococcus and Histoplasma and is comparable with the essential culture studies. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","AIDS; Co-infection; Cryptococcosis; Histoplasmosis; HIV",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924258762

These molecules have been evaluated for their in vitro inhibitory effects against a wide panel of viruses showing preferential activity against HIV and HCV. Our structure-activity relationship studies demonstrated that the 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzoyl moiety provides better antiviral activities than the galloyl (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoyl) moiety that is present in natural green tea catechins. This observation can be of interest for the further rational exploration of compounds with anti-HCV/HIV properties. The most notable finding with respect to HIV is that the tripodal compounds 43 and 45, with three 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzoyl moieties, showed higher activities than linear compounds with only one or two. With respect to HCV, the linear compounds, 52 and 41, containing a 12 polymethylene chain and two 2,3 di- or 2,3,4 tri-hydroxybenzoyl groups respectively at the ends of the molecule showed good antiviral efficiency. Furthermore, the anti-HCV activity of both compounds was observed at concentrations well below the cytotoxicity threshold. A representative member of these compounds, 41, showed that the anti-HCV activity was largely independent of the genetic make-up of the HCV subgenomic replicon and cell lines used. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.","AIDS; Antiviral agents; HCV; HIV; Polyphenols","Saito, I., Miyamura, T., Obayashi, A., Harada, H., Katayama, T., Kikuchi, S., Watanabe, Y., Kuo, G., Hepatitis C virus infection is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (1990) Proc.

The purpose of this study was to test explanatory models of how patient–provider interaction and patient satisfaction are related to medication adherence and HRQOL for PLWH. A total of 344 PLWH receiving health-care services from a federally funded clinic in the southwest USA completed a survey questionnaire about their perception of interactions with providers, their satisfaction with services, their medication adherence, and their HRQOL. Comparing four latent variable structural equation models of direct and mediated effects of patient–provider interaction and patient satisfaction, the findings illustrate that the best model is one in which patient–provider interaction has a direct and positive effect on patient satisfaction, medication adherence, and HRQOL. These findings suggest that quality patient–provider interaction is a critical element of health-care services for PLWH, while patient satisfaction is an outcome measure and not a mediating factor for medication adherence and HRQOL. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","health-related quality of life; medication adherence; patient satisfaction; patient–provider interaction; people living with HIV/AIDs",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924109499

Individuals living with HIV and a concurrent diagnosis of PTSD have poorer HIV-related outcomes; however, the prevalence and impact of PTSD on African-American WLHIV seeking mental health treatment is unknown. The aim of this study is to examine the associations between PTSD symptoms with psychiatric symptom severity and psychological/religious coping strategies in African-American WLHIV who are seeking mental health treatment. This is a cross-sectional study of 235 African-American WLHIV attending an urban community mental health clinic. Bivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between a PTSD symptoms scale (PSS ≥ 21 versus PSS < 21) and (1) psychiatric severity, (2) coping strategies, and (3) religious coping strategies. Thirty-six percent reported symptoms consistent with PTSD (PSS ≥ 21). These women were significantly more likely to have worse mental health symptoms and were more likely to employ negative psychological and religious coping strategies. On the contrary, women with a PSS < 21 reported relatively low levels of mental health symptoms and were more likely to rely on positive psychological and religious coping strategies. Over one-third of African-American WLHIV attending an outpatient mental health clinic had symptoms associated with PTSD. These symptoms were associated with worse mental health symptoms and utilization of dysfunctional religious and nonreligious coping strategies. Untreated PTSD in WLHIV predicts poorer HIV-related health outcomes and may negatively impact comorbid mental health outcomes. Screening for PTSD in WLHIV could identify a subset that would benefit from evidence-based PTSD-specific therapies in addition to mental health interventions already in place. PTSD-specific interventions for WLHIV with PTSD may improve outcomes, improve coping strategies, and allow for more effective treatment of comorbid mental health disorders. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","African-American; AIDS; coping; HIV; mental health; screening; trauma",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924311295

South Africa has the largest antiretroviral treatment (ART) programme in the world, with an estimated 2.7 million people on ART, elevating South Africa's prominence as a global leader in HIV treatment. In 2011, the Southern African HIV Clinicians Society published safer conception guidelines for people living with HIV (PLWH) and in 2013, the South African government published contraceptive guidelines highlighting the importance of SRH and fertility planning services for people living with HIV. Addressing unintended pregnancies, safer conception and maternal health issues is crucial for improving PLWH's SRH and combatting the global HIV epidemic. This paper explores South African policymakers' perspectives on public sector SRH-HIV policy integration, with a special focus on the need for national and regional policies on safer conception for PLWH and contraceptive guidelines implementation. Methods: It draws on 42 in-depth interviews with national, provincial and civil society policymakers conducted between 2008-2009 and 2011-2012, as the number of people on ART escalated. Interviews focused on three key domains: opinions on PLWH's childbearing; the status of SRH-HIV integration policies and services; and thoughts and suggestions on SRH-HIV integration within the restructuring of South African primary care services. Data were coded and analysed according to themes. Results: Participants supported SRH-HIV integrated policy and services. However, integration challenges identified included a lack of policy and guidelines, inadequately trained providers, vertical programming, provider work overload, and a weak health system. Participants acknowledged that SRH-HIV integration policies, particularly for safer conception, contraception and cervical cancer, had been neglected. Policymakers supported public sector adoption of safer conception policy and services. Participants interviewed after expanded ART were more positive about safer conception policies for PLWH than participants interviewed earlier. Conclusion: The past decade's HIV policy changes have increased opportunities for SRH-HIV integration. The findings provide important insights for international, regional and national SRH-HIV policy and service integration initiatives. © 2015 Cooper et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","HIV/AIDS; Integration; Policymakers; Resourced-constrained settings; Sexual and reproductive health; South Africa","Collins, P.Y., Holman, A.R., Freeman, M., Patel, V., What is the relevance of mental health to HIV/AIDS care and treatment programmes in developing countries?

Depression impacts negatively upon adherence and response to combined antiretroviral therapy (CART) and the transmission of HIV infection through increased sexually risky behavior. This cross-sectional study presents data from a reference HIV-outpatient service in Dourados (Brazil) that evaluated the association between depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life, and clinical, socioeconomic, and demographic factors in newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS patients. Using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 61% with a predominance of self-deprecating and cognitive-affective factors. Depressive symptoms were associated with lower income (p = 0.019) and disadvantaged social class (p = 0.005). Poorer quality of life was related to depressive symptoms (p < 0.0001), low educational level (p = 0.05), and lower income (p = 0.03). These data suggest that socioeconomic factors, including level of income and education, are mediating the risk of depression and poor quality of life of PLHIV.

One hundred older HIV+ adults completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, a neurocognitive battery, and IADL scale. Higher levels of moderate PA were associated with lower odds of NCI (p = 0.01), even when covariates were modeled. The association between moderate PA and NCI was driven by executive function (p = 0.04). Higher levels of moderate PA were also associated with lower odds of IADL Dependence (p = 0.03), although this fell to a trend (p = 0.08) when including covariates. Follow-up analysis showed those with both NCI and IADL Dependence had lower moderate PA than those with neither (p = 0.03).

Current metrics are reviewed, measures informed by global guidelines are suggested and areas for further clarification are underscored. Discussion: Questions remain on how best to evaluate late entry into each stage of the cascade. The delayed uptake of HIV testing may be more consistently measured once rapid CD4 testing is administered at the time of HIV testing. For late enrolment, preliminary research has begun to determine how different time intervals for linking to HIV care affect individual health. Regarding treatment, since 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS recommend treatment initiation when CD4 <500 cells/mm3; these guidelines provide a useful albeit evolving threshold to define late treatment initiation. Finally, WHO guidelines for high-, low-and middle-income countries also could be used to standardize measures for achieving viral suppression. Conclusions: There is no ""one size fits all"" model as the provision of services may differ based on a range of factors. Nonetheless, measures informed by global guidelines are needed to more consistently evaluate the scope of and factors associated with delays to each stage of the cascade. Doing so will help identify how practitioners can best deliver services and facilitate access to and continued engagement in care. © 2015 MacCarthy S et al; licensee International AIDS Society.","Care cascade; Continuum of care; HIV/AIDS; Linkage to care; Measures; Testing; Treatment cascade; Viral suppression","Gardner, E.M., McLees, M.P., Steiner, J.F., Del Rio, C., Burman, W.J., The spectrum of engagement in HIV care and its relevance to test-and-treat strategies for prevention of HIV infection (2011) Clin Infect Dis, 52 (6), pp. 793-800; Cohen, M.S., Chen, Y.Q., McCauley, M., Gamble, T., Hosseinipour, M.C., Kumarasamy, N., Prevention of HIV-1 infection with early antiretroviral therapy (2011) N Engl J Med, 365 (6), pp. 493-505; (2013) HIV/AIDS Care Continuum: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, , http://aids.gov/federal-resources/policies/care-continuum/, [cited 2014 April 14].

Materials and Methods: Records of 137 children registered at ART Centre, Government Wenlock Hospital, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore from 2004 till 2010 were studied and data for this retrospective study was collected. Results: Twenty three (16.8%) children developed otorhinolaryngological manifestations, which were upper respiratory tract infection (13.1%), oral candidiasis (1.4%), otitis media (1.4%) and parotitis (1%). With increasing WHO stage, the ENT manifestations increased (p<0.05) while CD4 count decreased (p>0.05), 35% and 44% cases with ENT manifestations had CD4 counts above 500 cells/mm3 and below 200 cells/mm3 respectively (p>0.05). 24% children on HAART and 10.7% not on HAART developed ENT illnesses (p<0.05). Conclusion: With the current ART protocols, ENT manifestations are seen in 17% HIV positive children, most of which are aspecific. © 2015, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

Methods: We downloaded 19,234 Written Parliamentary Questions directed at the Department for International Development posed by Members of Parliament between June 2001 and September 2014. We categorised questions by theme, party of questioner, geographical area, date and government. We then identified questions which specifically referenced HIV, TB and Malaria, or the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria. Analyses were conducted on each of these categorisations to identify trends which could account for differences in government funding between the three diseases. Results: A significantly greater number of questions were posed on HIV than on TB and Malaria. These questions were more likely to reference a specific geographical area, and come from a wider group of MPs. A broadly equivalent number of questions were asked on TB and Malaria although there were differences between the parties of the MPs tabling questions. We also identified a significant fall in the number of WPQs tabled from the Labour government of 2005-2010 and the Coalition Government of the present day. Conclusion: High volumes of WPQs targeting specific policy areas or geographical locations can play a role in increasing political commitment within government towards a certain disease or condition, however other factors, including high-level MP champions and party policy, can play an equally significant role. Nonetheless, evidence suggests that a broad base of political support (as manifested through WPQs) is important to motivating a government response to a health issue and that the TB community should devote more effort to mobilising this wide political support. © 2015 The Authors.","HIV/AIDS; Malaria; Scrutiny; Tuberculosis; UK Parliament","http://www.who.int/tb/dots/political_commitment_financing/en/, accessed October 2014Global Report, UNAIDS report on the global aids epidemic 2013.

The impact of HIV/AIDS on surgical practice include the undoubted risk to which the surgeon will expose him or herself, the atypical conditions that may be encountered and the outcome and long term benefit of the surgical treatment in view of disease progression. The two factors most associated with surgical outcome and poor wound healing were AIDS and poor performance status (ASA score). This article questions whether gastrointestinal surgical procedures can be safe and effective therapeutic measures in HIV/AIDS patients and if surgical outcome is worthy of the surgeon's ethical responsibility to treat. As HIV/AIDS patients are not a homogeneous group, with careful patient selection, emergency laparotomy for peritonitis confers worthwhile palliation. However, aggressive surgical intervention must be undertaken with caution and adequate peri-operative care is required. Symptomatic improvement of anorectal pathology may make delayed wound healing an acceptable complication. Alternatives to surgery can be contemplated for diagnosis, prophylaxis or palliation. © 2014 The Authors.","Anorectal disorders; Gastrointestinal pathologies; HIV/AIDS; Surgery","Miles, A.J.G., Wastell, C., AIDS and the general surgeon (1991) Recent Adv Surg, 14, pp. 85-98; Irowa, O., HIV/AIDS, surgical complications and challenges, the Nigerian experience (2007) Benin J Postgrad Med, 9 (1), pp. 55-57; Dua, R.S., Wajed, S.A., Winsler, M.C., Impact of HIV and AIDS on surgical practice (2007) Ann R Coll Surg Engl, 89, pp. 354-358; Smit, S., (2010) Guidelines for surgery in the HIV patients continuous medical education (CME), 28 (8); Barre-Sinoussi, F., Chermann, J.C., Rey, F., Isolation of T- lymphotropic retrovirus from a patient at risk of AIDS (1983) Science, 220, pp. 868-870; Gallo, R.C., Salahuddin, S.Z., Popovic, M., Human T -lymphotropic retrovirus, HTLV III, isolated from AIDS patients and donors at risks for AIDS (1984) Science, 224, pp. 500-503; Tilzey, A.J., (1992) Epidemiology of HIV and associated viruses: studies in surgery (1), , Royal College of Surgeons of England, J.P.S.

In this publication, effects on communication about sexuality with significant adults (including parents) and such communication as a mediator of other outcomes were examined. Belonging to the intervention group was significantly associated with fewer reported sexual debuts in Dar es Salaam only (OR 0.648). Effects on communication with adults about sexuality issues were stronger for Dar es Salaam than for the other sites. In Dar, increase in communication with adults proved to partially mediate associations between intervention and a number of social cognition outcomes. The hypothesized mediational effect of communication on sexual debut was not confirmed. Promoting intergenerational communication on sexuality issues is associated with several positive outcomes and therefore important.

In 2010, most ART clinics were decentralized to primary health facilities. ART coverage, i.e. people living with HIV (PLHIV) on combination treatment as a proportion of those in need of treatment, provides the basis for evaluating the efficiency of ART programs at national and district level. We aimed to evaluate adult ART and pre-ART care coverage by age and sex at CD4 < 200, < 350 and all PLHIV in the Rufiji district of Tanzania from 2006 to 2010. Methods: The numbers of people on ART and pre-ART care were obtained from routinely aggregated, patient-level, cohort data from care and treatment centers in the district. We used ALPHA model to predict the number in need of pre-ART care and ART by age and sex at CD4 < 200 and < 350. Results: Adult ART coverage among PLHIV increased from 2.9% in 2006 to 17.6% in 2010. In 2010, coverage was 20% for women and 14.8% for men. ART coverage was 30.2% and 38.7% in 2010 with reference to CD4 criteria of 350 and 200 respectively. In 2010, ART coverage was 0 and 3.4% among young people aged 15-19 and 20-24 respectively. ART coverage among females aged 35-39 and 40-44 was 30.6 and 35% respectively in 2010. Adult pre-ART care coverage for PLHIV of CD4 < 350 increased from 5% in 2006 to 37.7% in 2010. The age-sex coverage patterns for pre-ART care were similar to ART coverage for both CD4 of 200 and 350 over the study period. Conclusions: ART coverage in the Rufiji district is unevenly distributed and far from the universal coverage target of 80%, in particular among young men. The findings in 2010 are close to the most recent estimates of ART coverage in 2013. To strive for universal coverage, both the recruitment of new eligible individuals to pre-ART and ART and the successful retention of those already on ART in the program need to be prioritized. © 2015 Levira et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","AIDS; Antiretroviral; ART; ARV; Coverage; HIV; Rufiji; Tanzania; Treatment",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928747673

The study covered a sample of 296 prisoners enrolled in a population of 706 prisoners held in Nouakchott. The sex ratio was 14.6. The refusal rate of blood sample was 4.7%. HIV prevalence in the sample was 3.9%. 53.37% of prisoners knew the concept of seropositivity but only 7.4% had a perfect knowledge of the ways of HIV transmission untainted by false beliefs. The results showed that 99% of prisoners knew that the condom is a means of protection against HIV infection, but they also showed many false beliefs about protection against HIV in the majority of prisoners. Indeed, 98.49% of respondents said protect themselves by avoiding sex with strangers and 94.97% of them thought that sex with girls or virgins are a protection against HIV. Nearly one quarter of the prisoners did not have a good perception of risk of contracting HIV in prison although homosexual relations between prisoners have been reported. This study showed that prisoners in Mauritania are a vulnerable group to HIV because the prevalence of HIV in this group was higher than the national prevalence and this sub-population was unfamiliar with the disease and adopt risk behaviors. © 2015 Springer-Verlag France","Africa; AIDS; Dar-Naîm; HIV; Mauritania; Nouakchott; Prevalence; Prison; Prisoners; Risk behavior; Sebkha",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923818064

Methods: To formulate these recommendations, a panel composed of members of the AIDS Study Group and the AIDS National Plan (GeSIDA/Plan Nacional sobre el Sida) reviewed the efficacy and safety advances in clinical trials, and cohort and pharmacokinetic studies published in medical journals (PubMed and Embase) or presented in medical scientific meetings. The strength of the recommendations, and the evidence that supports them, are based on modified criteria of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Results: In this update, cART is recommended for all patients infected by type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). The strength and level of the recommendation depends on the CD4+. T-lymphocyte count, the presence of opportunistic diseases or comorbid conditions, age, and prevention of transmission of HIV. The objective of cART is to achieve an undetectable plasma viral load. Initial cART should always comprise a combination of 3 drugs, including 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and a third drug from a different family. Three out of the ten recommended regimes are regarded as preferential (all of them with an integrase inhibitor as the third drug), and the other seven (based on a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor, or an integrase inhibitor) as alternatives. This update presents the causes and criteria for switching cART in patients with undetectable plasma viral load, and in cases of virological failure where rescue cART should comprise 3 (or at least 2) drugs that are fully active against the virus. An update is also provided for the specific criteria for cART in special situations (acute infection, HIV-2 infection, and pregnancy) and with comorbid conditions (tuberculosis or other opportunistic infections, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer). Conclusions: These new guidelines update previous recommendations related to cART (when to begin and what drugs should be used), how to monitor and what to do in case of viral failure or drug adverse reactions. cART specific criteria in comorbid patients and special situations are equally updated. © 2015 Elsevier España, S.L.U. y Sociedad Española de Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiología Clínica.","AIDS; Antiretroviral treatment; GESIDA; Guideline; HIV infection; Recommendations; Spanish National AIDS Plan",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928911717

Here, we compare adolescent pre-ART mortality to that of adults in a public sector HIV care programme in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we compared adolescent pre-ART outcomes with those of adults enrolled for HIV care in the same clinic. Adolescents were defined as those aged 10 - 19 at the time of registration. Comparisons of means and proportions were carried out using two-tailed sample t-tests and chi-square tests respectively, for normally distributed data, and the Mann - Whitney U-tests for non-normally distributed data. Loss to follow-up (LTFU) was defined as missing a scheduled appointment by three or more months. Results: Between 2004 and 2010, 1382 of 1628 adolescents and 7557 of 11,106 adults who registered for HIV care met the eligibility criteria for ART. Adolescents registered at a more advanced disease stage than did adults (83% vs. 73% WHO stage III/ IV, respectively, p <0.001), and the median time to ART initiation was longer for adolescents than for adults [21 (10 - 55) days vs. 15 (7 - 42) days, p <0.001]. Among the 138 adolescents and 942 adults who never commenced ART, 39 (28%) of adolescents and 135 (14%) of adults died, the remainder being LTFU. Mortality among treatment-eligible adolescents awaiting ART was significantly higher than among adults (3% vs. 1.8%, respectively, p=0.004). Conclusions: Adolescents present to ART services at a later clinical stage than adults and are at an increased risk of death prior to commencing ART. Improved and innovative HIV case-finding approaches and emphasis on prompt ART initiation in adolescents are urgently needed. Following registration, defaulter tracing should be used, whether or not ART has been commenced. © 2015 Shroufi A et al; licensee.","Adolescent; Africa; ART; HIV/AIDS; Pre-ART","WHO, UNAIDS, UNICEF, Towards universal access scaling up priority hiv aids interventions in the health sector progress report (2010) World Health Organisation HIV/AIDS Department, , 2010.Geneva, Switzerland; Feucht, U.D., Kinzer, M., Kruger, M., Reasons for delay in initiation of antiretroviral therapy in a population of HIV-infected South African children (2007) J Trop Pediatr, 53 (6), pp. 398-402; McGrath, N., Glynn, J.R., Saul, J., Kranzer, K., Jahn, A., Mwaungulu, F., What happens to ART-eligible patients who do not start ART?

However, few studies have been conducted in developing countries, such as China; therefore, the question of any association being present between social support and quality of life in PLWA in China remains unanswered. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the relationships between social support and quality of life among PLWA in the Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces of China. A total of 377 PLWA participated in this study, and questionnaires used included demographics, the Chinese Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36, and a Social Support Rating Scale, all of which were collected through face-to-face interviews between 1 March and 15 April 2013 in six different County Centers of Disease Control and Prevention in Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces, and one hospital in the Jiangxi. The health-related quality of life score was 64.7 ± 13.5 (out of a total score of 100), which was significantly lower than the national norm level of 78.2 ± 15.9. The total score of social support was 29.4 ± 7.8 (full score 66). The canonical correlation between social support and quality of participants' lives was shown to be statistically significant (p < 0.0001). The relationship between subjective support and quality of life among PLWA was also significant (p = 0.004). Subjective support and the use of social support showed a positive correlation with vitality, role-physical, and role-emotional, and a negative correlation with body pain. The current study suggests that PLWA with lower social support have diminished quality of life. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","canonical correlation; HIV/AIDS; Jiangxi; quality of life; social support; Zhejiang",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923279940

Conventional atomic-resolution structural biology techniques, X-ray crystallography and solution NMR spectroscopy provided abundant information on the structures of individual proteins and nucleic acids comprising viruses; however, viral assemblies are not amenable to analysis by these techniques because of their large size, insolubility, and inherent lack of long-range order. In this article, we review the recent advances in magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy that enabled atomic-resolution analysis of structure and dynamics of large viral systems and give examples of several exciting case studies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) model for implementation posits that implementation will be most successful when the evidence, context, and facilitation strategies are strong for the clinical practice. We evaluated the relative importance of perceived evidence, context, and facilitation of HIV testing during the implementation of a multimodal intervention in US Department of Veterans Affairs primary care clinics. Methods: A multimodal intervention including clinical reminders (CRs), academic detailing-providing education sessions for providers-and social marketing to improve HIV testing was implemented in 15 VA primary care clinics in three regions. We conducted qualitative formative and process evaluations using semi-structured interviews with HIV lead clinicians, primary care lead clinicians, nurse managers, and social workers. Interviews were analyzed thematically to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of HIV testing and how these were addressed by the intervention. Sites were then rated high, medium, or low on the dimensions of perceived evidence and the context for testing. We then assessed the relationship of these ratings to improvements in HIV testing rates found in earlier quantitative analyses. Results: Sites that showed greatest improvements in HIV testing rates also rated high on evidence and context. Conversely, sites that demonstrated the poorest improvements in testing rates rated low on both dimensions. Perceptions of evidence and several contextual aspects resulted in both barriers and facilitators to implementing testing. Evidence barriers included provider perceptions of evidence for routine testing as irrelevant to their population. Contextual barriers included clinical reminder overload, insufficient resources, onerous consent processes, stigma, provider discomfort, and concerns about linking individuals who test positive to HIV treatment. While most barriers were ameliorated by the intervention, HIV stigma in particular regions and concerns about linkage to care persisted. Conclusions: Interventions to implement evidence-based practices such as HIV testing can be successful when utilizing proven quality improvement techniques. However, it is critical to address providers' perceptions of evidence and consider aspects of the local context in order to fully implement new routine clinical practices such as HIV testing. © Bokhour et al.","Health promotion/prevention; HIV/AIDS; Implementation; Primary care; Qualitative research; Technology adoption/diffusion","Revised recommendations for HIV testing of adults, adolescents, and pregnant women in health-care settings (2006) MMWR, 55, pp. 1-17; http://www.hiv.va.gov/provider/policy/informed-consent.asp, Changes in policies related to HIV testing: informatics supportHalloran, J., Czarnogorski, M., Dursa, E.K., Volpp, B.D., Durfee, J.M., Valdiserri, R.O., HIV testing in the US Department of Veterans Affairs, 2009-2010 (2012) Arch Intern Med, 172, pp. 61-62; Fung, C.H., Tsai, J.S., Lulejian, A., Glassman, P., Patterson, E., Doebbeling, B.N., An evaluation of the Veterans Health Administration's clinical reminders system: a national survey of generalists (2008) J Gen Intern Med, 23, pp. 392-398; Saleem, J.J., Patterson, E.S., Militello, L., Anders, S., Falciglia, M., Wissman, J.A., Impact of clinical reminder redesign on learnability, efficiency, usability, and workload for ambulatory clinic nurses (2007) J Am Med Inform Assoc, 14, pp. 632-640; Saleem, J.J., Patterson, E.S., Militello, L., Render, M.L., Orshansky, G., Asch, S.M., Exploring barriers and facilitators to the use of computerized clinical reminders (2005) J Am Med Inform Assoc, 12, pp. 438-447; Goetz, M.B., Bowman, C., Hoang, T., Anaya, H., Osborn, T., Gifford, A.L., Implementing and evaluating a regional strategy to improve testing rates in VA patients at risk for HIV, utilizing the QUERI process as a guiding framework: QUERI Series (2008) Implement Sci, 3, p. 16; Goetz, M.B., Hoang, T., Bowman, C., Knapp, H., Rossman, B., Smith, R., A system-wide intervention to improve HIV testing in the Veterans Health Administration (2008) J Gen Intern Med, 23, pp. 1200-1207; Goetz, M.B., Hoang, T., Knapp, H., Burgess, J., Fletcher, M.D., Gifford, A.L., Central implementation strategies outperform local ones in improving HIV testing in Veterans Healthcare Administration facilities (2013) J Gen Intern Med, 28, pp. 1311-1317; Kitson, A.L., Rycroft-Malone, J., Harvey, G., McCormack, B., Seers, K., Titchen, A., Evaluating the successful implementation of evidence into practice using the PARiHS framework: theoretical and practical challenges (2008) Implement Sci, 3, p. 1; Fetters, M.D., Curry, L.A., Creswell, J.W., Achieving integration in mixed methods designs-principles and practices (2013) Health Serv Res, 48, pp. 2134-2156; Stetler, C.B., Legro, M.W., Wallace, C.M., Bowman, C., Guihan, M., Hagedorn, H., The role of formative evaluation in implementation research and the QUERI experience (2006) J Gen Intern Med, 21, pp. S1-S8; Thomson O'Brien, M.A., Oxman, A.D., Haynes, R.B., Davis, D.A., Freemantle, N., Harvey, E.L., Local opinion leaders: effects on professional practice and health care outcomes (2000) Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 1; Jamtvedt, G., Young, J.M., Kristoffersen, D.T., O'Brien, M.A., Oxman, A.D., Audit and feedback: effects on professional practice and health care outcomes (2006) Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 2; Thomson O'Brien, M.A., Oxman, A.D., Davis, D.A., Haynes, R.B., Freemantle, N., Harvey, E.L., Educational outreach visits: effects on professional practice and health care outcomes (2000) Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 4; Bernard, H.R., Fieldnotes: how to take them, code them, manage them (2002) Research methods in anthropology: qualitative and quantitative approaches, pp. 365-389. , Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira Press; Charmaz, K., (2006) Constructing grounded theory, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Patterson, E.S., Doebbeling, B.N., Fung, C.H., Militello, L., Anders, S., Asch, S.M., Identifying barriers to the effective use of clinical reminders: bootstrapping multiple methods (2005) J Biomed Inform, 38, pp. 189-199; Patterson, E.S., Nguyen, A.D., Halloran, J.P., Asch, S.M., Human factors barriers to the effective use of ten HIV clinical reminders (2004) J Am Med Inform Assoc, 11, pp. 50-59; Burke, R., Sepkowitz, K., Bernstein, K., Karpati, A., Myers, J., Tsoi, B., Why don't physicians test for HIV?

This study determined the validity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the HIV Dementia Scale (HDS) in detecting cognitive impairment using both the Frascati and cognitive impairment, no dementia (CIND) criteria to classify cognitive impairment in HIV-1 infected patients. The MoCA, HDS, and an extensive neuropsychological assessment, covering nine cognitive domains, were administered in a group of 102 HIV-infected patients who were all on cART and virologically suppressed for at least 1 year. Results show that the areas under the curve (AUCs) for both the MoCA and the HDS were statistically significant, using both the Frascati and the CIND criteria as gold standard. However, the AUCs for the MoCA and HDS did not differ significantly, regardless of the used classification criteria (Frascati: z = 0.37, p = 0.35; CIND: z = −0.62, p = 0.27). Sensitivity of both the MoCA and HDS were low for the recommended cutoff scores (Frascati: MoCA (<26) = 0.56, HDS (<11) = 0.26; CIND: MoCA (<26) = 0.55, HDS (<11) = 0.36). Cutoff scores with good sensitivity and adequate specificity could not be determined for both screening instruments. Therefore, the HDS and MoCA are not recommended as sole instruments to diagnose HIV-associated cognitive impairment. © 2015 The Author(s)","Cognitive impairment; HDS; HIV/AIDS; MoCA; Screening tool",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922712918

We apply the synthetic control group method and estimate the consequences for life expectancy, mortality, and birth rates. According to standard measures of fit, the method seems to perform well for all countries and outcomes. Our results show a large effect on life expectancy and mortality in two countries, and a small and insignificant effect on birth rates. The impact of the pandemic is very heterogeneous. In Mozambique, the impact of HIV on life expectancy and mortality appears to have been surprisingly small. This heterogeneity is not due to AIDS causing fewer deaths in Mozambique than in the two other countries. Instead, the net effect of HIV in Mozambique appears to be diminished by reduced mortality for other causes—in particular child mortality, respiratory infections, and injuries. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","AIDS; Fertility; HIV; Life expectancy; Mortality; Synthetic control groups",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922693440

Over 60% of births in Nigeria occur outside of health care facilities, and because of this, Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) play a significant role in maternal and child health. It is important that TBAs be knowledgeable about HIV prevention. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of HIV testing and counseling (HTC) knowledge on the HIV prevention practices among TBAs in Nigeria. Five hundred TBAs were surveyed. Chi-square and logistic regression were used to assess differences in HIV prevention practices between TBAs with and without HTC knowledge. TBAs with HTC knowledge are significantly more likely to engage in HIV prevention practices than TBAs without HTC. Prevention practices included: wearing gloves during delivery (p < 0.01), sterilization of delivery equipment (p < 0.01), participation in blood safety training (p < 0.01), and disposal of sharps (p < 0.01). As long as a high percent of births occur outside health care facilities in Nigeria, there will be a need for TBAs. Providing TBAs with HTC training increases HIV prevention practices and can be a key to improve maternal and child health. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","HIV and AIDS; HIV preventive practices; HIV testing and counseling; Risk factors; Traditional birth attendances","Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey 2013 (2014) NPC and ICF International, , National Population Commission (NPC) [Nigeria] and ICF International, Abuja, Nigeria; Publication of Specific Country Estimates (2014) The Gap Report; UNAIDS, , Joint United Nations Programmes on HIV/AIDS, Geneva, Switzerland; Children and Pregnant Women Living with HIV (2014) The Gap Report; UNAIDS, , Joint United Nations Programmes on HIV/AIDS, Geneva, Switzerland; The 2010–2015 HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (2010) National Agency for the Control of AIDS, , National Agency for the Control of AIDS, Abuja, Nigeria; Bassey, E., Elemuwa, C., Anukam, K., Knowledge of, and attitudes to, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) among traditional birth attendants (TBAs) (2007) Int.

Structured interviews were conducted with women (n = 67) from a municipal housing estate in Durban, SA. Key informants (n = 12) also participated in semi-structured interviews. Findings revealed that participants had low cervical cancer knowledge, but desired more information. Relevant themes included the normalisation of HIV and beliefs that cervical cancer might be worse than HIV. A comprehensive community clinic was desired by most, even if HIV-positive patients were treated there.

Significant attention has been paid to the ""Big Three"" infectious pathogens - human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria, and tuberculosis (TB) - but other conditions such as Chagas' disease, dengue, Ebola, and typhoid, as well as multipathogen processes such as viral hepatitis, pneumonia, and diarrhea, also have major global impact. Addressing these significant disease burdens, which disproportionately impact the world's poorest regions, is a multifaceted grand challenge, requiring new solutions and new technologies. Diagnostics enabled by advances in microfluidics and nanotechnologies can be an important part of the solution. Advantages such as smaller sample size, increased sensitivity, and new multiplexed sensing modalities in a point-of-care format can allow rapid dissemination of test results in remote and resource-limited regions. In this review, we provide a critical assessment of the state-of-the-art in use of these technologies for detection of HIV, malaria, and TB. In addition to discussing opportunities and future prospects, we also discuss the need for additional governmental and nongovernmental funding sources to develop these technologies to their fullest potential, and the need for new business models to enable their commercialization and deployment. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Biosensors; diagnostics; global health; HIV/AIDS; infectious diseases; malaria; microfluidics; nanotechnology; point-of-care; tuberculosis","United Nations, (2014) The Millennium Development Goals Report 2014, , New York, NY, USA; W.

Using data from the 2010 Malawi Demographic Health Survey and the 2011 Uganda AIDS Indicator Survey, the paper takes advantage of a natural experiment, the implementation of Universal Primary Education policies in the mid 1990s. An instrumented regression discontinuity approach is used to model the relationship between increased primary schooling and adult women's HIV status. Results indicate that a one-year increase in schooling decreases the probability of an adult woman testing positive for HIV by 0.06 (. p<0.01) in Malawi and by 0.03 (. p<0.05) in Uganda. These results are robust to a variety of model specifications. In a series of supplementary analyses a number of potential pathways through which such effects may occur are explored. Findings indicate increased primary schooling positively affects women's literacy and spousal schooling attainment in Malawi and age of marriage and current household wealth in Uganda. However primary schooling has no effect on recent (adult) sexual behavior. © 2014 The Author.","HIV/AIDS; Natural experiment; Sexual behavior; Sub-Saharan Africa; Universal primary education","Alsan, M., Cutler, D.M., Girls education and HIV risk: evidence from Uganda (2013) J.Health Econ., 32, pp. 863-872; Angrist, J., Pischke, J.S., (2009) Mostly Harmless Econometrics: an Empiricists' Companion, , Princeton University Press, Princeton USA; Baird, S., Garfein, R.S., McIntosh, C., Ozler, B., Effect of a cash transfer programme for schooling on prevalence of HIV and herpes simplex type 2 in Malawi: a cluster randomised trial (2012) Lancet, 379, pp. 1320-1329; Deininger, K., Does cost of schooling affect enrollment by the poor?

Many Chinese MSM still lack sufficient access to HIV prevention services, despite ongoing scale-up of comprehensive HIV testing and intervention services. The purpose of this study was to investigate utilization of HIV testing and prevention services, and related factors that influence the MSM people to access HIV test or other services to prevent HIV among MSM in Beijing, China.Three successive cross-sectional surveys of MSM were conducted in Beijing from September 2009 to January 2010, September 2010 to January 2011, and September 2011 to January 2012. Demographic and behavioral data were collected and analyzed. Blood samples were tested for HIV and syphilis. Three models were established to analyze factors associated with HIV testing and preventive services.Of the 1312 participants, prevalence of HIV and syphilis was 7.9% and 15.4%, respectively. Sixty-nine percent ever had an HIV test, 56.2%, 78.7%, and 46.1% received HIV test, free condom/lubricants, and sexually transmitted infection services in the past 12 months (P12M), respectively. MSM with larger social networks and who knew someone infected with HIV were more likely to receive HIV testing and preventive services; lower degrees of stigma and discriminatory attitudes toward HIV/AIDS were positively associated with having an HIV test, whereas unprotected anal intercourse in the past 6 months (P6M) was associated with less preventive services participation. The most reported barriers to HIV testing were fear of testing HIV positive (79.3%) and perceiving no risk for HIV (75.4%). Almost all participants felt that ensuring confidentiality would encourage more MSM to have an HIV test. The two main reasons for not seeking HIV test was not knowing where to go for a test (63.2%) and perceiving low risk of HIV infection (55.1%).Given a high prevalence of HIV, syphilis, and risky behaviors and a relatively low HIV testing rate among MSM in Beijing, more efforts are urgently needed to address barriers to HIV testing and improve accessibility of prevention services.",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928585137

Most studies that examine barriers to and facilitators of adherence to HAART have been conducted with people on these medications, which is critical to improving adherence among various HIV-affected groups. Less attention has been paid to the experiences of HIV care providers, which is an important gap in the literature considering the key role they play in the delivery of HAART and the management of patient treatment plans. This paper presents findings from a qualitative pilot study that explored how HIV care providers assess adherence and non-adherence to HAART among their HIV-positive patients in Vancouver, British Columbia. Drawing upon individual interviews conducted with HIV physicians (n = 3), social service providers (n = 3) and pharmacists (n = 2), this discussion focuses on the social typologies our participants use to assess patient success and failure related to adherence. Eleven unique categories are featured and the diversity within and across these categories illustrate a broad spectrum of adherence-related behaviours among patients and the social meanings providers attribute to these behaviours. As one of the first explorations of the social typologies used by HIV care providers to assess patient performance on HAART, these data contribute valuable insights into the experiences of providers within the context of adherence-related care delivery. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","adherence; HAART; health care practitioners; HIV/AIDS; non-adherence; social services",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921919462

Design: Retrospective, postmortem observational study. Methods: Clinical neuropsychological and postmortem neuropathology data were analyzed in 90 HIV-infected volunteers from the general community who had never undergone ART (n=7, 'naive') or who had undergone ART and whose plasma viral load was detectable (n=64 'unsuppressed') or undetectable (n=19, 'suppressed') at the last clinical visit before death. Individuals were predominately men (74/90, 82%) with a mean age of 44.7 years (SD 9.8). Cortical neurodegeneration was quantified by measuring microtubule-associated protein (MAP2) and synaptophysin (SYP) density in midfrontal cortex tissue sections. Results: The suppressed group had higher SYP density than the naive group (P=0.007) and higher MAP2 density than the unsuppressed group (P=0.04). The suppressed group had lower odds of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders than naive [odds ratio (OR) 0.07, P=0.03]. Higher SYP was associated with lower likelihood of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in univariable (OR 0.8, P=0.03) and multivariable models after controlling for ART and brain HIV p24 protein levels (OR 0.72, P=0.01). Conclusion: We conclude that virally suppressive ART protects against cortical neurodegeneration. Further, we find evidence supporting the causal chain from treatmentmediated peripheral and central nervous system viral load suppression to reduced neurodegeneration and improved neurocognitive outcomes.

The success of recent public health initiatives to increase numbers of circumcised men in Malawi has been very limited. We conducted in-depth interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) with men, women and male adolescents from non-circumcising and circumcising communities in southern Malawi to better understand their beliefs about male circumcision and the promotion of VMMC for HIV prevention. Results revealed that beliefs about male circumcision, in general, are strongly mediated by Malawian culture and history. Participants have attempted to develop a new meaning for circumcision in light of the threat of HIV infection and the publicised risk reduction benefits of VMMC. Several study participants found it difficult to distinguish VMMC from traditional circumcision practices (jando and lupanda), despite awareness that the new form of circumcision was an expression of (western) modern medicine performed largely for public health purposes. Greater recognition of background cultural beliefs and practices could inform future efforts to promote medical male circumcision as an HIV prevention strategy in this context. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","AIDS; cultural practices; HIV prevention; Malawi; male circumcision; religion; sexuality",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921917374

We estimated the proportion of patients <25 years at HIV diagnosis by calendar year among the general population and MSM. 19,466 (CCASAnet) and 3,746 (VCCC) patients were included. The proportion <25 years at diagnosis in VCCC increased over time for both the general population and MSM (p < 0.001). Only in the Chilean site for the general population and the Brazilian site for MSM were similar trends seen. Subjects <25 years of age at diagnosis were less likely to be immunocompromised at enrollment at both the VCCC and CCASAnet. Recent trends in the USA of greater numbers of newly diagnosed young patients were not consistently observed in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Use of dual health systems has been associated with worse outcomes. Veterans with HIV may have different rates of Medicare and Medicaid enrollment and may be at greater risk of poor outcomes related to non-VA use. This study compares the frequency and factors associated with Medicare and/or Medicaid enrollment and non-VA use in an HIV-infected and uninfected population of veterans. Methods: We used data from the VA and Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services from 2004 and 2005 to determine the frequency of Medicare and/or Medicaid enrollment among a cohort of HIV-infected and uninfected veterans engaged in VA care. We then restricted the cohort to veterans enrolled in fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare and/or Medicaid with at least one hospitalization and identified characteristics associated with non-VA hospital admissions. Results: HIV-infected veterans had higher rates of Medicare and/or Medicaid enrollment than uninfected veterans (38% vs. 33%, p < 0.01), though the opposite was true when our sample was limited to veterans 65 years and older (53% vs. 70%, p < 0.0 1). Among veterans enrolled in the VA and FFS Medicare and/or Medicaid, veterans with HIV had greater illness severity and more frequent hospitalizations, but were less likely to be hospitalized outside the VA (48% vs. 54%, p < 0.01). HIV infection was associated with lower odds of outside hospitalization (OR = 0.76 [95% CI: 0.68, 0.85]). Conclusions: Veterans with HIV have higher rates of Medicare and/or Medicaid enrollment, but lower odds of non-VA hospitalization. The VA integrated model of HIV care may discourage outside use among HIV-infected veterans. © 2015 Chang et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","AIDS; Fragmentation; HIV; Medicaid; Medicare; Veterans","Haley, J.K., Kenney, G.M., Uninsured veterans and family members: State and National Estimates of expanded medicaid eligibility under the ACA (2013) Timely Analysis of Immediate Health Policy Issues, , Urban Institute; Trivedi, A.N., Grebla, R.C., Jiang, L., Yoon, J., Mor, V., Kizer, K.W., Duplicate federal payments for dual enrollees in Medicare advantage plans and the Veterans affairs health care system (2012) JAMA, 308 (1), pp. 67-72; Tarlov, E., Lee, T.A., Weichle, T.W., Durazo-Arvizu, R., Zhang, Q., Perrin, R., Reduced overall and event-free survival among colon cancer patients using dual system care (2012) Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev, 21 (12), pp. 2231-2241; Wolinsky, F.D., An, H., Liu, L., Miller, T.R., Rosenthal, G.E., Exploring the association of dual use of the VHA and Medicare with mortality: Separating the contributions of inpatient and outpatient services (2007) BMC Health Serv Res, 7, p. 70; Wolinsky, F.D., Miller, T.R., An, H., Brezinski, P.R., Vaughn, T.E., Rosenthal, G.E., Dual use of Medicare and the Veterans Health Administration: Are there adverse health outcomes?

These may include combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) regimen, sociodemographic factors, nutritional–hematological status, HIV-relevant clinical variables, and cognitive functioning. We explored associations between a number of these factors and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures in 50 cART-treated children aged 6 to 15 years. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusion (MD), radial diffusion (RD), and axial diffusion (AD) were derived from 48 cerebral white matter regions. Significant associations between a number of the clinical variables and white matter integrity were found. Decreased FA, a measure of neuronal damage, was associated with being on second-line cART, low hemoglobin, and younger age. Children with increased MD, a measure of neuronal damage, were younger, had reduced albumin and hemoglobin, and increased viral load. Decreased AD, a measure of axonal damage, was associated with increased viral load and total protein, decreased albumin and hemoglobin, younger age, poorer fronto-striatal cognition, and being on second-line cART. Increased RD, a measure of myelin loss, was associated with younger age, low current CD4 count, low albumin and hemoglobin, and higher viral load and total protein. The current findings underline the possible association of first-line treatment failure with white matter brain dysfunction in pediatric neuroHIV and the importance of examining the effects of HIV disease in the context of treatable clinical variables such as anemia and nutritional status. © 2015 Journal of NeuroVirology, Inc.","Cognitive impairment; Diffusion tensor; HIV/AIDS; Imaging; Pediatric",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921860733

However, little has been explored on the sexual risk behaviours of high school female learners in Cameroon. This study aimed at examining the sexual risk behaviours of high school female learners in Mbonge subdivision of rural Cameroon.Methods: a cross sectional design was adopted, using a self-administered questionnaire for data collection. Respondents were selected through disproportional stratified simple random sampling resulting in 210 female grade 10 to grade 12 learners from three participating high schools in Mbonge subdivision, Cameroon. Descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated using SPSS version 20 software program.Results: majority of the respondents, 54.0% reported being sexually active, of whom only 39.8% used condoms during first sex; 49.5% used condoms during last sex and 29.6% used condoms consistently. Up to 32% of the sexually active respondents had multiple sexual partners in the past one year before the study, while 9.3% had multiple sexual partners during the study period. The mean age of first sex was 15.6 years. Lack of parental control, religion, academic profile, poverty, place of residence and perception of risk of HIV infection were the main factors significantly associated with sexual risk behaviours.Conclusion: the findings indicate that sexual risk behaviours exist among high school female learners in Mbonge, Cameroon. There is need for campaigns and interventions to bring about sexual behaviour change. © Elvis Enowbeyang Tarkang et al.","High school female learners; HIV/AIDS; Mbonge subdivision; Rural Cameroon; Sexual risk behaviours","(2010) Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic, , UNAIDS, Geneva, Switzerland: UNAIDS, Google Scholar; (2011) World AIDS Day Report: How to Get Zero-Faster, , UNAIDS, Smarter, Better.

RAL should be double-dosed to 800mg semi-daily in situation of rifampicin co-medication, because RAL is more rapidly metabolized due to rifampicin-induced Uridine-5'-diphosph- gluronosyl-transferase (UGT1A1). Recently, it was speculated that chewed RAL might lead to increased absorption, which might compensate the inductive effect of rifampicin-rapid metabolized RAL, as part of cost-saving effects in countries with high-tuberculosis prevalence and less economic power. Methods: We report measurement of raltegravir pharmacokinetics in a 34-year AIDS-patient suffering from disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection with necessity of parenteral rifampicin treatment. RAL levels were measured with HPLC (internal standard: carbamazepine, LLQ 11ng/ml, validation with Valistat 2.0 program (Arvecon, Germany)). For statistical analysis, a two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired samples was used. Results: High intra-personal variability in raltegravir serum levels was seen. Comparable Cmax concentrations were found for 800mg chewed and swallowed RAL, as well as for 400mg chewed and swallowed RAL. While Cmax seems to be more dependent from overall RAL dosing than from swallowed or chewed tablets, increased AUC12 is clearly linked to higher RAL dosages per administration. Anyway, chewed raltegravir showed a rapid decrease in serum levels. Conclusions: We found no evidence that chewed 400mg semi-daily raltegravir in rifampicin co-medication leads to optimized pharmacokinetics. There is need for more data from randomized trials for further recommendations. © Spinner et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Chewed; HIV; Mycobacterium avium; Pharmacokinetic; Raltegravir","Adams, J.L., Greener, B.N., Kashuba, A.D.M., Pharmacology of HIV integrase inhibitors (2012) Curr Opin HIV AIDS, 7, pp. 390-400; Ingen, J., Hoefsloot, W., Mouton, J.W., Boeree, M.J., Soolingen, D., Synergistic activity of rifampicin and ethambutol against slow-growing nontuberculous mycobacteria is currently of questionable clinical significance (2013) Int J Antimicrob Agents, 42, pp. 80-82; Zhao, X., Wang, Y., Pang, Y., Antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular characterization of mycobacterium intracellulare in China (2014) Infect Genet Evol, 27, pp. 332-338; Wenning, L.A., Hanley, W.D., Brainard, D.M., Petry, A.S., Ghosh, K., Jin, B., Mangin, E., Iwamoto, M., Effect of rifampicin, a potent inducer of drug-metabolizing enzymes, on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir (2009) Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 53, pp. 2852-2856; Gervasoni, C., Riva, A., Impagnatiello, C., Galli, M., Cattaneo, D., Is chewed raltegravir an option to care for HIV-infected patients with active tuberculosis?

We developed a system dynamics model of the continuum of HIV care in Vancouver, Canada, which reflects key activities and decisions in the delivery of antiretroviral therapy, including HIV testing, linkage to care, and long-term retention in care and treatment. To measure the influence of operational interventions on population health outcomes, we incorporated an HIV transmission component into the model. We determined optimal resource allocations among targeted and routine testing programs to minimize new HIV infections over five years in Vancouver. Simulation scenarios assumed various constraints informed by the local health policy.

There is limited research on lipodystrophy in low- and middle-income countries, despite accounting for more than 95% of the burden of HIV/AIDS. The objective of this review was to evaluate the prevalence, pathogenesis and prognosis of HIV-related lipoatrophy, lipohypertrophy and mixed syndrome, to inform clinical management in resource-limited settings. Methods: We conducted a structured literature search using MEDLINE electronic databases. Relevant MeSH terms were used to identify published human studies on HIV and lipoatrophy, lipohypertrophy, or mixed syndrome in low-, low-middle- and upper-middle-income countries through 31 March 2014. The search resulted in 5296 articles; after 1599 studies were excluded (958 reviews, 641 non-human), 3697 studies were extracted for further review. After excluding studies conducted in high-income settings (n =2808), and studies that did not meet inclusion criteria (n =799), 90 studies were included in this review. Results and Discussion : Of the 90 studies included in this review, only six were from low-income countries and eight were from lower middle-income economies. These studies focused on lipodystrophy prevalence, risk factors and side effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART). In most studies, lipodystrophy developed after the first six months of therapy, particularly with the use of stavudine. Lipodystrophy is associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic complications. This is disconcerting and anticipated to increase, given the rapid scale-up of ART worldwide, the increasing number and lifespan of HIV-infected patients on long-term therapy, and the emergence of obesity and non-communicable diseases in settings with extensive HIV burden. Conclusions: Lipodystrophy is common in resource-limited settings, and has considerable implications for risk of metabolic diseases, quality of life and adherence. Comprehensive evidence-based interventions are urgently needed to reduce the burden of HIV and lipodystrophy, and inform clinical management in resource-limited settings. © 2015 Finkelstein JL et al; licensee International AIDS Society.","AIDS; Antiretroviral therapy; Fat redistribution; HIV; Lipodystrophy","Delaney, M., History of HAART - The true story of how effective multi-drug therapy was developed for treatment of HIV disease (2006) Retrovirology, 3, p.

This study's objective is to examine sexual behavior, levels of knowledge, and attitudes toward HIV/AIDS between two cohorts in Spanish adolescents, and to analyze gender differences in these cohorts. Participants were 2132 adolescents between 15 and 18 years of age: 1222 in 2006 (43.2% boys) and 910 in 2012 (54.1% boys). The results indicate lower HIV knowledge and less favorable attitudes about HIV/AIDS in the 2012 cohort. In addition, adolescents from the 2012 cohort had their first sexual intercourse at an earlier age and have more sexual partners than those from the 2006 cohort. Compared to boys, girls engage in fewer risky behaviors, although they did not use condoms with their stable partner; girls tended to use condom less when they were in a stable relationship than boys. This study confirms the insufficiency of prevention campaigns as well as the need to improve the impact from programs that promote healthy sexual habits. Assuming comparability of cohorts, this study suggests increased risk of HIV/AIDS over time. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","adolescents; condom; HIV/AIDS; risk behaviors; sexual behaviors",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921342170

We conducted a secondary analysis comparing participants with respect to presence or absence of M. tuberculosis bacteremia. Methods: Participants with a baseline mycobacterial blood culture were compared with respect to the presence or absence of M. tuberculosis bacteremia. Baseline predictors of M. tuberculosis bacteremia were identified and participant outcomes were compared by mycobacteremia status. Results: Of 90 participants with baseline mycobacterial blood cultures, 29 (32.2%) were female, the median (IQR) age was 37 (31-45) years, CD4 count was 81 (33-131) cells/mm3, HIV-1 RNA level was 5.39 (4.96-5.83) log10 copies/ mL, and 18 (20.0%) had blood cultures positive for M. tuberculosis. In multivariable analysis, lower CD4 count (OR 0.85 per 10-cell increase, p = 0.012), hemoglobin ≤8.5 g/dL (OR 5.8, p = 0.049), and confirmed tuberculosis (OR 17.4, p = 0.001) were associated with M. tuberculosis bacteremia. There were no significant differences in survival and AIDS-free survival, occurrence of tuberculosis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), or treatment interruption or discontinuation by M. tuberculosis bacteremia status. IRIS did not differ significantly between groups despite trends toward more virologic suppression and greater CD4 count increases at week 48 in the bacteremic group. Conclusions: Among HIV-infected tuberculosis suspects, lower CD4 count, hemoglobin ≤8.5 g/dL, and the presence of microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis were associated with increased adjusted odds of mycobacteremia. No evidence of an association between M. tuberculosis bacteremia and the increased risk of IRIS was detected. © 2015 Crump et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Africa; Asia; Bacteremia; HIV; Treatment outcome; Tuberculosis","Iseman, M.D., Extrapulmonary tuberculosis in adults (2000), pp. 145-197. , In: A clinician's guide to tuberculosis. 1st ed.

This prospective analysis of longitudinal data collected from an outpatient methamphetamine abuse treatment program for gay and bisexual men assessed whether symptoms of depression mediated and/or moderated the associations between methamphetamine use and unprotected insertive/receptive anal intercourse. Method: From November 2005 through October 2007, 167 treatment-seeking gay and bisexual men (63% HIV-positive) enrolled in and attended a 16-week methamphetamine abuse outpatient treatment program. Participants' depressive symptoms, biomarker-confirmed methamphetamine use, and self-reported sexual risk taking were assessed at baseline and follow-up evaluations. Path analysis tested the mediating and moderating effects of depression on the associations between methamphetamine use and unprotected insertive/receptive anal intercourse. Results: Methamphetamine use during the treatment period had a significant indirect (Coef. = ?.15; 95% CI [?.23, ?.06]), but no direct (Coef. = .11; ns) or total effect (Coef. = ?.04; ns) on participants' sexual risk taking after accounting for the significant mediating (Coef. = .56; 95% CI [.33, .78]) and moderating (Coef. = ?.03; 95% CI [?.04, ?.02]) effects of depression. Conclusions: Depression fully mediated and weakly moderated associations between methamphetamine use and sexual risk taking in this sample. Interventions and treatment programs to reduce sexual risk taking among gay and bisexual men should simultaneously address methamphetamine use and depression to optimize health outcomes.

The goal of this study was to investigate the associations between positive and negative coping strategies and diurnal cortisol among children affected by parental HIV/AIDS. Method: Participants were 645 children aged 8-15 affected by parental HIV/AIDS, who provided 4 saliva samples per day over 3 days (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) to assess diurnal cortisol. Positive and negative coping strategies were measured via self-report prior to saliva collection. Possible confounds of the associations between coping and diurnal cortisol also were assessed, including age, gender, socioeconomic status, parenting quality, parental death, other stressful life events, sleep quality, and perceived health status. Results: Greater positive coping (e.g., problem solving, cognitive reframing) was associated with children's higher morning cortisol (p = .037), whereas greater negative coping (e.g., fighting, breaking things) was independently associated with lower morning cortisol (p = .038) and a flatter diurnal cortisol slope (p = .003). These associations remained significant after controlling for potential confounds. Neither positive coping nor negative coping interacted with stressful life circumstances to predict cortisol (all ps > .27). Conclusion: These findings indicate the extent to which a child's coping strategy is associated with indicators of stress biology in the context of having a parent with HIV/AIDS.

A total of 112 MSM Facebook users were recruited online and offline and completed an online survey. We performed regression models to assess the association between HIV status, SNS use, and sexual risk behaviors. After adjusting for age, race, and employment status, being HIV positive was significantly associated with a greater number of sexual partners (ARR = 2.84, p = 0.0017) and lower comfort levels of discussing HIV/STI status on SNSs (AOR: 0.23, p = 0.011).

We conducted six focus group sessions with 50 English-or Spanish-speaking PLWH in New York City. To inform data analysis and to illustrate how mHealth technology can be used as a persuasive strategy for improving the health of PLWH, we integrated Fogg’s functional role triad for computing technology model with the self-determination theory to illustrate how mHealth technology can be used as a persuasive strategy for improving the health of PLWH. Participants suggested several tools for meeting their healthcare needs, including: reminders/alerts, lab results tracking, and notes on health status. mHealth technology can function as a social actor by providing chat boxes/forums, testimonials of lived experiences, and personal outreach. Examples of media that can be used as a persuasive technology include games/virtual rewards, coding of health tasks, and simulations on how to connect with PLWH.

This study described factors from Andersen’s behavioral model that were associated with retention in HIV care among 268 female sex workers (FSWs) living with HIV in the Dominican Republic using two measures of retention: a 6-month measure of HIV clinic attendance and a measure that combined clinic attendance and missed visits. FSWs who ever attended HIV care reported high rates (92 %) of 6-month attendance, but 37 % reported missed visits. Using the combined retention measure, the odds of being retained in HIV care were higher among FSWs with more positive perceptions of HIV service providers [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.17; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 01.09, 1.25] and lower among women who reported recent alcohol consumption (AOR 0.50; 95 % CI 0.28, 0.92) and self-stigmatizing beliefs related to sex work (AOR 0.93; 95 % CI 0.88, 0.98). These findings support the hypothesis that retention in HIV care may be best determined through a combined measure as missed visits are an important mechanism to identify in-care patients who require additional support. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Antiretroviral therapy; Female sex workers; HIV/AIDS; Measurement; Retention",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920849235

We assessed linkage and retention in HIV care among people living with HIV (PLHIV) enrolled at a private HIV care clinic in Pune, India. Of 1220 patients, 28% delayed linkage after HIV diagnosis with a median delay of 24 months (IQR = 8–43). Younger people, women, low socioeconomic status, and those diagnosed at facilities other than the study clinic were more likely to delay linkage. Those with advanced HIV disease at diagnosis and testing for HIV due to HIV-related illness were linked to care immediately. Of a total of 629 patients eligible for ART at first CD4 count, 68% initiated ART within 3 months. Among those not eligible for ART, only 46% of patients sought subsequent CD4 count in time. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that patients with initial CD4 count of 350–500 cells/cu mm (OR: 2, 95% CI: 1.1–3.5) and >500 cells/cu mm (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2–3.7) were less likely to do subsequent CD4 test on time as compared to those with CD4 < 50 cells/cu mm. Among patients not eligible for ART, those having >12 years of education (OR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2–0.9) were more likely to have timely uptake of subsequent CD4 count. Among ART eligible patients, being an unskilled laborer (OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1–4.2) predicted lower uptake. The study highlights a long delay from HIV diagnosis to linkage and further attrition during pre-ART and ART phases. It identifies need for newer approaches aimed at timely linkage and continued retention for patients with low education, unskilled laborers, and importantly, asymptomatic patients. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","HIV/AIDS; India; linkage to HIV care; retention in HIV care; uptake of CD4 counts",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920771031

Three pharmacies located in heavy, drug-active neighborhoods in New York City and registered to sell nonprescription syringes were trained to recruit their nonprescription syringe customers who inject drugs and their under/uninsured customers. Syringe customer participants were trained to recruit up to three of their peers. As part of a larger intervention to increase HIV testing, participants in two of three study arms viewed the “Health Screenings for Life” video and were administered pre/post-video surveys capturing HIV stigma. Participants in the nonvideo arm were administered one assessment of HIV stigma. Log-binomial regression with generalized estimating equations to account for clustering of peer networks was used to: (1) determine factors associated with HIV stigma and (2) determine differences in HIV stigma by study arm. A total of 716 participants were recruited. Factor analyses showed HIV stigma measures loading on two factors: HIV blame and HIV shame. After adjustment, HIV blame was positively associated with younger age (PR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.07–1.43) and inversely associated with educational attainment (PR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.58–0.76) and employment (PR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.60–0.96). HIV shame was inversely associated with educational attainment (PR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.62–0.92), HIV-positive status (PR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.39–0.92), and injecting drugs (PR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.54–0.94) and was positively associated with multiple sex partnerships (PR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.01–1.52). Those who viewed the video were also less likely to report HIV blame and HIV shame, post-video, compared to those in the nonvideo arm. These data provide evidence of an association between HIV stigma and lower socioeconomic status groups, and between HIV stigma and HIV sexual risk.

However, ARVs have a darker side. Since 2000, many HIV-positive people in Thailand have received ARV treatments, but the understanding of ARVs and practices of medication-taking among HIV-positive women have not received much attention. We discuss local discourses employed by HIV-positive women and health work by these individuals in their attempts to adhere to ARVs restrictions. The local discourse of ARVs was ya tan rok AIDS ""medications that could resist HIV/AIDS."" ARVs provided hope for the women. Although the women were affected by the side effects of ARVs, they continued to take their medication to be able to live longer and perform their duties as mothers and carers. They were more concerned about the practice of medication-taking. Understanding why these women were adherent to their ARVs offers insights into the social impact of these ARVs on their lives. © The Author(s) 2014.","adherence / compliance; Asia, South / Southeast; Asian people / cultures; HIV/AIDS; hope; interviews, semistructured; lived experience; medication; stigma; women's health","Ammaranond, P., Sanguansittianan, S., Mechanism of HIV antiretroviral drugs progress toward drug resis-tance (2012) Fundamental & Clinical Pharmacology, 26, pp. 46-161; Arbune, M., Georgescu, C., Cuciureanu, M., Dobre, M., Effectiveness and safety of salvage therapy on Romanian HIV infected patients (2013) Famacia, 61, pp. 390-397; Badahdah, A.M., Pedersen, D.E., ""I want to stand on my own legs"": A qualitative study of antiretroviral therapy adherence among HIV-positive women in Egypt (2011) AIDS Care, 23, pp. 700-704; Balthip, Q., Boddy, J., Siriwatanamethanon, J., (2013) Stigma, Discrimination and Living with HIV/AIDS: A Cross-cultural Perspective, pp. 357-375. , Liamputtong P., ed.

SETTINGS AND DESIGN: In this cross-sectional survey conducted between November and September 2013, 200 participants with HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) attending Consultation Centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants with HIV/AIDS were interviewed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales questionnaire (DASS21). RESULTS: There were significant associations between marital status of women and the level of depression (P &lt; 0.05). However, the mean depression and anxiety in women are greater than men (P &lt; 0.05), and the mean stress in men is greater than women (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection is related with psychiatric disorders. According to the results, women are more vulnerable to depression and anxiety and they need more care. Management of these psychiatric disorders is very important and requires innovative comprehensive approaches.","AIDS; Anxiety; Depression; HIV; Stress","UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic, , http://www.unaids.org/globalrepor/documents/20101123_GlobalReport_full_en.pdf, Available from [Last accessed on 2015 Jan 09]; Annual Report of HIV in Iran, , http://www.behdasht.gov.ir, Available from [Last accessed on 2015 Jan 09]; Anthony, S., Fauci, H., Clifford, L., Human immunodeficiency virus disease AIDS and related disorders (2012) Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, pp. 1506-1587. , Frederick P, editor 18th ed.

It is clearly important to develop interventions which focus on this highly infectious stage of HIV infection to prevent further transmission in the risk networks of acutely and recently infected individuals. Project Protect tries to find recently and acutely infected individuals and prevents HIV transmission in their risk networks. Participants are recruited by community health outreach workers at community-based HIV testing sites and drug users' community venues, by coupon referrals and through referrals from AIDS clinics. When a network with acute/recent infection is identified, network members are interviewed about their risky behaviors, network information is collected, and blood is drawn for HIV testing. Participants are also educated and given prevention materials (condoms, syringes, educational materials); HIV-infected participants are referred to AIDS clinics and are assisted with access to care. Community alerts about elevated risk of HIV transmission are distributed within the risk networks of recently infected. Overall, 342 people were recruited to the project and screened for acute/recent HIV infection. Only six index cases of recent infection (2.3% of all people screened) were found through primary screening at voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) sites, but six cases of recent infection were found through contact tracing of these recently infected participants (7% of network members who came to the interview). Combining screening at VCT sites and contact tracing the number of recently infected people we located as compared to VCT screening alone. No adverse events were encountered. These first results provide evidence for the theory behind the intervention, i.e., in the risk networks of recently infected people there are other people with recent HIV infection and they can be successfully located without increasing stigma for project participants. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Acute infection; HIV; Prevention; Recent infection; Social networks intervention","Ambrosioni, J., Junier, T., Delhumeau, C., Calmy, A., Hirschel, B., Zdobnov, E., Yerly, S., Impact of highly active anti-retrovival therapy on the molecular epidemiology of newly diagnozed HIV infections (2012) AIDS, 26, pp. 2079-2086; Brenner, B.G., Roger, M., Routy, J.-P., Moisy, D., Ntemgwa, M., Matte, C., Wainberg, M.A., High rates of forward transmission events after acute/early HIV-1 (2007) The Journal of Infectious Diseases, 195, pp. 951-959; Brenner, B.G., Roger, M., Stephens, D., Moisi, D., Hardy, I., Weinberg, J., Wainberg, M.A., Transmission clustering drives the onward spread of the HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men in Quebec (2011) The Journal of Infectious Diseases, 204, pp. 1115-1119; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Detection of acute HIV infection in two evaluations of a new HIV diagnostic testing algorithm - United States (2013) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 62 (24), pp. 489-494. , June 21; Christopoulos, K.A., Zetola, N.M., Klausner, J.D., Haller, B., Louie, B., Hare, C.B., Pilcher, C.D., Leveraging a rapid, round-the-clock HIV testing system to screen for acute HIV infection in a large urban public medical center (2013) Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, 62 (2), pp. e30-e38; Cohen, M.S., Chen, Y.Q., McCauley, M., Gamble, T., Hosseinipour, M.C., Kumarasamy, N., Prevention of HIV-1 infection with early antiretroviral therapy (2011) New England Journal of Medicine, 365, pp. 493-505; Duong, Y.T., Maofeng, Q., Anindya, K.D., Jackson, K., Dobbs, T., Kim, A.A., Parekh, B.S., Detection of recent HIV-1 infection using a new limiting-antigen avidity assay: Potential for HIV-1 incidence estimates and avidity maturation studies (2012) PLoS One, 7, p. e33328; Fotiou, A., Micha, K., Paraskevis, D., Terzidou, M., Malliori, M.M., Hatzakis, A., (2012) HIV Outbreak among Injecting Drug Users in Greece.

Design and Setting: Prospective cohort study of PWID in Vancouver, Canada, recruited between May 1996 and December 2011. We ascertained morality rates and causes of death through a confidential linkage with the provincial vital statistics registry. Participants: A total of 2283 individuals were followed for a median of 60.9 months (interquartile range: 34.4-113.1), among whom 622 (27.2%) individuals were HIV-positive at baseline, and 179 (7.8%) seroconverted during follow-up. Measurements: The primary and secondary outcomes of interests were all-cause mortality and cause of death, respectively. The main independent variable of interest was HIV serostatus (positive versus negative). We used Cox proportional hazards regression to determine factors associated with mortality, including socio-demographic variables, drug use behaviors and other risk behaviors. Findings: During the study period, 491 (21.5%) individuals died. In multivariate analyses, HIV infection remained associated independently with all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio=3.15; 95% CI: 2.59-3.82). While all-cause mortality rates declined markedly during the study period (P<0.001), the independent effect of HIV infection on mortality remained unchanged over time (P=0.640). Among HIV-positive individuals, significant changes in causes of death from infectious and AIDS-related causes to non-AIDS-related etiologies were observed. Conclusions: HIV infection continues to have a persistent impact on mortality rates among people who inject drugs in settings with free HIV/AIDS care, although causes of death have shifted markedly from infectious and AIDS-related causes to non-AIDS-related etiologies. © 2014 Society for the Study of Addiction.","Free HIV/AIDS care; HIV/AIDS; Illicit drug use; Injection drug use; Mortality; People who inject drugs (PWID); Vancouver","Mathers, B.M., Degenhardt, L., Bucello, C., Lemon, J., Wiessing, L., Hickman, M., Mortality among people who inject drugs: a systematic review and meta-analysis (2013) Bull World Health Organ, 91, pp. 102-123; Hickman, M., Carnwath, Z., Madden, P., Farrell, M., Rooney, C., Ashcroft, R., Drug-related mortality and fatal overdose risk: pilot cohort study of heroin users recruited from specialist drug treatment sites in London (2003) J Urban Health, 80, pp. 274-287; Miller, C.L., Kerr, T., Strathdee, S.A., Li, K., Wood, E., Factors associated with premature mortality among young injection drug users in Vancouver (2007) Harm Reduct J, 4, pp. 1-7; Gossop, M., Stewart, D., Treacy, S., Marsden, J., A prospective study of mortality among drug misusers during a 4-year period after seeking treatment (2002) Addiction, 97, pp. 39-47; Degenhardt, L., Hall, W., Warner-Smith, M., Using cohort studies to estimate mortality among injecting drug users that is not attributable to AIDS (2006) Sex Transm Infect, 82, pp. 356-363; (2006) Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic, , http://data.unaids.org/pub/globalreport/2006/2006_gr-executivesummary_en.pdf,http://www.webcitation.org/6SmclMher, Geneva: Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS; Available at: (accessed 22 September 2014) (Archived at ); De Cock, K.M., Jaffe, H.W., Curran, J.W., The evolving epidemiology of HIV/AIDS (2012) AIDS, 26, pp. 1205-1213; Sackoff, J.E., Hanna, D.B., Pfeiffer, M.R., Torian, L.V., Causes of death among persons with AIDS in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy: New York City (2006) Ann Intern Med, 145, pp. 397-406; Wood, E., Hogg, R.S., Yip, B., Harrigan, P.R., O'Shaughnessy, M.V., Montaner, J.S., Effect of medication adherence on survival of HIV-infected adults who start highly active antiretroviral therapy when the CD4+ cell count is 0.200 to 0.350×10(9) cells/L (2003) Ann Intern Med, 139, pp. 810-816; Egger, M., May, M., Chene, G., Phillips, A.N., Ledergerber, B., Dabis, F., Prognosis of HIV-1-infected patients starting highly active antiretroviral therapy: a collaborative analysis of prospective studies (2002) Lancet, 360, pp. 119-129; Collaboration, H.-C., Ray, M., Logan, R., Sterne, J.A., Hernandez-Diaz, S., Robins, J.M., The effect of combined antiretroviral therapy on the overall mortality of HIV-infected individuals (2010) AIDS, 24, pp. 123-137; Celentano, D.D., Mortality among urban drug users and the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy (2005) Clin Infect Dis, 41, pp. 873-874; Wood, E., Hogg, R.S., Lima, V.D., Kerr, T., Yip, B., Marshall, B.D., Highly active antiretroviral therapy and survival in HIV-infected injection drug users (2008) JAMA, 300, pp. 550-554; Wolfe, D., Carrieri, M.P., Shepard, D., Treatment and care for injecting drug users with HIV infection: a review of barriers and ways forward (2010) Lancet, 376, pp. 355-366; Ding, L., Landon, B.E., Wilson, I.B., Wong, M.D., Shapiro, M.F., Cleary, P.D., Predictors and consequences of negative physician attitudes toward HIV-infected injection drug users (2005) Arch Intern Med, 165, pp. 618-623; Maisels, L., Steinberg, J., Tobias, C., An investigation of why eligible patients do not receive HAART (2001) AIDS Patient Care STDS, 15, pp. 185-191; Deadly denial: barriers to HIV/AIDS treatment for people who use drugs in Thailand (2007), http://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/thailand1107/thailand1107web.pdf,http://www.webcitation.org/6Smcg0D9R, New York: Human Rights Watch; Available at: (accessed 22 September 2014) (Archived atBobrova, N., Sarang, A., Stuikyte, R., Lezhentsev, K., Obstacles in provision of anti-retroviral treatment to drug users in Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia: a regional overview (2007) Int J Drug Policy, 18, pp. 313-318; Lert, F., Kazatchkine, M.D., Antiretroviral HIV treatment and care for injecting drug users: an evidence-based overview (2007) Int J Drug Policy, 18, pp. 255-261; Aceijas, C., Oppenheimer, E., Stimson, G.V., Ashcroft, R.E., Matic, S., Hickman, M., Antiretroviral treatment for injecting drug users in developing and transitional countries 1 year before the end of the 'Treating 3 million by 2005.

Participants viewed a 20-min video with Chinese subtitles, attended one 25-min small group discussion and condom interactive educational activity. Female participants showed significantly greater mean scores of perceived benefits and condom use self-efficacy, in comparison with male participants. Female participants also reported significantly higher scores than male participants in five of the perceived benefits items and one self-efficacy item.

Long-acting antiretroviral therapy (LA-ART) is currently under development and could improve outcomes for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals with poor daily ART adherence. Methods. We used a computer simulation model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 3 LA-ART strategies vs daily oral ART for all: (1) LA-ART for patients with multiple ART failures; (2) second-line LA-ART for those failing first-line therapy; and (3) first-line LA-ART for ART-naive patients. We calculated the maximum annual cost of LA-ART at which each strategy would be cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. We assumed HIV RNA suppression on daily ART ranged from 0% to 91% depending on adherence, vs 91% suppression on LA-ART regardless of daily ART adherence. In sensitivity analyses, we varied adherence, efficacy of LA-ART and daily ART, and loss to follow-up. Results. Relative to daily ART, LA-ART increased overall life expectancy by 0.15-0.24 years, and by 0.51-0.89 years among poorly adherent patients, depending on the LA-ART strategy. LA-ART after multiple failures became cost-effective at an annual drug cost of $48 000; in sensitivity analysis, this threshold varied from $40 000-$70 000. Second-line LA-ART and first-line LA-ART became cost-effective at an annual drug cost of $26 000-$31 000 and $24 000-$27 000, vs $28 000 and $25 000 for current second-line and first-line regimens. Conclusions. LA-ART could improve survival of HIV patients, especially those with poor daily ART adherence. At an annual cost of $40 000-$70 000, LA-ART will offer good value for patients with multiple prior failures. To be a viable option for first- or second-line therapy, however, its cost must approach that of currently available regimens. © 2015 © The Author 2015.

The New York State HIV Testing Law of 2010 requires diagnosing providers to refer persons newly diagnosed with HIV to follow-up medical care. This study used routinely collected HIV-related laboratory data from the New York State HIV surveillance system to assess whether the fraction of newly diagnosed cases entering care within 90 days of diagnosis increased after the implementation of the law. Laboratory data on 23,302 newly diagnosed cases showed that entry to care within 90 days rose steadily from 72.0% in 2007 to 85.4% in 2012. The rise was observed across all race/ethnic groups, ages, transmission risk groups, sexes, and regions of residence. Logistic regression analyses of entry to care pre-law and post-law, controlling for demographic characteristics, transmission risk, and geographic area, indicate that percentage of newly diagnosed cases entering care within 90 days grew more rapidly in the post-law period. This is consistent with a positive effect of the law on entry to care. © 2015 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Diagnosis; Entry to care; HIV; Law; Linkage",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920832563

The ultimate goal is to achieve a functional or actual cure for HIV infection. Despite multiple potential targets for GE-based HIV therapies, CCR5 is the most feasible owing to the naturally existing CCR5 δ32 genotype which confers resistance to HIV. A recent clinical trial of infusion of modified autologous CD4+ T cells proved safety and efficacy within the limits of the studies. However, long-term evaluation of the safety and efficacy is required before GE-based HIV therapy is ready for clinical implementation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","AIDS; CCR5; Genome editing; HIV; Infusion","HIV surveillance - United States, 1981-2008 (2011) MMWR Morb.

The Model of Human Occupation (MOHO) in conjunction with the Conceptual Framework for Therapeutic Occupation (CFTO) was used to guide the therapeutic process. Assessments measured challenges to clients and client progress in the following areas: leisure, mobility, organization, problem solving, community involvement, transitioning to independent living, fatigue, childcare/play, and home management.

HIV is a recognized risk factor for adverse birth outcomes. However, the influence of paternal involvement on fetal morbidity outcomes in women with HIV remains poorly understood. Using linked hospital discharge data and vital statistics records for the state of Florida (1998-2007), the authors assessed the association between paternal involvement and fetal growth outcomes (i.e., low birth weight [LBW], very low birth weight [VLBW], preterm birth [PTB], very preterm birth [VPTB], and small for gestational age [SGA]) among HIV-positive mothers (N = 4,719). Propensity score matching was used to match cases (absent fathers) to controls (fathers involved). Conditional logistic regression was employed to generate adjusted odds ratios (OR). Mothers of infants with absent fathers were more likely to be Black, younger (<35 years old), and unmarried with at least a high school education (p <.01). They were also more likely to have a history of drug (p <.01) and alcohol (p =.02) abuse. These differences disappeared after propensity score matching. Infants of HIV-positive mothers with absent paternal involvement during pregnancy had elevated risks for adverse fetal outcomes (LBW: OR = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-1.60; VLBW: OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.05-2.82; PTB: OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.13-1.69; VPTB: OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.13-2.90). Absence of fathers increases the likelihood of adverse fetal morbidity outcomes in women with HIV infection. These findings underscore the importance of paternal involvement during pregnancy, especially as an important component of programs for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. © The Author(s) 2013.","HIV/AIDS; parenting; population based; public health","Alexander, G.R., Kogan, M., Martin, J., Papiernik, E., What are the fetal growth patterns of singletons, twins, and triplets in the United States?

These supportive resources can be emotional, financial assistance, informational or companionship and also intangible. Social support can be measured as the perception that one has assistance available, the actual received assistance, or the degree to which a person is integrated in a social network. Support can come from many sources, such as family, friends, pets, neighbours, coworkers, organizations, etc. Those who receive social support will feel relaxed and loved. This study will discuss the support carried out by the NGO, Komuniti Cakna Terengganu (KCT), to HIVAIDS sufferers. KCT was established through an initiative from some former drug addicts who have been marginalized by their families and community. The focus of this study is to examine social support for HIV-AIDS patients and is limited to the role played by KCT. The objectives of this study are to analyze the views of patients with HIV/AIDS who received social support and to identify the obstacles faced by KCT in continuing support for the group. This study used the qualitative method with two techniques to get data; Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and observation. 18 respondents were involved in two FGD sessions. The study found that all patients are satisfied with the support given to them be it spiritual, informational or intangible. The programs are very effective and should be continued. Patients feel appreciated and gain more understanding about religion. To the respondents, religion becomes a filter for all negative things. There is a need for more NGOs such as KCT to provide support to marginalized groups such as the respondent. Government and private agencies and other NGOs should provide support in all forms to NGOs such as KCT. © 2015, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

We reviewed standardised casenotes of 136 MPSA victims and 139 SPSA victims attending for forensic medical examination (FME) between 1 July 2005 and 31 July 2009. MPSA victims reported a higher rate of stranger assaults, higher rates of vaginal, anal and oral rapes, more rapes at multiple anatomical sites or multiple rapes and were more likely to sustain injuries, all of which put MPSA victims at higher risk of subsequent health problems. Rates of attendance at follow-up appointments were low for all (53.5%) as were rates of completion of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV (33.3%). Attendance at follow-up was associated with presence of anogenital injury at the time of FME.

Therefore, our aim in this study was to document the dermatologic manifestations and their relationships with CD4 cell counts among HIV/AIDS patients visiting our clinic for the first time in İstanbul, Turkey. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis of 306 HIV/AIDS patients (260 men, mean age: 38.3 years) was done in a tertiary hospital in İstanbul from January 2006 to September 2012. Information on age, sex, transmission routes, socioeconomic and educational status, CD4 counts, and dermatologic findings was collected retrospectively from medical records.Results: Our analyses revealed at least 1 dermatologic disease in 111 of the 306 (36.2%) patients. Mean CD4 count of the patients was 393.64 cells/mm3 (range: 4–1270 cells/mm3). Oral candidiasis (12.4%), herpes zoster (5.9%), dermatophytosis (5.4%), hyperpigmentation (5.2%), and folliculitis (4.6%) were the most common skin problems. Statistically significant correlation (P < 0.05) with low CD4 cell counts was found for oral candidiasis, folliculitis, herpes zoster, hyperpigmentation, xerosis, and Kaposi’s sarcoma.Conclusion: Dermatologic manifestations in this study were identical to those described in most studies from Asia, and there were more manifestations as the HIV infection progressed and immune functions declined. © Tübitak.","CD4 lymphocyte counts; HIV/AIDS; Mucocutaneous findings","Sud, N., Shanker, V., Sharma, A., Sharma, N.L., Gupta, M., Mucocutaneous manifestations in 150 HIV-infected Indian patients and their relationship with CD4 lymphocyte counts (2009) Int J STD AIDS, 20, pp. 771-774; Sivayathorn, A., Srihra, B., Leesanguankul, W., Prevalence of skin disease in patients infected human immunodeficiency virus in Bangkok, Thailand (1995) Ann Acad Med Singapore, 24, pp. 528-533; Wiwanitkit, V., Prevalence of dermatological disorders in Thai HIV-infected patients correlated with different CD4 lymphocyte count statuses: A note on 120 cases (2004) Int J Dermatol, 43, pp. 265-268; Foroughi, M., Koochak, H.E., Roosta, N., Paydary, K., Khatami, A., Shahriari, S., Payvarmehr, T., Seyed Alinaghi, S., Prevalence of dermatologic manifestations among people living with HIV/ AIDS in Imam Khomeini Hospital in Tehran, Iran (2012) J AIDS HIV Res, 4, pp. 56-59; Cedeno-Laurent, F., Gomez-Flores, M., Mendez, N., Ancer-Rodriquez, J., Bryant, J.L., Gaspari, A.A., Trujillo, J.R., New insights into HIV-1-primary skin disorders (2011) J Int AIDS Soc, 14, p. 5; Shobhana, A., Guha, S.K., Neogi, D.K., Mucocutaneous manifestations in HIV infection (2004) Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol, 70, pp. 82-86; Josephine, M., Issac, E., George, A., Ngole, M., Albert, S.E., Patterns of skin manifestations and their relationships with CD4 counts among HIV/AIDS patients in Cameroon (2006) Int J Dermatol, 45, pp. 280-284; Boztepe, G., Akoğlu, G., Şahin, G.O., Güven, G.S., Ünal, S., Şahin, S., HIV/AIDS and skin: 7-year of experience at Hacettepe (2006) Turk Derm, 40, pp. 46-51. , (article in Turkish with English abstract); Singh, H., Singh, P., Tiwari, P., Dey, V., Dulhani, N., Singh, A., Dermatological manifestations in HIV-infected patients at a tertiary care hospital in a tribal (Bastar) region of Chhattisgarh, India (2009) Indian J Dermatol, 54, pp. 338-341; Azfar, N.A., Khan, A.R., Zia, M.A., Humayun, A., Malik, L.M., Jahangir, M., Frequency of mucocutaneous manifestations in HIV positive Pakistani patients (2011) J Pak Assoc Dermatol, 21, pp. 149-153; Spira, R., Mingard, M., Doutre, M.S., Molart, P., Dabis, F., Prevalence of cutaneous disorders in a population of HIV-infected patients (1998) Arch Dermatol, 134, pp. 1208-1212; Esser, S., Schoefer, H., HIV-associated skin and mucocutaneous diseases (2010) HIV 2010, pp. 568-580. , Hoffman C, Rockstroh JK, editors, Hamburg, Germany: Medizin Fokus Verlag; Huang, X.J., Li, H.Y., Chen, D.X., Wang, X.C., Li, Z.C., Wu, Y.S., Zhang, T., Wu, H., Clinical analysis of skin lesions in 796 Chinese HIV-positive patients (2011) Acta Derm Venerol, 91, pp. 552-556; Kim, T.G., Lee, K.H., Oh, S.H., Skin disorders in Korean patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus and their association with a CD4 lymphocyte count: A preliminary study (2010) J Eur Acad Venereol, 24, pp. 1476-1480; Garbe, C., Husak, R., Orfanos, C.E., HIV-associated dermatoses and their prevalence in 456 HIV-infected patients.

Stigma has been associated with adverse health outcomes, including poor adherence to care, and increased participation in HIV transmission risk behaviours. We evaluated the level of felt stigma and its relationship to other psychosocial and medical factors among a sample of 201 individuals with HIV engaged in care. The overall mean stigma score, as measured by the Reece Stigma Scale, was 21.7 (SD 8.7). In univariate analysis, felt stigma scores were higher among women, African Americans, younger participants, and individuals with less education. Higher felt stigma scores were also found among individuals who reported having fair to poor overall health, moderate to severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, and those with a current diagnosis of alcohol dependence, generalised anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, pain disorder, and current smokers. Higher felt stigma scores were independently associated with individuals with anxiety symptoms. These analyses highlight that stigma persists among individuals with HIV and may play an important role in HIV care. The relationship between psychiatric disorders and psychosocial factors highlights an opportunity to develop interventions that will address these common comorbidities and reduce stigma. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","HIV management; HIV/AIDS; mental illness; psychiatric disorders; psychological distress; Stigma","http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/resources/factsheets/incidence.htm, CDC.

Methods: According to WHO (2008) classification of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue tumors, we analyzed 10 cases of HIV/AIDS related BL collected from August 2010 to March 2013, using methods of HE staining, immunohistochemical EnVision dyeing, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and in situ hybridization combined with clinical data. Results: Ten biospy were done, among which 4 cases were armpit lump, 3 neck lump, 1 inguinal mass, and 2 abdominal mass. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor cells showed that expression of IgM, CD20, CD19, CD79a, CD10 and Bcl-6 were positive, while they were negative for CD5, CD21, CD30, EMA, Bcl-2, CD3, ALK-1 and TdT. The proliferation index of all cases of Ki67 was higher than 90%. CD38 and MUM-1 were expressed in 1 case, c-myc in 3 cases, LMP-1 in 1 case, and mutant P53 in 5 cases. EBER was detected by in situ hybridization in 3 cases, C-MYC fracture of recombinant gene t(8; 14) (q24; q32) was detected by FISH in 8 cases. Pathological diagnosis: 9 cases were classical BL and 1 case was BL with plasma cell differentiation. Conclusions: HIV-BL is a highly malignant lymphoma with poor prognosis. It is easy to confuse with diffuse large B cell lymphoma and lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia in light microscopy.

The programme aims to address taboos, stigma, discrimination, HIV/AIDS prevention and the promotion of sexual reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and a healthy lifestyle among adolescents. The programme uses an “edutainment” model that involves young people through music, dance and youth icons. Educated volunteers provide schoolchildren with comprehensive information on SRHR and demonstrate the practical application of life and leadership skills. The programme ends with a celebration event.Design/methodology/approach – Qualitative and quantitative methods were used. Only those who got as far as stage three of the process, 20 per cent of those who begun, were sampled. The qualitative research involved youth aged 13-19 (20 interviews, six focus groups), teachers (eight interviews), volunteer team members (eight interviews) and programme managers in four project regions and in Moscow (five interviews). In the quantitative research 105 respondents took part, of whom 48 per cent were 13-16 years old, 44 per cent were 17-19 years old and 8 per cent were 20-23 years old. Both boys and girls were included in the sample.Findings – Young people’s participation in D4L had a significant positive impact on perceptions of SRHR and knowledge levels, changed some misconceptions about HIV/AIDS and helped develop social and healthy lifestyle skills. The programme contributed to the growth of voluntary activity and the organizational skills of participants. Teachers’ perceptions of SRHR changed positively after their participation in the programme.Research limitations/implications – The fact that the sample is only those who completed all stages of the programme, 20 per cent of the overall population who began it, is clearly a source of bias. The size of the quantitative research sample (n=105) does not allow disaggregation of data by region nor by gender: this limitation was minimized by choosing four regions with relatively comparable socio-economic status, and through quota sampling in equal proportions for boys and girls. This is the first time such a study has been conducted, so it is not possible to draw conclusions about the long-term impact of the programme.Practical implications – The short implementation period allows for the dissemination of information and training to large numbers despite limited funding.Social implications – The D4L approach provides information on SRHR to youth, which arouses their interest, and is perceived as relevant and important. Programme participants use this information themselves and share it with their friends, parents and other adults.Originality/value – The D4L programme is unique in Russia: there is no regular sexual education in Russian schools. School programmes are rarely evaluated with the methods used in this study. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Adolescent sexual health; Health promotion; Healthy schools; HIV/AIDS; Relationships; Russia; Sex education","Bandura, A., (1977) Social Learning Theory, , Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs.

These diseases are the most common AIDS-presenting illnesses in some countries. Although morbidity and mortality have significantly decreased with the advent of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy, significant challenges exist in treating patients, among them overlapping medication toxicities, drug-drug interactions and the risk of developing Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome. Mycobacterial resistance to existing antimicrobials continues to rise, further complicating the management of these patients and presenting a public health challenge.Solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients are also at increased risk of developing TB and MAC disease. In addition, although patients with cellular immune defects are perceived to be at higher risk for non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection, limited data exist on the frequency of these infections in this patient population. Incidence may be influenced by the degree of immunosuppression and the types of immunosuppressants used. Diagnosis is sometimes challenging, and the clinician needs to keep a high index of suspicion to correctly diagnose the syndromes caused by these bacteria.The author will review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic methods and principles of treatment of the most common mycobacteria that cause disease in HIV and transplant recipients, and will discuss some of the nuances in the management of these patients. © 2014 Asian-African Society for Mycobacteriology.","HIV/AIDS; Mycobacteria; Transplant",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920861026

In order to develop culturally appropriate and effective actions and programmes to reduce HIV transmission, it is necessary to understand attitudes, behaviours and norms surrounding sexual networking and safer-sex practices in Nepal. Nepali women are thought to be at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV, sexual violence and exploitation and other sexual health disparities due to cultural scripts limiting access to education, ability to control sexual relationships and acceptability in discussing sex and sexual health. The present study comprises a series of interviews with 25 women living in Kathmandu (13 individual interviews and 2 focus-group discussions) about their knowledge and experiences related to sex and sexual health. Interviews were translated and transcribed and two independent coders conducted a thematic analysis. Overall, the women described sex as primarily a male domain. Sex and sexual health were viewed as taboo discussion topics and formal sex education was perceived as minimally available and far from comprehensive in its scope. This formative study can inform future interventions aimed at reducing the spread of STIs/HIV in Nepal and empowering women on issues of sexual health and well-being. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","gender norms; HIV/AIDS; Nepal; sexual health; STIs; women's health","Adhikari, R., Tamang, J., Premarital Sexual Behavior among Male College Students of Kathmandu, Nepal (2009) BMC Public Health, 9 (1), pp. 241-249; Agampodi, S., Agampodi, T., Ukd, P., Adolescents' Perception of Reproductive Health Care Services in Sri Lanka (2008) BMC Health Service Research, 98, pp. 1-8; Ali, T., Ali, P., Waheed, H., Memon, A., Understanding of Puberty and Related Health Problems among Female Adolescents in Karachi Pakistan (2006) Journal of Pakistan Medical Association, 56 (2), pp. 68-72; Ali, M., Bhatti, M., Ushijima, H., Reproductive Health Needs of Adolescent Males in Rural Pakistan: An Exploratory Study (2004) The Tohoku Journal of Experimental Medicine, 204 (1), pp. 17-25; Allendorf, K., Ghimire, D.J., Determinants of Marital Quality in an Arranged Marriage Society (2013) Social Science Research, 42 (1), pp. 59-70; Brown, J.B., The Use of Focus Groups in Clinical Research (1999) Doing Qualitative Research, pp. 109-124. , Crabtree B.

Despite considerable progress in HIV stigma-reduction research, we are still searching for effective strategies that can be implemented on a larger scale. To narrow this research gap, the present study investigated a novel cost-effective approach to reducing HIV-related stigma among health professionals. Interactive experiential games were used to help participants gain first-hand experience of potential stressors that PLHIV might encounter. The effectiveness of this game-based experiential approach was compared with that of in vivo contact in reducing HIV-related stigma among students in the health-care fields. Eighty-eight students of health-related programs in Hong Kong were randomly assigned to either the game-based or in vivo contact program. They completed measures of stigmatizing attitudes and HIV/AIDS-related knowledge at pre-program, post-program, and one-month follow-up. Findings showed that the effectiveness of the game-based experiential approach in reducing HIV-related stigma was similar to that of in vivo contact both at post-program and one-month follow-up. Further research is needed to explore the potential value of the game-based approach in reducing HIV stigma among health professionals. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","contact; experiential; game; health-care professionals; HIV/AIDS; stigma reduction","Abell, N., Rutledge, S.E., McCann, T.J., Padmore, J., Examining HIV/AIDS provider stigma: Assessing regional concerns in the islands of the Eastern Caribbean (2007) AIDS Care, 19, pp. 242-247; Andrewin, A., Chien, L.-Y., Stigmatization of patients with HIV/AIDS among doctors and nurses in Belize (2008) AIDS Patient Care and STDs, 22, pp. 897-906; Batson, C.D., Polycarpou, M.P., Harmon-Jones, E., Imhoff, H.J., Mitchener, E.C., Bednar, L.L., Highberger, L., Empathy and attitudes: Can feeling for a member of a stigmatized group improve feelings toward the group?

However, utilisation of these services remains limited among people living with HIV. We explored barriers to accessing HIV/AIDS-related services from the perspective of newly diagnosed HIV-positive men who have sex with men. We conducted repeated in-depth interviews with 31 newly diagnosed HIV-positive men who have sex with men, using the socio-ecological framework and thematic content analysis. Multiple barriers for utilisation of HIV/AIDS-related services were identified, including perceptions of subjective health and poor quality of services, mental and emotional health problems, lack of trust and understanding of the services on offer, low economic status, lack of insurance, and high medical fees, being refused access to services, and restrictive attendance policies.

We performed a prospective cohort study of visual inspection with acetic acid (N = 440) in HIV-infected women aged 25--59 years, with a nested study of HPV subtypes in first 300 women enrolled. Of 440 women screened, 9.5% (N = 42) had abnormal visual inspection with acetic acid with 69.0% (N = 29) having advanced disease not amenable to cryotherapy. Of 294 women with HPV results, 39% (N = 114) of women were positive for high-risk HPV infection. Only lower CD4 count (287 cells/mm3 versus 339 cells/mm3, p = 0.03) and high-risk HPV (66.7% versus 35.6%, p < 0.01) were associated with abnormal visual inspection with acetic acid. The most common high-risk HPV subtypes in women with abnormal visual inspection with acetic acid were 35 (33.3%), 16 (26.7%), and 58 (23.3%). Low CD4 cell count was associated with abnormal visual inspection with acetic acid and raises the importance of early antiretroviral therapy and expanded availability of visual inspection with acetic acid. HPV vaccines targeting additional non-16/18 high-risk HPV subtypes may have greater protective advantages in countries such as Malawi. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav","Africa; cervical cancer; cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; high-risk HPV; HIV/AIDS; human papillomavirus; sexually transmitted infection; visual inspection with acetic acid; women","Msyamboza, K.P., Dzamalala, C., Mdokwe, C., Burden of cancer in Malawi; common types, incidence and trends: National population-based cancer registry (2012) BMC Res Notes, 5, p. 149. , ,,, et al.. ;:-; (2010), http://www.hpvcentre.net/statistics/reports/MWI.pdf, World Health Organization and Institut Catala d’Oncologia.

Epidemiological, clinical, analytical and therapeutic data were collected. Patients completed a questionnaire about cardiovascular risk factors and underwent a physical examination and a 12-h fasting blood analysis. High ferritin levels were defined as a plasma ferritin level >200 µg/L in women and >300 µg/L in men. A total of 571 patients (78.1% men) were included. Median age was 43.2 years, HIV sexual transmission 68.5%, median CD4 count 474 cells/µL, 36.3% AIDS cases, 86.2% on antiretroviral therapy and 74.8% of them with undetectable viral load; 14.6% metabolic syndrome criteria, and mean cardiovascular risk at 10 years 6.67%. High ferritin levels prevalence was 11%, and related factors were a CD4 count <350 cells/µL (odds ratio, OR 2.37 [1.3–4.1], p = 0.003), ultrasensitive C-reactive protein >3 mg/L (OR 2.67 [1.5–4.7], p = 0.001) and chronic hepatitis C virus infection (OR 2.77 [1.5–4.9], p = 0.001). High ferritin levels are not uncommon in HIV patients, and they correlate with immunosuppression defined as CD4 count <350 cells/µL, higher ultrasensitive C-reactive protein and hepatitis C virus infection, and in contrast to the general population, they are not related to increased cardiovascular risk or metabolic syndrome. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav","AIDS;

Method A cross-sectional study was conducted involving patients with HIV/AIDS treated in a referral hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Eighty-eight adolescents (10-19 years of age) participated in the study. Information on disease history and use of medication were obtained from medical records. The participants responded to two 24-hour diet recalls. Diet quality was assessed by means of the Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005) adapted to the Brazilian population. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated. Mean HEI-2005 scores were compared according to the independent variables using either the Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney test. Results The mean HEI-2005 score was 51.90 (SE = 0.90). The components with the lowest means were whole grains and sodium. Components with highest means were total grains and oils. No correlations were found between the independent variables and HEI score. Adolescents living in foster homes had higher means for total fruit and lower means for meat and beans in comparison to adolescents living with their families. Girls had higher means for milk and lower means for calories from solid fats, alcoholic beverages, and added sugars in comparison to boys. Conclusions Adolescents with HIV/AIDS exhibited a similar eating pattern to that of adolescents in the general population: high consumption of added sugar, saturated fat, and sodium, and insufficient ingestion of whole grains and fruits. Special attention should be paid to the diet of adolescents with HIV/AIDS, who are at greater risk of developing cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. © 2014 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.","Adolescent; Food consumption; Healthy eating index; HIV/AIDS","Lumpkin, M., (1997) FDA Public Health Advisory: Reports of Diabetes and Hyperglycemia in Patients Receiving Protease Inhibitors for the Treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), , US Government Printing Office Washington, DC; Dos Reis, L.C., De Carvalho Rondó, P.H., De Sousa Marques, H.H., De Andrade, S.B., Dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance in vertically HIV-infected children and adolescents (2011) Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg., 105, pp. 197-203; Chandra, R.K., Nutrition and the immune system: An introduction (1997) Am J Clin Nutr., 66, pp. 460S-463S; Sharma, T.S., Kinnamon, D.D., Duggan, C., Weinberg, G.A., Furuta, L., Bechard, L., Changes in macronutrient intake among HIV-infected children between 1995 and 2004 (2008) Am J Clin Nutr., 88, pp. 384-391; Werner, M.L., Pone, M.V., Fonseca, V.M., Chaves, C.R., Lipodystrophy syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors in children and adolescents infected with HIV/AIDS receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (2010) J Pediatr (Rio J)., 86, pp. 27-32; Nielsen, S.J., Adair, L., An alternative to dietary data exclusions (2007) J Am Diet Assoc., 107, pp. 792-799; (2003) Brasil.

This article examines whether defendant and complaining witness demographic characteristics are associated with disparate outcomes under Michigan’s felony HIV disclosure statute, which makes it a crime for HIV-positive individuals to have sex without first disclosing their HIV-status. Despite indications nationwide that the number of defendants charged under HIV-specific criminal statutes (HSCS) is increasing, few empirical studies have examined their application. This study of HSCS convictions (N = 51) retrospectively observes and compares the risks of conviction under Michigan’s HSCS for particular HIV-positive subpopulations between 1992 and 2010. Overall, a comparatively greater risk of conviction was observed for black men with female partners and white women overall. Contrary to expectations, a comparatively low risk of conviction was observed for men with male partners as compared to men with female partners. While the observational methodology employed in this analysis cannot identify the causal mechanisms driving the observed disparities, the findings nonetheless suggest an uneven application of Michigan’s HIV disclosure law deserving of further inquiry. © The Author(s) 2014.","complainant; discrimination; HIV/AIDS; public health; risk","Alexander, M., (2010) The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, , New York: ; :, The New Press; (2005) Stonewalled: Police Abuse and Misconduct against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People in the U.S, , New York: ; :, Amnesty International; Baldus, D.C., Pulaski, C.A., Woodworth, G., Comparative review of death sentences: An empirical study of the Georgia experience (1983) Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology, 74 (3), pp. 661-753; Beckett, K., Nyop, K., Pfingst, L., Race, drugs, and policing: Understanding disparities in drug delivery arrests (2006) Criminology, 44 (1), pp. 105-137; Bernard, E.J., Nyambe, M., Criminal prosecutions for HIV non-disclosure, exposure and transmission: Overview and updated global ranking.

Typically, clinical presentation of visceral leishmaniasis includes chronic fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and weight loss. In Leishmania infantum endemic regions in Europe, atypical visceral leishmaniasis presentations have been well documented, with almost every possible organ involved. However, such reports are rare in Leishmania donovani endemic regions such as east Africa. In this Personal View, we describe the various atypical disease presentations in patients screened as part of an HIV and visceral leishmaniasis clinical trial in north Ethiopia, where up to 40% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis are co-infected with HIV. Atypical presentations such as these are not covered in clinical guidelines used in these settings. Apart from the lack of diagnostic facilities, this gap contributes to the underdiagnosis of atypical visceral leishmaniasis, with associated morbidity and mortality. Involvement of clinicians experienced with the management of HIV and visceral leishmaniasis co-infection in the development of HIV clinical guidelines in affected regions is warranted. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Marlier, S., Menard, G., Gisserot, O., Kologo, K., De Jaureguiberry, J.P., Leishmaniasis and human immunodeficiency virus: an emerging co-infection?

The main aims of this study were to assess the knowledge of and attitudes towards HIV/AIDS among dental assistants in Kuwait and to compare the knowledge and attitudes of dental assistants at Kuwait University Dental Center (KUDC) with those of dental assistants in Ministry of Health (MoH) hospitals. The secondary objective was to determine if any intervention was needed to provide more information to dental assistants on HIV/AIDS. A cross-sectional study was conducted by distributing questionnaires. The study sample included 85 dental assistants from each of KUDC and the MoH. The questionnaire included questions to assess the assistants' knowledge and attitude towards HIV/AIDS. Statistical data analysis was conducted using SPSS 20.0. Qualitative data were analysed using the Pearson chi-square text for any association or the Z-test for proportion to test the significance of differences. A total of 167 questionnaires were completed, returned and analysed. KUDC dental assistants were found to have significantly more knowledge about HIV/AIDS than their MoH counterparts, whereas the assistants at the MoH clinics displayed a more positive attitude towards patients with HIV/AIDS (P < 0.05). Although dental assistants at KUDC were more knowledgeable than those at the MoH clinics, there are still some misconceptions that need to be addressed, in addition to the negative attitudes displayed by some of the respondents. It would therefore be beneficial to increase awareness about HIV/AIDS patients through lectures, seminars and workshops targeting dental assistants. © 2014 FDI World Dental Federation.","attitudes; dental assistants; HIV/AIDS; knowledge; Kuwait","(2011) Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV/AIDS 2011-2015, , World Health Organization.

Bacillary angiomatosis affects individuals with advanced HIV disease or other immunocompromised individuals. In sub-Saharan Africa, despite the high prevalence of HIV infection and documentation of the causative Bartonella species in humans, mammalian hosts, and arthropod vectors, BA has only rarely been described. Methods: Three adult patients from Uganda and Kenya with deep purple dome-shaped papules or nodules of the skin underwent punch biopsies for histopathologic diagnosis. The biopsies of all 3 patients were sent to a local pathologist as well as to a dermatopathologist at the University of California, San Francisco. Results: All 3 patients were clinically suspected to have Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), and local pathologists had interpreted the lesions as KS in 2 of the cases and nonspecific inflammation in the third. Histologic examination by dermatopathologists in the United States revealed nodular dermal proliferations of irregular capillaries lined by spindled to epithelioid endothelial cells. The surrounding stroma contained a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Extracellular deposits of pale amphophilic granular material were noted in the surrounding stroma. A Warthin-Starry stain highlighted clumps of bacilli, confirming the diagnosis of BA. Conclusions: These 3 cases, to our knowledge, are the first reports of BA in East Africa in the biomedical literature. Each had been originally incorrectly diagnosed as KS. We speculate BA is underdiagnosed and underreported in resource-poor regions, such as sub- Saharan Africa, that have high endemic rates of HIV infection. © The Author(s) 2014.","Africa; bacillary angiomatosis; dermatology; HIV; Kaposi's sarcoma","Stoler, M.H., Bonfiglio, T.A., Steigbigel, R.T., Pereira, M., An atypical subcutaneous infection associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (1983) Am J Clin Pathol, 80 (5), pp. 714-718; Relman, D.A., Loutit, J.S., Schmidt, T.M., Falkow, S., Tompkins, L.S., The agent of bacillary angiomatosis.

We used a mathematical model to estimate the community-wide impact of targeting treatment and prevention to male migrants. Methods: We augmented an individual-based network model, EMOD-HIV v0.8, to include an age-dependent propensity for males to migrate. Migrants were exposed to HIV outside their home community, but continued to participate in HIV transmission in the community during periodic visits. Results: Migrant-targeted interventions would have been transformative in the 1980s to 1990s, but post-2015 impacts were more modest. When targetable migrants comprised 2% of adult males, workplace HIV prevention averted 3.5% of community-wide infections over 20 years. Targeted treatment averted 8.5% of all-cause deaths among migrants. When migrants comprised 10% of males, workplace prevention averted 16.2% of infections in the community, one-quarter of which were among migrants. Workplace prevention and treatment acted synergistically, averting 17.1% of community infections and 11.6% of deaths among migrants. These estimates do not include prevention of secondary spread of HIV or tuberculosis at the workplace. Conclusions: Though cost-effective, targeting migrants cannot collapse generalized epidemics in their home communities. Such a strategy would only have been possible prior to the early 1990s. However, migrant-targeted interventions synergize with general-population expansion of HIV services. © The Author 2015.","Epidemiology; HIV prevention; HIV/AIDS; Migration; Modeling; Southern Africa","Wilson, D., Halperin, D.T., 'Know your epidemic, know your response':a useful approach, if we get it right (2008) Lancet, 372, pp. 423-426; Ng, M., Gakidou, E., Levin-Rector, A., Assessment of population-level effect of Avahan, an HIV-prevention initiative in India (2011) Lancet, 378, pp. 1643-1652; Tanser, F., de Oliveira, T., Maheu-Giroux, M., Bärnighausen, T., (2014) Concentrated HIV subepidemics in generalized epidemic settings: Curr Opin HIVAIDS, 9, pp. 115-125; Scorgie, F., Chersich, M.F., Ntaganira, I., Socio-demographic characteristics and behavioral risk factors of female sex workers in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review (2012) AIDS Behav, 16, pp. 920-933; Bellan, S.E., Fiorella, K.J., Melesse, D.Y., Extra-couple HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa: a mathematical modelling study of survey data (2013) Lancet, 381, pp. 1561-1569; Hughes, J.P., Baeten, J.M., Lingappa, J.R., Determinants of percoital- act HIV-1 infectivity among African HIV-1-serodiscordant couples (2012) J Infect Dis, 205, pp. 358-365; Gray, R.H., Wawer, M.J., Probability of heterosexual HIV-1 transmission per coital act in sub-Saharan Africa (2012) J Infect Dis, 205, pp. 351-352; Mee, P., Collinson, M.A., Madhavan, S., Evidence for localised HIV related micro-epidemics associated with the decentralised provision of antiretroviral treatment in rural South Africa: a spatio-temporal analysis of changing mortality patterns (2007-2010) (2014) J Glob Health, 4, p. 010403. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4073250/, accessed 9 August 2014; Mishra, S., Steen, R., Gerbase, A., Impact of high-risk sex and focused interventions in heterosexual HIV epidemics: a systematic review of mathematical models (2012) PLoS ONE, 7, p. e50691; Aral, S.O., Cates, W., Coverage, context and targeted prevention:optimising our impact (2013) Sex Transm Infect, 89, pp. 336-340; Anarfi, J.K., Reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS: What role has migration?

Disclosure has numerous social and medical benefits for the child and family; however, disclosure rates tend to be low, especially in developing countries, and further understanding of the barriers is needed. This study describes the patterns and correlates of disclosure among HIV-infected children in southwestern Uganda. A cross-sectional study was conducted in a referral hospital pediatric HIV clinic between February and April 2012. Interviews were administered to caregivers of HIV-infected children aged 5-17 years. Data collected included socio-demographic characteristics of the child and caregiver, reported disclosure status, and caregivers' reasons for full disclosure or non-full disclosure of HIV status to their children. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was done to establish the socio-demographic correlates of disclosure. Caregivers provided data for 307 children; the median age was eight years (interquartile range [IQR] 7-11) and 52% were males. Ninety-five (31%) children had received full disclosure (48% of whom were >12 years), 22 children (7%) had received partial disclosure, 39 (13%) misinformation, and 151 (49%) no disclosure. Full disclosure was significantly more prevalent among the 9-11 and 12- to 17-year-olds compared to 5- to 8-year-olds (p-value < 0.001). The most frequently stated reason for disclosure was the hope that disclosure would improve medication adherence; the most frequently stated reason for nondisclosure was the belief that the child was too young to understand his/her illness. There was an inverse relationship between age and full disclosure and partial disclosure was rare across all age groups, suggesting a pattern of rapid, late disclosure. Disclosure programs should emphasize the importance of gradual disclosure, starting at younger ages, to maximize the benefits to the child and caregiver. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","AIDS; Children; Disclosure; HIV; Uganda","AAP, Disclosure of illness status to children and adolescents with HIV infection (1999) Pediatrics, 103, pp. 164-166; Biadgilign, S., Deribew, A., Amberbir, A., Escudero, H.R., Deribe, K., Factors associated with HIV/AIDS diagnostic disclosure to HIV infected children receiving HAART: A multi-center study in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2011) PLoS One, 6 (3), pp. 1-6; Bikaako-Kajura, W., Luyirika, E., Purcell, D.W., Downing, J., Kaharuza, F., Mermin, J., Bunnell, R., Disclosure of HIV status and adherence to daily drug regimens among HIV-infected children in Uganda (2006) AIDS Behavior, 10, pp. S85-S93; Biobele, J.B., Oladokun, R.E., Osinusi, K., Ochigbo, S., Adewole, I.F., Kanki, P., Disclosure of HIV status to infected children in a Nigerian HIV Care Programme (2011) AIDS Care, 23, pp. 1053-1058; Blasini, I., Chantry, C., Cruz, C., Ortiz, L., Salabarría, I., Scalley, N., Díaz, C., Disclosure model for pediatric patients living with HIV in Puerto Rico: Design, implementation, and evaluation (2004) Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, 25, pp. 181-189; Elise, A., France, A.M., Louise, W.M., Bata, D., François, R., Roger, S., Philippe, M., Assessment of adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy in a cohort of African HIV-infected children in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire (2005) Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, 40, pp. 498-500; Funck-Brentano, I., Costagliola, D., Patterns of disclosure and perceptions of the immunodeficiency virus in elementary school aged children (1997) Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescence Medicine, 151, pp. 978-985; Hardy, M.S., Routh, D.K., Armstrong, F.D., Albrecht, J., Davis, J., Interpersonal distance and coping in children with HIV and cancer (1995) Child Health Care Spring, 24 (2), pp. 119-131; Kallem, S., Renner, L., Ghebremichael, M., When children tell their friends they have AIDS: Possible consequences for psychological well-being and disease progression (2011) Psychosomatic Medicine, 62, pp. 238-247; Lester, P., Chesney, M., Cooke, M., Weiss, R., Whalley, P., Perez, B., Wara, D., When the time comes to talk about HIV: Factors associated with diagnostic disclosure and emotional distress in HIV-infected children (2002) Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, 31, pp. 309-317; Malobika, B., Anand, P.D., Mahesh, S., Patterns of diagnosis disclosure and its correlates in HIV-infected North Indian children (2011) Journal of Tropical Pediatrics, 57 (6), pp. 405-411; MOH-Uganda, (2005) Uganda National Policy Guidelines for HIV Counseling and Testing, , Kampala: Uganda; Sherman, B.F., Bonanno, G.A., Wiener, L.S., Battles, H.B., When children tell their friends they have AIDS: Possible consequences for psychological well-being and disease progression (2000) Psychosomatic Medicine, 62, pp. 238-247; UNAIDS, (2014) Global AIDS Epidemic Update Report, 2013, , Geneva: Author; Vaz, L.M.E., Eng, E., Maman, S., Tshikandu, T., Behets, F., Telling children they have HIV: Lessons learned from findings of a qualitative study in Sub-Saharan Africa (2010) AIDS Patient Care and STDs, 24, pp. 247-256; WHO, (2011) Guidelines on HIV Disclosure Counseling for Children up to 12 Years of Age, , Geneva: Author; Wiener, L., Mellins, C.A., Marhefka, S., Battles, H.B., Disclosure of an HIV diagnosis to children: History, current research, and future directions (2007) Journal of Development Behavior Pediatrics, 28, pp. 155-166",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923081380

Because older adults (aged ≥50 years) have particularly poor prognosis if they receive their diagnosis late in the course of HIV disease, any screening provided to younger adults in these venues should also be provided to older adults. We examined aging-related disparities in recent (past 12 months) and ever HIV testing in a probability sample of at-risk adults (N = 1238) seeking services in needle exchange sites, sexually transmitted disease clinics, and Latino community clinics that provide HIV testing. Using multiple logistic regression with generalized estimating equations, we estimated associations between age category (<50 years vs. ≥50 years) and each HIV testing outcome. Even after controlling for covariates such as recent injection drug use, older adults had 40% lower odds than younger adults did of having tested in the past 12 months (odds ratio [OR] = 0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.40-0.90) or ever (OR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.40-0.90). Aging-related disparities in HIV testing exist among clients of these high HIV prevalence venues and may contribute to known aging-related disparities in late diagnosis of HIV infection and poor long-term prognosis. © 2014 Taylor Francis.","Aging; AIDS serodiagnosis; Health services accessibility; HIV infections/diagnosis","Aday, L.A., Andersen, R.M., A framework for the study of access to medical care (1974) Health Services Research, 9 (3), pp. 208-220; Andersen, R.M., Revisiting the behavioral model and access to medical care: Does it matter?

Yet, to date, there has been surprisingly little empirical research investigating the role of social support as a resource for health in HIV-affected Southern African communities, despite the known importance of social connectedness, high rates of physical and mental health conditions, and existing 'treatment gaps'. Methods This paper brings together and discusses findings of multiple linked analyses, from the first large-scale explanatory sequential mixed methods research investigating the relationship between social support and health with caregiver populations in HIV-endemic South Africa. Results Overall, findings highlight the protective role of social support for caregiver mental health, the multiple perceived psychological and behavioural mechanisms possibly explaining the relationship between social support and both mental and physical health, and gender differences in the provision, effects, and availability of support. Conclusions Drawing from these findings and the broader literature, four potential foci for future research in Southern Africa are identified and discussed, as are implications for research design and methodologies. These involve achieving a better understanding of the following: The pathways and processes explaining common and differential effects of social support across different population groups; the potential protective role of social support for physical health; and the role of factors such as gender and social and cultural norms in shaping the relationship between social support and health. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Mental and physical health are closely related. HIV increases the risk of mental health conditions. Studies mainly from high-income countries have shown social relations and support to be protective of health. What does this study add? First mixed methods research of this dimension on social support and health in Southern Africa. Highlights importance of social support for mental health among caregivers of children in HIV-endemic South Africa. Points to biological and psychological pathways explaining the support-health relationship in this sample. © 2014 The British Psychological Society.","caregivers; HIV/AIDS; mental and physical health; social relations and social support; Southern Africa","Antelman, G., Kaaya, S., Wei, R., Mbwambo, J., Msamanga, G., Fawzi, W., Fawzi, M., Depressive symptoms increase risk of HIV disease progression and mortality among women in Tanzania (2007) Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, 44, pp. 470-477; Attride-Stirling, J., Thematic networks: An analytic tool for qualitative research (2001) Qualitative Research, 1, pp. 385-405; Baylies, C., The impact of AIDS on rural households in Africa: A shock like any other?

This study compared cancer diagnoses and survival among AIDS cases with AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs) to those with non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) in DC from 1996 to 2006. Survival by cancer type and time period was also examined for 300 individuals diagnosed with AIDS who developed cancer; 49% of AIDS cases developed an ADC. ADC cases were younger at both AIDS and cancer diagnosis and had significantly lower median CD4 counts at AIDS diagnosis than NADC cases. The most frequent cancers were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; 44% of ADC), Kaposi's sarcoma (40% of ADC), and lung cancer (20% of NADC). There was no significant difference in distribution of cancers when comparing ADCs to NADCs, or over time (1996-2001 vs. 2002-2006). Survival among NHL, oral cavity, and lung cancer cases was 0.4, 0.8, and 0.3 years, respectively; the risk of death was approximately two times higher for each of these cancers when compared to other cancers. Given the high burden of cancer and HIV in DC, early highly active antiretroviral therapy initiation, routine cancer screening, and risk reduction through behavioral modification should be emphasized to prevent cancer among HIV-infected persons. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","AIDS; cancer; HIV; mortality; survival","Barbaro, G., Barbarini, G., HIV infection and cancer in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (2007) Oncology Reports, 17, pp. 1121-1126; Biggar, R.J., Chaturvedi, A.K., Goedert, J.J., Engels, E.A., AIDS-related cancer and severity of immunosuppression in persons with AIDS (2007) Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 99, pp. 962-972; Biggar, R.J., Jaffe, E.S., Goedert, J.J., Chaturvedi, A., Pfeiffer, R., Engels, E.A., Hodgkin lymphoma and immunodeficiency in persons with HIV/AIDS (2006) Blood, 108, pp. 3786-3791; Bower, M., Palmieri, C., Dhillon, T., AIDS-related malignancies: Changing epidemiology and the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy (2006) Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases, 19 (1), pp. 14-19; 1993 revised classification system for HIV infection and expanded surveillance case definition for AIDS among adolescents and adults (1992) MMWR - Recommendations and Reports, 41, p. 17. , http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00018871.htm; (2010) Cervical Cancer Rates by State, , http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/statistics/state.htm; (2013) HIV Surveillance Report, 2011, 23. , http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/resources/reports/, Retrieved June 2013; Chaturvedi, A.K., Pfeiffer, R.M., Chang, L., Goedert, J.J., Biggar, R.J., Engels, E.A., Elevated risk of lung cancer among people with AIDS (2007) AIDS, 21, pp. 207-213; Cinti, S.K., Gandhi, T., Riddell, J.T., Non-AIDS-defining cancers: Should antiretroviral therapy be initiated earlier?

Study Design and Setting: Retrospective population-based observational study from April 1, 2009, to March 31, 2012. A total of 13,480 eligible patients with HIV and receiving publicly funded health care in Ontario. We derived a typology of care by linking patients to usual family physicians and to HIV specialists with five possible patterns of care. Patient and physician characteristics and outpatient visits for HIV-related and non-HIV-related care were used to assess the robustness and characteristics of the typology. Results: Five possible patterns of care were described as low engagement (8.6%), exclusively primary care (52.7%), family physician-dominated comanagement (10.0%), specialist-dominated comanagement (30.5%), and exclusively specialist care (5.2%). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated robustness of typology assignments. Visit patterns varied in ways that conform to typology assignments. Conclusion: We anticipate this typology can be used to assess the impact of care patterns on the quality of primary care for people living with HIV. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Chronic disease; Comorbidity; Health services delivery; HIV/AIDS; Human immunodeficiency virus; Integrated care; Primary health care; Shared care",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925863237

Past studies report the clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of expanded HIV testing nationally and within clinics but have not examined how state policies affect resource needs and epidemic outcomes. Methods: A system dynamics model of HIV testing and care was developed, where disease progression and transmission differ by awareness of HIV status, engagement in care, and disease stage. Data sources include HIV surveillance, Medicaid claims, and literature. The model projected how alternate implementation scenarios would change new infections, diagnoses, linkage to care, and living HIV cases over 10 years. Results: Without the law, the model projects declining new infections, newly diagnosed cases, individuals newly linked to care, and fraction of undiagnosed cases (reductions of 62.8%, 59.7%, 54.1%, and 57.8%) and a slight increase in living diagnosed cases and individuals in care (2.2% and 6.1%). The law will further reduce new infections, diagnosed AIDS cases, and the fraction undiagnosed and initially increase and then decrease newly diagnosed cases. Outcomes were consistent across scenarios with different testing offer frequencies and implementation times but differed according to the level of implementation. Conclusions: A mandatory offer of HIV testing may increase diagnoses and avert infections but will not eliminate the epidemic. Despite declines in new infections, previously diagnosed cases will continue to need access to antiretroviral therapy, highlighting the importance of continued funding for HIV care. © 2015 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Computer simulation; HIV; Policy evaluation; Screening",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920859464

The incidence of toxoplasmic encephalitis between the periods before and after the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) was compared. Toxoplasmic encephalitis was diagnosed in 21 patients. In those patients the geometric mean value of CD4+ T lymphocytes was 12·6 times lower than in patients with non-reactivated T. gondii infection but an additionally significant decline in CD8+ T lymphocytes (3·3-fold) and natural killer cells (4·3-fold) was observed. This confirms the significance of these parameters. A twelvefold decrease in Toxoplasma reactivation incidence (40·2 vs. 3·4/1000 person-years) between monitored periods was seen.

Brasil 4365Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Background: In 1996, Brazil became the first developing country to provide free, universal access to HAART, laboratory monitoring, and clinical care to any eligible patient. As of June 2014, approximately 400,000 patients were under treatment, making it the most comprehensive HIV treatment initiative implemented thus far in a middle-income country, worldwide. The Brazilian epidemic is highly concentrated among men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods: Four national information systems were combined and Cox regression was used to conduct retrospective cohort analysis of HAART availability/access on all-cause mortality among MSM diagnosed with AIDS reported to the information systems between 1998-2008, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors and controlling for spatially-correlated survival data by including a frailty effect. Multiple imputation by chained equations was used to handle missing data. Results: Among 50,683 patients, 10,326 died during the 10 year of period. All-cause mortality rates declined following introduction of HAART, and were higher among non-white patients and those starting HAART with higher viral load and lower CD4 counts. In multivariable analysis adjusted for race, age at AIDS diagnosis, and baseline CD4 cell count, MSM diagnosed in latter periods had almost a 50% reduction in the risk of death, compared to those diagnosed between 1998-2001 (2002-2005 adjHR: 0.54, 95% CI:0.51-0.57; 2006-2008 adjHR: 0.51, 95% CI:0.48-0.55). After controlling for spatially correlated survival data, mortality remained higher among those diagnosed in the earliest diagnostic cohort and lower among non-white patients and those starting HAART with higher viral load and lower CD4 lymphocyte counts. Conclusions: Universal and free access to HAART has helped achieve impressive declines in AIDS mortality in Brazil. However, after a 10-years follow-up, differential AIDS-related mortality continue to exist. Efforts are needed to identify and eliminate these health disparities, therefore improving the Brazilian response towards HIV/AIDS epidemic. © 2015 Malta et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","AIDS; Brazil; HAART (Highly active antiretroviral therapy); HIV; Men who have sex with men (MSM); Survival analysis","(2014) The GAP Report, , UNAIDS Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS Geneva; Van Sighem, A.I., Gras, L.A., Reiss, P., Brinkman, K., De Wolf, F., ATHENA national observational cohort study.

Because A3H is genetically divergent with different intracellular stability and anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro, we investigated a possible association of A3H with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and disease progression in Japanese populations. A total of 191 HIV-1-infected individuals (HIV group), 93 long-term non-progressors to AIDS (LTNP group) and 421 healthy controls were genotyped for two functional APOBEC3H polymorphisms, rs139292 and rs139297. As compared with the controls, minor allele frequency (MAF) for rs139292 was high in the HIV group (MAF in cases vs. controls; 0.322 vs. 0.263, odds ratio (OR) = 1.33, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) = 1.02–1.74, p = 0.035) and low in the LTNP group (0.161 vs. 0.263, OR = 0.54, 95 % CI = 0.36–0.82, p = 0.004, pc = 0.007), whereas the MAF for rs139297 was high in the HIV group (0.367 vs. 0.298, OR = 1.36, 95 % CI = 1.07–1.76, p = 0.017, pc = 0.035). In addition, haplotype analyses revealed that the frequencies of A3H-hapC and -hapA were high (0.322 vs. 0.262, OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.02–1.74, p = 0.003) and low (0.634 vs. 0.697, OR = 0.75, 95 % CI = 0.58–0.97, p = 0.002), respectively, in the HIV group, whereas the frequencies of A3H-hapC and -hapB were low (0.161 vs. 0.262, OR = 0.54, 95 % CI = 0.36–0.82, p = 0.00003) and high (0.097 vs. 0.040, OR = 2.55, 95 % CI = 1.40–4.62, p = 0.000008), respectively, in the LTNP group, as compared with those in the controls. These observations suggest that the A3H with low anti-HIV-1 activity, A3H-hapC, is associated with the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, whereas the A3H producing a stable protein, A3H-hapB, may confer a low risk of disease progression to AIDS. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","AIDS progression;

Many men (67.8%) had both casual and regular partners, sex with other men (8.7%), and commercial sex (33.1%). Factors associated with having HIV included reporting a genital ulcer (odds ratio [OR] =2.4, 95% CI 1.4–4.4), drinking alcohol during last sex (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1–3.7), having 4–6 lifetime partners (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0–4.8), and having one’s last female partner be >24 years of age (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2–6.6). Independent predictors of HIV included age ≥31 (adjusted OR (aOR) 5.8, 95% CI 1.5–48.5), having 4–6 partners (aOR 2.2, 95%CI 1.0–5.1), and self-report of a genital ulcer (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2–4.1). Only 39.2% of men were circumcised, and 36.9% had been HIV tested in the past. Male boda-boda drivers have a higher prevalence of HIV than the general population, and low frequency of preventive behaviours, such as circumcision and HIV testing. Targeted and intensified interventions for this group are warranted. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav","Africa; AIDS; boda-boda; epidemiology; HIV; Men; prevalence; screening; sexually transmitted infections; taxi drivers; transportation; Uganda","(2012) Uganda AIDS indicator survey 2011, , Kampala: ; :, Ministry of Health; (2006) Uganda HIV/AIDS sero-behavioural survey 2004–2005, , Kampala, Uganda: ; :, Ministry of Health and ORC Macro; Kim, A.A., Hallett, T., Stover, J., Estimating HIV incidence among adults in Kenya and Uganda: a systematic comparison of multiple methods (2011) PLoS One, 6, p. 17535. , ,,, et al.. ;:-; Hladik, W., Barker, J., Ssenkusu, J.M., HIV Infection among men who have sex with men in Kampala, Uganda – a respondent driven sampling Survey (2012) PLoS One, 7, p. 38143. , ,,, et al.. ;:-; Asiki, G., Mpendo, J., Abaasa, A., HIV and syphilis prevalence and associated risk factors among fishing communities of Lake Victoria, Uganda (2011) Sex Transm Infect, 87, pp. 511-515. , ,,, et al.. ;:-; Pandey, A., Benara, S.K., Roy, N., Risk behaviour, sexually transmitted infections and HIV among long-distance truck drivers: a cross-sectional survey along national highways in India (2008) AIDS, 22, pp. 81-90. , ,,, et al.. ;:-; Malta, M., Bastos, F.I., Pereira-Koller, E.M., A qualitative assessment of long distance truck drivers' vulnerability to HIV/AIDS in Itajai, southern Brazil (2006) AIDS Care, 18, pp. 489-496. , ,,, et al.. ;:-; Atilola, G.O., Akpa, O.M., Komolafe, I.O., HIV/AIDS and the long-distance truck drivers in south-west Nigeria: a cross-sectional survey on the knowledge, attitude, risk behaviour and beliefs of truckers (2010) J Infect Public Health, 3, pp. 166-178; Ferguson, A.G., Morris, C.N., Mapping transactional sex on the Northern Corridor highway in Kenya (2007) Health Place, 13, pp. 504-519; Sunmola, A.M., Sexual practices, barriers to condom use and its consistent use among long distance truck drivers in Nigeria (2005) AIDS Care, 17, pp. 208-221; Delany-Moretlwe, S., Bello, B., Kinross, P., HIV prevalence and risk in long-distance truck drivers in South Africa: a national cross-sectional survey (2014) Int J STD AIDS, 25, pp. 428-438. , ,,, et al.. ;:-; Morris, C.N., Morris, S.R., Ferguson, A.G., Sexual behavior of female sex workers and access to condoms in Kenya and Uganda on the Trans-Africa highway (2009) AIDS Behav, 13, pp. 860-865; Morisky, D.E., Nguyen, C., Ang, A., HIV/AIDS prevention among the male population: results of a peer education program for taxicab and tricycle drivers in the Philippines (2005) Health Educ Behav, 32, pp. 57-68. , ,,, et al.. ;:-; Gorbach, P.M., Sopheab, H., Phalla, T., Sexual bridging by Cambodian men: potential importance for general population spread of STD and HIV epidemics (2000) Sex Transm Dis, 27, pp. 320-326. , ,,, et al.. ;:-; Adeoye, S., Sexual behaviour, perception of HIV/AIDS and condom use among commercial motorcylists in Benin City (2005) Niger Postgrad Med J, 12, pp. 262-265; Ekanem, E.E., Afolabi, B.M., Nuga, A.O., Sexual behaviour, HIV-related knowledge and condom use by intra-city commercial bus drivers and motor park attendants in Lagos, Nigeria (2005) Afr J Reprod Health, 9, pp. 78-87. , ,,, et al.. ;:-; Roy, T., Anderson, C., Evans, C., Sexual risk behaviour of rural-to-urban migrant taxi drivers in Dhaka, Bangladesh: a cross-sectional behavioural survey (2010) Public Health, 124, pp. 648-658. , ,,, et al.. ;:-; Heckathorn, D.D., Snowball versus respondent driven sampling (2011) Sociol Methodol, 41, pp. 355-366; Johnston, L.G., Malekinejad, M., Kendall, C., Implementation challenges to using respondent-driven sampling methodology for HIV biological and behavioral surveillance: field experiences in international settings (2008) AIDS Behav, 12, pp. 131-141. , ,,, et al.. ;:-; Gomes do Espirito Santo, M.E., Etheredge, G.D., Male clients of brothel prostitutes as a bridge for HIV infection between high risk and low risk groups of women in Senegal (2005) Sex Transm Infect, 81, pp. 342-344; Strand, C., Kill Bill!

Lactotransferrin is present in the breast milk and in the female genitourinary mucosa and it has been hypothesised as a possible candidate to prevent mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission. To verify if two functional polymorphisms, Thr29Ala and Arg47Lys, in the lactotransferrin encoding gene (LTF) could affect HIV-1 infection and vertical transmission, a preliminary association study was performed in 238 HIV-1 positive and 99 HIV-1 negative children from Brazil, Italy, Africa and India. No statistically significant association for the Thr29Ala and Arg47Lys LTF polymorphisms and HIV-1 susceptibility in the studied populations was found. Additionally LTF polymorphisms frequencies were compared between the four different ethnic groups. © 2015, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

Methods: Strategies used were mobile HTC (MHTC) and home-based HTC (HBHTC). Information on age, sex, previous testing and HIV results was obtained from routine HTC records. A consecutive series of individuals testing HIV-positive were followed up for 6 months from the test date to assess linkage to care. Results: A total of 9 060 people were tested: 2 034 through MHTC and 7 026 through HBHTC. A higher proportion of children and adolescents (<20 years) were tested through HBHTC than MHTC (57% vs. 17%; P < 0.001). MHTC reached a higher proportion of adult men than HBHTC (42% vs. 39%; P = 0.015). Of 398 HIV-positive individuals, only 135 (34%) were enrolled in HIV care within 6 months. Of 42 individuals eligible for antiretroviral therapy, 22 (52%) started treatment within 6 months. Linkage to care was lowest among people who had tested previously and those aged 20-40 years. HBHTC was 50% cheaper (US$11 per person tested; $797 per individual enrolled in HIV care) than MHTC ($24 and $1698, respectively). Conclusion: In this high HIV prevalence setting, a community-based testing programme achieved high uptake of testing and appears to be an effective and affordable way to encourage large numbers of people to learn their HIV status (particularly underserved populations such as men and young people). However, for community HTC to impact mortality and incidence, strategies need to be implemented to ensure people testing HIV-positive in the community are linked to HIV care. © 2015 The Authors.","AIDS; Community-based interventions; HIV diagnosis and management; HIV prevention; HIV testing and counselling",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926443677

We developed a system dynamics simulation model of the HIV testing and care system to help administrators understand the law's potential epidemic impact, resource needs, strategies to improve implementation, and appropriate outcome indicators for future policy evaluations once postlaw data become available. Policy modeling allowed us to synthesize information from numerous sources including quantitative administrative data sets and practitioners' content expertise, structure the information to be viewed both numerically and visually, and organize consensus for decisionmaking purposes. This case illustrates how policy modeling can provide an integrated framework for administrators to examine policy problems in complex systems, particularly when data time lags limit pre-post comparisons and key outcomes cannot be measured directly. © 2014 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.",,"Castilla, J., del Romero, J., Hernando, V., Marincovich, B., Garcia, S., Rodriguez, C., Effectiveness of highly active antiretroviral therapy in reducing heterosexual transmission of HIV (2005) Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, 40, pp. 96-101; Revised recommendations for HIV testing of adults, adolescents, and pregnant women in health-care settings (2006) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 55, pp. 1-17. , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); HIV prevalence estimates-United States, 2006 (2008) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 57, pp. 1073-1076; Revised surveillance case definitions for HIV infection among adults, adolescents, and children aged <18 months and for HIV infection and AIDS among children aged 18 months to <13 years-United States, 2008 (2008) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 57, pp. 1-13; Vital signs: HIV prevention through care and treatment-United States (2011) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 60, pp. 1618-1623; Cheever, L.W., Engaging HIV-infected patients in care: Their lives depend on it (2007) Clinical Infectious Diseases, 52, pp. 1046-1049; Chou, R., Selph, S., Dana, T., Bougatsos, C., Zakher, B., Blazina, I., Korthuis, P.T., Screening for HIV: Systematic review to update the 2005 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation (2012) Annals of Internal Medicine, 157, pp. 706-718; Cohen, M.S., Chen, Y.Q., McCauley, M., Gamble, T., Hosseinipour, M.C., Kumarasamy, N., Fleming, T.R., Prevention of HIV-1 infection with early antiretroviral therapy (2011) New England Journal of Medicine, 365, pp. 493-505; Forrester, J.W., (1961) Industrial dynamics, , Cambridge, MA: Productivity Press; Forrester, J.W., Information sources for modeling the national economy (1980) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 75, pp. 555-574; Gardner, E.M., McLees, M.P., Steiner, J.F., del Rio, C., Burman, W.J., The spectrum of engagement in HIV care and its relevance to test-and-treat strategies for prevention of HIV infection (2011) Clinical Infectious Diseases, 52, pp. 793-800; Gelles, G.M., Costs and benefits of HIV-1 antibody testing of donated blood (1993) Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 12, pp. 512-531; Ghaffarzadegan, N., Andersen, D.F., Modeling behavioral complexities of warning issuance for domestic security: A simulation approach to develop public management theories (2012) International Public Management Journal, 15, pp. 337-363; Ghaffarzadegan, N., Lyneis, J., Richardson, G.P., How small system dynamics models can help the public policy process (2011) System Dynamics Review, 27, pp. 22-44; Greenberger, M., Crenson, M.A., Crissey, B.L., (1976) Models in the policy process: Public decision making in the computer era, , New York: Russell Sage Foundation; Heckman, T.G., Somlai, A.M., Peters, J., Walker, J., Otto-Salaj, L., Galdabini, C.A., Kelly, J.A., Barriers to care among persons living with HIV/AIDS in urban and rural areas (1998) AIDS Care, 10, pp. 365-375; Homer, J.B., Clair St, C.L., A model of HIV transmission through needle sharing (1991) Interfaces, 21, pp. 26-49; (2005) Public financing and delivery of HIV/AIDS care: Securing the legacy of Ryan White, , DC: National Academies Press; (2012) Monitoring HIV care in the United States: A strategy for generating national estimates of HIV care and coverage, , DC: The National Academies Press; (2012) Monitoring HIV care in the United States: Indicators and data systems, , DC: The National Academies Press; Kahn, J.G., Marseille, E.A., A saga in international HIV policy modeling: Preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission (2002) Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 21, pp. 499-505; Kim, H., MacDonald, R.M., Andersen, D.F., Simulation and managerial decision-making: A double-loop learning framework (2013) Public Administration Review, 73, pp. 291-300; Marks, G., Crepaz, N., Senterfitt, J.W., Janssen, R.S., Meta-analysis of high-risk sexual behavior in persons aware and unaware they are infected with HIV in the United States: Implications for HIV prevention programs (2005) Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, 39, pp. 446-453; Marks, G., Crepaz, N., Janssen, R.S., Estimating sexual transmission of HIV from persons aware and unaware that they are infected with the virus in the USA (2006) AIDS, 20, pp. 1447-1450; Martin, E.G., Paltiel, A.D., Walensky, R.P., Schackman, B.R., Expanded HIV screening in the United States: What will it cost government discretionary and entitlement programs?

We postulated that inflammation-associated biomarkers will be associated with cerebral injury on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in chronically HIV-infected subjects. Methods: Five biomarkers were measured in 197 HIV-infected subjects: soluble CD14, MCP-1, IP-10, MIP-1β, and fractalkine. Levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), Choline (Cho), Myoinositol (MI), Glutamate + Glutamine (Glx), and Creatine (Cr) were acquired in the midfrontal cortex (MFC), frontal white matter, and basal ganglia (BG). Predictive models were built through linear regression, and the best models were chosen using the Akaike Information Criterion. Results: Increases in plasma or CSF MCP-1 were associated with lower NAA/Cr in the MFC and BG, whereas metabolite changes in the frontal white matter for NAA/Cr, GlxCr, and Cho/Cr were explained almost exclusively by a single factor, sCD14. Plasma and CSF levels of this factor were also significantly associated with Glx/Cr in MFC and BG. Higher CSF FKN was associated with higher NAA/Cr in BG. Best predictors for higher Cho/Cr in BG and MFC were CSF sCD14 and CSF MIP-1β. Plasma and CSF IP-10 were only associated with Cho/Cr in MFC. Of the 3 models that simultaneously accounted for both plasma and CSF, there were more associations between CSF biomarkers and magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolites. Conclusions: Markers of inflammation and immune activation, in particular MCP-1 and sCD14, predominantly reflecting CNS sources, contribute to the persistence of brain injury in a metabolite and region-dependent manner in chronically HIV-infected patients on stable combination antiretroviral therapy.

This study examined risky sexual behaviors and associated factors that may lead to increased HIV infection vulnerability among migrant laborers in Metema District, Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from July 8-18, 2013 at farms with migrant laborers. We enrolled 756 participants through multistage random sampling. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and analyzed using EPI Info7; bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed using SPSS. Results: 582 (77%) migrant workers had sexual intercourse in their lifetime. 68% (397/582) reported non-marital sexual intercourse in the preceding six months. Of these, 74% reported sexual intercourse with commercial sex workers, 49% reported having transactional sex, 49% reported unprotected sexual intercourse with CSWs, 69% reported multiple sexual partners in the preceding six months (mean = 2.9 ± 0.7). Being aged between 20-29 (AOR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.16, 3.99) and 30 years or older (AOR = 2.51, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.71), receipt of HIV prevention information in the preceding six months (AOR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.15, 2.63), and staying longer on the farm (AOR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.46, 5.14) were factors significantly associated with condom use at last non-marital sexual intercourse. Respondents aged ≤19, not receiving HIV information in the preceding six months, or staying on the farm for ≤2 months were less likely to have used condoms at their last non-marital sexual intercourse. Moreover, having daily income above USD 5.00 (AOR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.14, 4.41), paying for most recent sexual intercourse (AOR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.36, 3.61), and drinking alcohol during last sexual intercourse (AOR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.83) were significantly associated with having multiple (≥2) sexual partners during the preceding six months. Conclusions: Seasonal laborers commonly exhibit risky sexual behaviors likely to increase their vulnerability to HIV infection. Unprotected and multiple sex partners in these populations pose transmission risks to seasonal laborers and onward to their wives and future sexual partners. The findings support the need for targeted HIV prevention campaigns designed for seasonal workers and their sexual partners. © 2015 Tiruneh et al.","HIV/AIDS; Northwest ethiopia; Seasonal workers; Sexual behaviors; Vulnerability","(2011) Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey, , CSA and ICF international, Addis Ababa; Woldie, A., Degefa, T., Gete, Z., Causes and impacts of seasonal migration on rural livelihoods: Case studies from Amhara Region, Ethiopia (2010) Norwegian J Geogr, 64, pp. 58-70; Yves, G., Mohamud, U., (1999) UN-Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia Underdeveloped, Drought Prone, Food Insecure: Reflections on Living Conditions in Parts of the Simien Mountains, , United Nations Development Program Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia (UNDP-EUE); Newton, I.K., Taha, E.T., Donald, R.H., Diane, M., George, N.L., John, D.C., HIV prevalence and risk factors for men at a sugar state (2001) Sex Transm Dis, 29 (6), pp. 366-371; Brummer, D., (2002) Labour Migration and HIV/AIDS in Southern Africa (IOM.OIM); Brockerhoff, M., Biddlecom, A.E., Migration, Sexual behavior and the risk of HIV in Kenya (1999) Int Migrat Rev, 33 (4), pp. 833-856; Wolffers, I., Fernandez, I., Verghis, S., Vink, M., Sexual behavior and vulnerability of migrant workers for HIV infection (2004) Cult Health Sex, 4 (4), pp. 459-473; Saggurti, N., Mahapatra, B., Swain, S.N., Jain, A.K., Male migration and risky sexual behavior in rural India: Is the place of origin critical for HIV prevention programs?

Using longitudinal household survey data from Western Kenya, we estimate the effects of health status on investments in soil quality, as indicated by households' agricultural land fallowing decisions. We first show that this effect is theoretically ambiguous: while health improvements lower discount rates and thus increase incentives to conserve natural resources, they also increase labor productivity and make it more likely that households can engage in labor-intensive resource extraction activities. We find that household size and composition are predictors of whether the effect of health improvements on discount rates dominates the productivity effect, or vice-versa. Since households with more and younger members are better able to reallocate labor to cope with productivity shocks, the discount rate effect dominates for these households and health improvements lead to greater levels of conservation. In smaller families with less substitutable labor, the productivity effect dominates and health improvements lead to greater environmental degradation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Environmental degradation; Health and environment; Health shocks; HIV/AIDS","Beegle, K., De Weerdt, J., Dercon, S., Orphanhood and human capital destruction: ts there persistence into adulthood?

Nowadays, fat loss at the lower part of buttocks has become another problem as patients have started to complain that it is painful to be seated for a long time and/or on hard surfaces. We developed a method for buttock lipoatrophy treatment with PMMA-microspheres, as silicone prostheses and autologous fat transplant were not completely efficient. The treatment consisted of net-crossed injections, in the subcutaneous layer, of a 30% PMMA-microspheres solution on the atrophic areas of the buttock. One hundred and fifty-four patients were included. The amount of PMMA-microspheres used to treat buttock lipoatrophy depended on the degree of atrophy and size of the area to be treated. Patients were satisfied with this treatment and reported to be more comfortable to be seated for longer period of time. We demonstrated that soft tissue augmentation with PMMA-microspheres is safe and efficient for the treatment of buttock lipoatrophy associated with HIV lipodystrophy. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","AIDS; antiretroviral therapy; buttocks; HIV; HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome; lipoatrophy; lipodystrophy; polymethyl methacrylate; toxicity; treatment","Caron-Debarle, M., Lagathu, C., Boccara, F., HIV-associated lipodystrophy: from fat injury to premature aging (2010) Trends Mol Med, 16, pp. 218-229. , ,,, et al.. ;:-; Serra, M., Gonçalves, L.Z., Gontijo, S.G., Treatment of HIV-related facial and body lipodystrophy with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA): 10 years experience.

Atorvastatin showed anti-immune activation effects among HIV-infected cART-naïve individuals. We investigated whether adjunct atorvastatin therapy reduces T-cell activation among cART-treated adults with suboptimal immune recovery. Methods: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial, of atorvastatin 80 mg daily vs. placebo for 12 weeks, was conducted among individuals with CD4 increase <295 cells/μl after seven years of suppressive cART. Change in T-cell activation (CD3 + CD4 + /CD8 + CD38 + HLADR+) and in T-cell exhaustion (CD3 + CD4 + /CD8 + PD1 + ) was measured using flow cytometry. Results: Thirty patients were randomised, 15 to each arm. Atorvastatin resulted in a 28% greater reduction in CD4 T-cell activation (60% reduction) than placebo (32% reduction); P = 0.001. Atorvastatin also resulted in a 35% greater reduction in CD8-T-cell activation than placebo (49% vs. 14%, P = 0.0009), CD4 T-cell exhaustion (27% vs. 17% in placebo), P = 0.001 and CD8 T-cell exhaustion (27% vs. 16%), P = 0.004. There was no carry-over/period effect. Expected adverse events were comparable in both groups, and no serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Atorvastatin reduced T-cell immune activation and exhaustion among cART-treated adults in a Ugandan cohort. Atorvastatin adjunct therapy should be explored as a strategy to improve HIV treatment outcomes among people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Adjunct therapy; Antiretroviral therapy;

To develop therapeutic and preventive approaches against the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS, it is essential to understand the mechanisms of interaction between the virus and the host, involvement of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, characterization of viral reservoirs, and factors influencing the latency of the virus. Both methylation of viral genes and histone modifications contribute to initiating and maintaining latency and, depending on the context, triggering viral gene repression or expression. This chapter discusses progress made at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), recommendations from the International AIDS Society Scientific Working Group on HIV Cure, and underlying epigenetic regulation. A number of epigenetic inhibitors have shown potential in treating AIDS-related malignancies. Epigenetic drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and their implications for the eradication of HIV/AIDS and AIDS-related malignancies also are discussed. Past and current progress in developing treatments and understanding the molecular mechanisms of AIDS and HIV infection has greatly improved patient survival. However, increased survival has been coupled with the development of cancer at higher rates than those observed among the HIV/AIDSnegative population. During the early days of the AIDS epidemic, the most frequent AIDS-defining malignancies were Kaposi’s sarcoma and non- Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Now, with increased survival as the result of widespread use in the developed world of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), non- AIDS defining cancers (i.e., anal, skin, and lung cancers, and Hodgkin disease) are on the increase in HIVinfected populations. The current status of AIDS- related malignancies also is discussed. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.","AIDS; Cancer; Epigenetics; HIV; Methylation; Prevention; Risk assessment treatment","Ablashi, D.V., Bernbaum, J., Dipaolo, J.A., Human herpesvirus 6 as a potential copathogen (1995) Trends Microbiol, 3, pp. 324-327; Lewis, B.P., Burge, C.B., Bartel, D.P., Conserved seed pairing, often fl anked by adenosines, indicates that thousands of human genes are microRNA targets (2005) Cell, 120, pp. 15-20; Grimson, A., Farh, K.K., Johnston, W.K., Garrett- Engele, P., Lim, L.P., Bartel, D.P., MicroRNA targeting specifi city in mammals: Determinants beyond seed pairing (2007) Mol Cell, 27, pp. 91-105; Esteller, M., Epigenetics in cancer (2008) N Engl J Med, 358, pp. 1148-1159; Esteller, M., Cancer epigenetics for the 21st century: What’s next?

Although the structure of individual rights that underlies the law of sexual assault is conceptually distinct from norms produced through governmental power, this article shows that it is often difficult to draw clear distinctions between the two. An analysis that focuses strictly on individual rights is unsatisfactory because it fails to account for the social nature of our expectations of responsibility and trust. At the same time, when the individual right derives its content by absorbing a norm produced through governmental power, it fails to provide a principled discourse for future decision – making. © The Author(s) 2014.","Canada; criminal law; governmentality; HIV and AIDS; rights; sexual assault","Berkowitz, R., (2003) Stayin’ Alive, , Boulder, CO: ; :, Westview Pre;; Buell, S., Novel criminal fraud (2006) New York University Law Review, 81, pp. 1971-2043; Castelle, R., (1991) The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality, pp. 281-298. , Burchell GGordon CMiller P, ed.

The principal forms of intestinal parasitic infections in non-immunocompromised patients include cryptosporiosis, isosporidiosis and microsporidiosis, whereas strongyloidiasis, leishmaniasis and toxoplasmosis are the most important causes of parasitic systemic infections reported in HIV-infected patients. It has been shown that parasitic infections could simulate HIV replication and accelerate disease progression. In developing countries, malaria and HIV overlap geographically.

CD4 and CD8 T cell values and CD4:CD8 ratios were compared between groups. In all, 144 men, aged 18–50 years, were included in the analysis. Twenty were diagnosed with neurocognitive impairment. We were unable to identify any significant difference between current, nadir or peak CD4 and CD8 counts. CD4:CD8 ratios and CD4:CD8 ratio inversion (<1) were also found to be similar between both groups. However, neurocognitive impairment subjects were 8% more likely to have inversion of CD4:CD8 ratio and higher median peak CD8 cell counts reported compared to non-impaired subjects. Analysis of data from the MSM Neurocog Study, demonstrated trends in peripheral CD8 counts and CD4:CD8 ratios. However, we are unable to demonstrate any significant benefit. Plasma biomarkers of neurocognitive impairment in HIV-infected subjects would be of great benefit over current methods of invasive CSF analysis and technical neuroimaging used in the diagnosis of neurocognitive impairment. Future, prospective, longitudinal work with large numbers of neurocognitive impairment subjects is required to further investigate the role of peripheral CD8 T cells as markers of neurocognitive impairment. © The Author(s) 2014.","AIDS; CD4:CD8 ratio; CD8 T cells; HIV; neurocognitive impairment","Dore, G.J., Correll, P.K., Li, Y., Changes to AIDS dementia complex in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (1999) AIDS, 13, pp. 1249-1253. , ,,, et al.. ;:-; Simioni, S., Cavassini, M., Annoni, J.M., Cognitive dysfunction in HIV patients despite long-standing suppression of viremia (2010) AIDS, 24, pp. 1243-1250. , ,,, et al.. ;:-; Heaton, R.K., Clifford, D.B., Franklin, D.R., HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders persist in the era of potent antiretroviral therapy: CHARTER Study (2010) Neurology, 75, pp. 2087-2096. , ,,, et al.. ;:-; (2012) Version 6, 1, pp. 48-89. , European AIDS Clinical Society.

We report an atypical case of primary HIV-1 infection with HIV-1 subtype C in a 61-year old Caucasian man who presented with extreme hyperferritinaemia without iron overload and marked elevation of serum creatine kinase without rhabdomyolysis. In view of his symptomatic seroconversion and low baseline CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, the patient was treated promptly with combination antiretroviral therapy. Subsequently, he made good clinical improvement on treatment and no opportunistic infections were diagnosed at presentation or as part of a later immune reconstitution syndrome. This novel case highlights the importance of clinical suspicion of HIV and suggests that primary HIV-1 infection should be considered in patients presenting with severe hyperferritinaemia or markedly elevated creatine kinase levels.

Estimates of HIV prevalence in African military personnel are scarce and inconsistent. We conducted a serosurvey between June and September 2007 among 4043 Armed Forces personnel of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) stationed in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to determine the prevalence of HIV and syphilis infections and describe associated risk behaviours. Participants provided blood for HIV and syphilis testing and responded to a demographic and risk factor questionnaire. The prevalence of HIV was 3.8% and the prevalence of syphilis was 11.9%. Women were more likely than men to be HIV positive, (7.5% vs. 3.6% respectively, aOR: 1.66, 95% C.I: 1.21–2.28, p < 0.05). Factors significantly associated with HIV infection included gender and self-reported genital ulcers in the 12 months before date of enrollment. The prevalence of HIV in the military appears to be higher than the general population in DRC (3.8% vs. 1.3%, respectively), with women at increased risk of infection. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav","Africa; AIDS; epidemiology; HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus); prevalence; sexual behaviour; syphilis (Treponema pallidum)","http://www.unaids.org/en/, U.

In-depth interviews were completed with 16 participants from a variety of units at a large teaching hospital in Uganda. Although participants were knowledgeable about universal precautions, the primary challenge to the practice of universal precautions was the inadequate supply of resources, both material and human. Despite challenges, the nurses displayed an enthusiasm for their work and a dedication to provide the best possible care for patients. The findings highlight the urgent need for governments and institutions, particularly in resource-constrained countries, to develop and implement policies related to universal precaution practice and to provide a consistent supply of protective equipment to ensure that universal precautions are consistently used. © 2014 Association of Nurses in AIDS Care.","AIDS; Focused ethnography; HIV; Nurses; Uganda; Universal precautions",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924566032

The purpose of this study was to assess the factors associated with the use of condoms in a representative sample of PLWHA in outpatient treatment in the city of São Paulo. Six hundred and sixty-seven HIV-positive patients (383 men and 284 women) who were being treated at eight centers participated in this study. Data were collected using a sociodemographic survey, the Beck depression and anxiety inventories, a survey of alcohol and other drugs use, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, a sexual behavior survey, and the Sexual Risk Behavior Assessment Schedule. The majority of study participants were sexually active (almost 62% of the sample had at least one sexual partner in the last three months), and at least one-fourth engaged in unsafe sex (25.3% did not use condoms during at least one instance of anal and/or vaginal intercourse in the past three months). Multivariate logistic regression showed that engaging in unprotected sex was more likely among females (p < .001), persons with an HIV-positive partner (p < .001), and people using cannabis before sex (p = .002). These findings should stimulate health-care workers to create specific groups for women, seroconcordant couples, and cannabis users to discuss condom use, as they seem to be vulnerable groups. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","HIV/AIDS; Outpatient treatment; Sexual partner; Sexual risk behavior; Substance use","Bertolucci, P.H.F., Brucki, S.M.D., Campacci, S.R., Juliano, Y., The mini-mental state examination in an outpatient population: Influence of literacy (1994) Arquivos de Neuro-psiquiatria, 52 (1), pp. 1-7; Bouhnik, A.D., Préau, M., Schiltz, M.A., Lert, F., Obadia, Y., Spire, B., Unprotected sex in regular partnerships among homosexual men living with HIV: A comparison between sero-nonconcordant and seroconcordant couples (ANRS-EN12-VESPA Study) (2007) AIDS, 21, pp. S43-S48; Drug use in Brazil (2009) Brazilian Report on Alcohol and Drugs, pp. 19-56. , Brazil P.

South Africa has the largest antiretroviral therapy programme in the world, with over 2.7 million people on treatment in 2013. Since its belated and controversial beginning, the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission programme has achieved a substantial reduction in vertical transmission. South Africa is justifiably proud of this success. However, the history of Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) and antiretroviral therapy programmes in South Africa has been fraught with delays and political intervention. South Africa could have started both PMTCT and antiretroviral therapy programmes in 2000. Instead, the AIDS denialist views of the government allowed the HIV epidemic to spiral out of control. Roll-out of a national PMTCT programme began in 2002, but only after the government was forced to do so by a Constitutional Court ruling. Now, a decade later, HIV treatment and prevention programmes have been completely transformed. This article will discuss the evolution of the HIV epidemic in South Africa, and give a historical overview of the struggle to establish a national PMTCT, and the impact of delaying PMTCT and treatment programmes on infant and maternal health. © The Author(s) 2015 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav","AIDS; complications; drugs (medication); HIV; infectious diseases; maternal child transmission; maternal mortality; maternal-fetal medicine","National Antenatal Sentinel HIV & Herpes Simplex Type-2 Prevalence Survey in South Africa (2012) Report.

We sought to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying the effect of hormonal contraception on the immune system. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: To delineate the biological mechanisms underlying the effect of hormonal contraceptives on the immune system, we analyzed the functional capacity of circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), the distribution of vaginal immune cell populations, and the systemic and genital levels of immune mediators in women using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), NuvaRing, or combined oral contraceptives (COC). Results: The use of DMPA or NuvaRing was associated with reduced capacity of circulating pDCs to produce interferon (IFN)-α and tumor necrosis (TNF-α) in response to TLR-9 stimulation. Systemic levels of IFN-α and cervicovaginal fluid levels of IFN-α, CXCL10, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor were significantly lower in DMPA users compared to control volunteers not using hormonal contraception. The density of CD207 + Langerhans cells in the vaginal epithelium was reduced in NuvaRing and combined oral contraceptive users but not in DMPA users. Conclusions: The presented evidence suggests that the use of some types of hormonal contraception is associated with reduced functional capacity of circulating pDCs and altered immune environment in the female reproductive tract. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Motherhood may influence women's livelihoods as sex workers and their subsequent HIV risks. We used qualitative research methods (30 in-depth interviews and three focus group discussions) and employed Connell's theory of Gender and Power to explore the intersections between motherhood, sex work, and HIV-related risk. Participants were adult women who self-reported exchanging sex for money within the past month and worked in entertainment venues in southern Tanzania. Participants had two children on average, and two-thirds had children at home. Women situated their socially stigmatised work within their respectable identities as mothers caring for their children. Being mothers affected sex workers' negotiating power in complex manners, which led to both reported increases in HIV-related risk behaviours (accepting more clients, accepting more money for no condom, anal sex), and decreases in risk behaviours (using condoms, demanding condom use, testing for HIV). Sex workers/mothers were aware of risks at work, but with children to support, their choices were constrained. Future policies and programming should consider sex workers' financial and practical needs as mothers, including those related to their children such as school fees and childcare. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","gender; HIV/AIDS; motherhood; power; sex work","Akujobi, R., Motherhood in African Literature and Culture (2011) CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture, 13 (1). , http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/clcweb/vol13/iss1/2; Alexander, P., Sex Work and Health: A Question of Safety in the Workplace (1998) Journal of the American Medical Women's Association, 53 (2), pp. 77-82; Amadiume, I., (1987) Male Daughters, Female Husbands: Gender and Sex in an African Society, , London: Zed Books; Arendell, T., Conceiving and Investigating Motherhood: The Decade's Scholarship (2000) Journal of Marriage and Family, 62 (4), pp. 1192-1207; Aubé-Maurice, J., Clément, M., Bradley, J., Lowndes, C.M., Gurav, K., Alary, M., Gender Relations and Risks of HIV Transmission in South India: The Discourse of Female Sex Workers' Clients (2012) Culture, Health & Sexuality, 14 (6), pp. 629-644; Baral, S., Beyrer, C., Muessig, K., Poteat, T., Wirtz, A.L., Decker, M.R., Sherman, S.G., Kerrigan, D., Burden of HIV among Female Sex Workers in Low-income and Middle-income Countries: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (2012) The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 12 (7), pp. 538-549; Barrington, C., Latkin, C., Sweat, M.D., Moreno, L., Ellen, J., Kerrigan, D., Talking the Talk, Walking the Walk: Social Network Norms, Communication Patterns, and Condom Use among the Male Partners of Female Sex Workers in La Romana, Dominican Republic (2009) Social Science & Medicine, 68 (11), pp. 2037-2044; Basu, A., Dutta, M.J., ‘We are Mothers First’: Localocentric Articulation of Sex Worker Identity as a Key in HIV/AIDS Communication (2011) Women & Health, 51 (2), pp. 106-123; Beckham, S.W., Kennedy, C.E., Brahmbhatt, H., Kerrigan, D., (2013) Strategic Assessment to Define a Comprehensive Response to the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Iringa, Tanzania: Research Brief: Female Sex Workers, , http://www.jhsph.edu/r2p, Baltimore, MD: USAID | Project Search: Research to Prevention; Castañeda, X., Ortíz, V., Allen, B., García, C., Hernández-Avila, M., Sex Masks: The Double Life of Female Commercial Sex Workers in Mexico City (1996) Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry, 20 (2), pp. 229-247; Charmaz, K., (2006) Constructing Grounded Theory: A Practical Guide Through Qualitative Analysis, , London: Sage Publications; Chersich, M.F., Luchters, S., Ntaganira, I., Gerbase, A., Lo, Y.R., Scorgie, F., Steen, R., Priority Interventions to Reduce HIV Transmission in Sex Work Settings in Sub-Saharan Africa and Delivery of These Services (2013) Journal of the International AIDS Society, 16 (1), p. 17980; Choi, S.Y.P., Holroyd, E., The Influence of Power, Poverty and Agency in the Negotiation of Condom Use for Female Sex Workers in Mainland China (2007) Culture, Health & Sexuality, 9 (5), pp. 489-503; Connell, R.W., (1987) Gender and Power: Society, the Person and Sexual Politics, , Redwood City, CA: Stanford University Press; Connell, R., (2002) Gender, , Cambridge: Polity; Delacoste, F., Alexander, P., (1987) Sex Work: Writings by Women in the Sex Industry, , San Francisco, CA: Cleis Press; Fischer, G., Tanzanian Women's Move into Wage Labour: Conceptualizing Deference, Sexuality and Respectability as Criteria for Workplace Suitability (2014) Gender, Work & Organization, 21 (2), pp. 135-148; Friese, S., (2011) Qualitative Data Analysis with Atlas.ti, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; (1981) Tanzania Penal Code Chapter 16 of the Laws (Revised) (Principal Legislation), , http://www.lrct.go.tz; Haram, L., ‘Prostitutes’ or Modern Women?

A 2-week HIV/AIDS prevention education program was arranged for a single group of 50 students from one junior high school and a pretest and posttest were conducted. A total of 45 valid questionnaires were completed. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, the McNemar test, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: Results indicate that the education program improved the knowledge (p < .001) and attitude (p < .05) of participants significantly between pretest and posttest. The posttest score for knowledge (9.47 ± 3.24) was significantly higher than the pretest score (6.11 ± 3.84). The posttest score for positive attitude (3.72 ± 0.36) was also significantly higher than the pretest score (3.43 ± 0.34). Conclusions / Implications for Practice: This AIDS prevention education program significantly improved the related knowledge and attitudes of participants. Schools and health units may reference the results of this study to design materials for prevention of HIV/AIDS, particularly in the context of indigenous adolescents. © 2015, Taiwan Nurses Association.

In addition, the HIV/AIDS context is characterized by significant affective or emotional aspects including stigma, fear, and coping. Thus, studies of information behavior in this context should be expected to take account of emotional variables. In information behavior scholarship, emotional variables have been marginalized in favor of a focus on cognitive aspects, although in recent years greater attention has been paid to the affective realm. This study used quantitative content analysis to explore the degree to which information behavior studies across a range of disciplines actually include affect or emotion in their analyses. Findings suggest that most studies pay little or no attention to these variables, and that attention has not changed over the past 20. years. Those studies that do account for emotion, however, provide excellent examples of information behavior research that can lead the way for future work. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Affect; Content analysis; Emotion; HIV/AIDS; Information behavior","Abba, S., Leleu-Merviel, S., Hachimi, E.M.A., Identification of the information needs of African populations about the AIDS problem (2006) Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science, 30, pp. 91-91; Adetoro, N., Oyefuga, A.B., Simisaye, A.O., Persons with HIV in Ijebu-Ode, Nigeria: Self-concept and information needs (2010) Chinese Librarianship, 29, p. 1; Agboola, I.O., Undergraduate student awareness of HIV/AIDS and information needs: A study of University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria (2012) PNLA Quarterly, 76, pp. 126-135; Aharony, N., Library and information science research areas: A content analysis of articles from the top 10 journals 2007-8 (2012) Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, 44, pp. 27-35; Ajayi, N.A., Omotayo, B.O., Challenges of HIV/AIDS to undergraduate students: The librarian's reaction (2010) International Journal of Library and Information Science, 2 (5), pp. 88-94; Albright, K., HIV/AIDS information seeking and healthcare communications in Sub-Saharan Africa (2007) IFLA Conference Proceedings, pp. 1-13. , http://archive.ifla.org/IV/ifla73/papers/107-Albright-en.pdf; Albright, K., Multidisciplinarity in information behavior: Expanding boundaries or fragmentation of the field?
