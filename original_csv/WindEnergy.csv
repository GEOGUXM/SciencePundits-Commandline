It is important that operators understand how these stochastic characteristics of uncertainties affect the stable operation of power system. In this paper, the combinations of uncertainties that are power fluctuation due to forecasting deviation of wind speed, solar radiation and load. Framework is established including joint probabilistic models of several uncertainties and the risk models of load shed under two different scenarios. An economic dispatch model considering unit commitment is proposed to minimize the generation cost and operational cost and starting-up cost of conventional power units, combined heat and power (CHP) units and heat-only units. However, high/low risk of load shed does not represent large/small of load loss in fact, thus the load loss is defined as multiplying of load shed risk and load loss amount, which is described by methodology of α-superquantile. Effectiveness of proposed model is examined by case studies and the numerical results are presented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Combined heat and power (CHP); Economic dispatch; Load loss; Spinning reserve; Unit commitment; α-superquantile","Hargreaves, J.J., Hobbs, B.F., Commitment and dispatch with uncertain wind generation by dynamic programming (2012) Sust Energy, IEEE Trans, 3 (4), pp. 725-730; Karki, R., Thapa, S., Billinton, R., A simplified risk-based method for short-term wind power commitment (2012) Sust Energy, IEEE Trans, 3 (3), pp. 498-503; Meghdadi, A.H., Akbarzadeh-T, M.-R., Probabilistic fuzzy logic and probabilistic fuzzy systems (2001) Proc.

The Gansu provincial wind energy resources have around 237-GW wind power potential in China. In this paper, a study on key technologies of Hexi 750-kV power transmission line protections has been carried out. The project includes some characteristics, such as large-scale wind power, long-distance EHV lines, and so on. We used 49.5-MW doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbines in this project and different situations when a fault occurs in the presence of DFIG are studied and investigated. By the aid of stator-flux-oriented vector strategy, the system is modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC software on the basis of the real information from the wind farm site. The fault analysis is studied while the fault location is changed and the crowbar protection is ON/OFF. The data and information have been obtained by field experience of the wind farm in Gansu province. Also, the matrix pencil algorithm has been applied as a novel method in this project. This analysis can ease the protection issues and push the schedule to the next steps. With these results, we are able to adapt our system with smart grids and provide some novel methods to stabilize and control the wind farm. © 2003-2010 IEEE.","Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG); fault analysis; PSCAD; stator-flux-oriented vector; wind farm","Babu, B.C., Mohanty, K.B., Doubly-fed induction generator for variable speed wind energy conversion systems-modeling & simulation (2010) Int.

Finding a suitable location requires a detailed and often costly analysis of local wind conditions. Plain average wind speed maps cannot provide a precise forecast of wind power because of the non-linear relationship between wind speed and production. We suggest a new approach to assess the local wind energy potential. First, meteorological reanalysis data are applied to obtain long-term low-scale wind speed data at specific turbine locations and hub heights. Second, the relation between wind data and energy production is determined via a five parameter logistic function using actual high-frequency energy production data. The resulting wind energy index allows for a turbine-specific estimation of the expected wind power at an unobserved location. A map of the wind power potential for Germany exemplifies our approach. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy production; MERRA; Onshore wind; Renewable energy; Wind power","Archer, C.L., Jacobson, M.Z., Spatial and temporal distributions of US winds and wind power at 80 m derived from measurements (2003) JGeophys Res Atmos, 108, pp. 1-20; Archer, C.L., Jacobson, M.Z., Evaluation of global wind power (2005) JGeophys Res Atmos, 110, pp. 1-20; Arlot, S., Celisse, A., Asurvey of cross-validation procedures for model selection (2010) Stat Surv, 4, pp. 40-79; (2011) Einführung in den BDB-Index der Betreiber Datenbasis (BDB), , http://www.btrdb.de/PDF/IndexV2011Einfuehrung.pdf; Brower, M.C., Barton, M.S., Lledó, L., Dubois, J., (2013) Astudy of wind speed variability using global reanalysis data, , Technical report, AWS True Power; Brown, B.G., Katz, R.W., Murphy, A.H., Time series models to simulate and forecast wind speed and wind power (1984) JClim Appl Meteorol, 23 (8), pp. 1184-1195; (2013) Ergebnisbericht der Arbeitsgruppe Langzeitbezug des BWE-Windgutachterbeirates; Caporin, M., Preś, J., Modelling and forecasting wind speed intensity for weather risk management (2012) Comput Stat Data Analysis, 56 (11), pp. 3459-3476; Carta, J.A., Velázquez, S., Cabrera, P., Areview of measure-correlate-predict (MCP) methods used to estimate long-term wind characteristics at a target site (2013) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 27 (0), pp. 362-400; Carvalho, D., Rocha, A., Gómez-Gesteira, M., Santos, C.S., WRF wind simulation and wind energy production estimates forced by different reanalyses: comparison with observed data for Portugal (2014) Appl Energy, 117 (0), pp. 116-126; Chang, T.-J., Wu, Y.-T., Hsu, H.-Y., Chu, C.-R., Liao, C.-M., Assessment of wind characteristics and wind turbine characteristics in Taiwan (2003) Renew Energy, 28 (6), pp. 851-871; (2009) Windgeschwindigkeiten in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, , http://www.dwd.de/windkarten; Firtin, E., Güler, Ö., Akdağ, S.A., Investigation of wind shear coefficients and their effect on electrical energy generation (2011) Appl Energy, 88 (11), pp. 4097-4105; Gastón, M., Pascal, E., Frías, L., Martí, I., Irigoyen, U., Cantero, E., Wind resources map of Spain at mesoscale.

In order to provide students with deeper understanding of wind energy and energy extraction, a maximum power point tracking algorithm is developed and integrated into the control system. The multivariable control system is implemented in a small wind turbine laboratory system. A power electronic interface is based on two DC-DC converters: a buck converter for control of the speed and a boost converter controlling the load voltage.

Concept study of wind power utilizing direct thermal energy conversion and thermal energy storage named Wind powered Thermal Energy System (WTES) is conducted. The thermal energy is generated from the rotating energy directly at the top of the tower by the heat generator, which is a kind of simple and light electric brake. The rest of the system is the same as the tower type concentrated solar power (CSP). The cost estimation suggests that the energy cost of WTES is less than that of the conventional wind power, which must be supported by the backup thermal plants and grid enhancement. The light heat generator reduces some issues of wind power such as noise and vibration. © 2015 The Authors.","Concentrated solar power; Heat generator; Induction generator; Thermal energy storage; Wind power","Arita, M., Yokoyama, A., Tada, Y., Evaluation of battery system for frequency control in interconnected power system with a large penetration of wind power generation (2006) Int Conf On Power System Tech, , [Chong qing, Chi]; Rinaldi, F., Binotti, M., Giostri, A., Manzolini, G., Comparison of linear and point focus collectors in solar power plants (2014) Energy Procedia, 49, pp. 1492-1500; (2015), http://www.energystorageexchange.org/projects, [Retrieved 20/01/2015]Thess André Thermodynamic efficiency of pumped heat electricity storage (2013) Phys Rev Lett, 111, p. 110602; European Patent EP1 577 548 A1 Apparatus and method for storing thermal energy and generating electricity(2012), On-demand generation Electr stored wind energy Published Dec. 27Barnhart, C., Dale, M., Brandt, A., Benson, S., The energetic implications of curtailing versus storing solar- and wind-generated electricity (2013) Energy Environ Sci, pp. 2804-2810; Sioshansi, R., Denholm, P., Benefits of co-locating concentrating solar power and wind (2013) IEEE Trans Sustain Energy, 4 (4), pp. 877-885; Dunn, R., Hears, P., Weight, M., Molten-salt power towers: newly commercial concentrating solar storage (2012) Proc IEEE, 100 (2), pp. 504-515; Lorubio, G., (2011) Flexible generation: backing up renewable, p. 26. , Union of the Electricity Industry - EURELECTRIC, DépÔt légal: D/2011/12.105/47; Statistical Series of RED Electrica (2014), http://www.ree.es/en/publications/indicators-and-statistical-data/statistical-series, (Retrieved 22/12/2014)(2009) Wind energy-the case of Denmark, p. 25. , Center for Polotiske Studier; Dena Dena grid study II-integration of renewable energy sources (2011) German power supply system from 2015-2020 with an outlook to 2025, , German Energy Agency; Fraunhofer IWES (2012) Wind energy report Germany, p. 17; (2010) Powering Europe: wind energy and the electricity grid; Göransson, L., Johnsson, F., Large scale integration of wind power inthermal power systems (2010) Wind power, pp. 479-498; Hoogwijk, M., Vuuren, D., Vries, B., Turkenburg, W., Exploring the impact on cost and electricity production of high penetration levels of intermittent electricity in OECD Europe and the USA, results for wind energy (2006) Energy; (2008) 20% wind energy by 2030, p. 80. , DOE/GO-102008-2567, p.162; (2012) Ten-year network development plan 2010-2020, p. 146; (2013) Grid energy storage; Kolb, G., (2011) An evaluation of possible next-generation high-temperature molten-salt power towers, p. 20. , SANDIA REPORT SAND2011-9320; Krohn, S., Morthorst, P., Awerbuch, S., (2009) The economics of wind energy, p. 37. , A report by the European Wind Energy Association; (2003) Assessment of parabolic trough and power tower solar technology cost and performance forecasts, , Sargent & Lundy LLC Consulting Group, NREL/SR-550-34440, 4-5; China wind power industry drowned in recession (2015), http://time-az.com/main/detail/34635, (Japanese) (Retrieved 26/01/2015)Mount, T., Lamadrid, A., Maneevitjit, S., Thomas, B., Zimmerman, R., The hidden system cost of wind generation in a deregulated electricity market (2010) Proceedings of the 43rd Hawaii international conference on system sciences (HICSS-43), , IEEE Computer Society; Taylor, G., Tanton, T., (2012) The hidden costs of wind electricity, , American Tradition Institute; Kolb, G., Ho, C., Mancini, T., Gary, J., (2011) Power tower technology roadmap and cost reduction plan, p. 17. , SANDIA REPORT SAND2011-2419; Noguchi, Y., Miyahara, M., Imanishi, K., Saitoh, A., Kishine, N., Creep-fatigue prediction for permanent magnet type eddy current retarder (2002) Fatigue, 5 (5), pp. 3101-3108; Feldle, G., Canned motor pumps for high temperature applications in solar thermal power stations Technical report, HERMETIC-Pumpen GmbH GundelfingenRunde, M., Magnusson, N., Fülbier, C., Bührer, C., Commercial induction heaters with high temperature superconductor coils (2011) IEEE Trans Appl Supercond, 21, pp. 1379-1383; Stefano, G., Buck, R., Eguiguren, S., Analysis of solar-thermal power plants with thermal energy storage and solar-hybrid operation strategy (2011) Trans ASME N Journal Sol Energy Eng, 133 (3), p. 031007; Steinfeld, A., Palumbo, R., (2001) Solar thermochemical process technology, 15, pp. 237-256. , Academic Press; (2013) Concentrating solar power program review 2013, , R.

Africa is a privileged continent in terms of wind resource regime. However, very little of this has been utilized. It is thus essential to identify and define the amount of wind energy that could be technically exploited on the continent. The utilization of wind energy is associated with a myriad of localization criteria and thus it should be systematically addressed by spatial assessments to guarantee its harmonization with socio-economic systems, infrastructure and ecosystems. This study focuses on onshore wind power on the African continent and strives to provide estimates of theoretical, geographical and technical potential based on state of the art wind power technology. Maps of wind power potential at 80m, which is the hub height of a modern wind turbine will be derived via statistical distribution of wind speed data and implementation of wind power curves. Screening criteria regarding the localization of wind farms and related to socio-economic and geographic constraints are outlined and implemented through a thorough GIS analysis. The results of this work are presented and compared with similar approaches and significant conclusions are drawn. Based on the analysis there are some countries that signify high yearly wind energy yield, such as South Africa, Sudan, Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Nigeria, Mauritania, Tunisia and Morocco, whilst Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Central African Republic, Burundi, Liberia, Benin and Togo indicate the least wind power potential. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Africa;

To document and understand this objection, we take a cognitive mapping approach, commenting on its value as a method and focussing particularly on the issue of community compensation. Cognitive mapping structures the causal logic of individuals' thinking, revealing this and facilitating group discussion. Here we compare cognitive maps that reflect different positions on the controversy. Both monetary and in-kind compensation are dismissed by local campaigners and local stakeholder representatives alike. In-kind compensation is regarded as inadequate firstly because it cannot provide the scale of the public goods perceived as necessary by the host community. Secondly, the developer is in any case considered inappropriate as provider of public goods, which the community think should be delivered by local and regional governments. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cognitive map; Community compensation; Public objection; Wind power","(2015) Wind in power: 2014 European statistics [online], , http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/files/library/publications/statistics/EWEA-Annual-Statistics-2014.pdf, The European Association of Wind Energy, Available from:, [accessed 20.04.15]; (2013) La eólica en España.

Load and production data from the German power system is used to quantify the flexibility need in terms of power and energy storage requirement due to higher shares of renewable energy (20-80%). It is found that with an 80% variable renewable energy share in the German system, the average power need from flexible sources decreases by 31 GW (59%) while the peak power need only decreases by 3 GW (4%). In terms of energy, the storage need over a two week horizon increases by 2.6 TWh, which is 14% of the average load per day. If the European plans for 100 GW wind power in the North Sea region are realised, this would mean an increase of the energy storage need in the region with 2.2 TWh over a two week horizon. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Balancing; Dispatching; Energy storage; Solar power; Wind power","Castronuovo, E.D., Lopes, J.A.P., Optimal operation and hydro storage sizing of a wind-hydro power plant (2004) Int J Electr Power Energy Syst, 26 (10), pp. 771-778; Black, M., Strbac, G., Value of bulk energy storage for managing wind power fluctuations (2007) IEEE Trans Energy Convers, 22 (1), pp. 197-205; Hartmann, B., Dan, A., Cooperation of a grid-connected wind farm and an energy storage unit; demonstration of a simulation tool (2012) IEEE Trans Sustain Energy, 3 (1), pp. 49-56; Makarov, Y., Du, P., Kintner-Meyer, M., Jin, C., Illian, H., Sizing energy storage to accommodate high penetration of variable energy resources (2012) IEEE Trans Sustain Energy, 3 (1), pp. 34-40; Kreikebaum, F., Moghe, R., Prasai, A., Divan, D., Evaluating the application of energy storage and day-ahead solar forecasting to firm the output of a photovoltaic plant (2011) Energy conversion congress and exposition (ECCE), 2011, pp. 3556-3561. , IEEE; Holttinen, H., Impact of hourly wind power variations on the system operation in the nordic countries (2005) Wind Energy, 8 (2), pp. 197-218; Anagnostopoulos, J.S., Papantonis, D.E., Pumping station design for a pumped-storage wind-hydro power plant (2007) Energy Convers Manag, 48 (11), pp. 3009-3017. , 19th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems; Pinson, P., Papaefthymiou, G., Klockl, B., Verboomen, J., Dynamic sizing of energy storage for hedging wind power forecast uncertainty (2009) Power energy society general meeting, 2009.

The transmission consists of a single one-stage planetary gear train (PGT) with three rotating shafts and a simple control system consisting of a few sensors and a control motor controlled by a microprocessor. One of the PGT shafts is the input, another is the output, and the third is coupled to the control motor as second input. The optimal tip-speed ratio is kept constant at low wind speeds by controlling the speed of the control motor, maximising the capture of energy from the wind. The wind-rotor speed continues to vary above the rated wind speed zone, but the rotor shaft power is kept constant by using the same control system. In this way, a constant electrical power output is achieved without altering the blade pitch, i.e., with the rotor in a fixed geometry. A frame design procedure for the transmission is proposed, efficiency expressions are derived, an example transmission operation is presented and efficiency comparisons to a mainstream variable speed wind turbine are carried out. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Control system; Efficiency; Planetary gear train; Power circulation","Burton, T., Sharpe, D., Jenkins, N., Bossanyi, E., (2011) Wind energy handbook, , John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, UK; Carlin, P.W., Laxson, A.S., Muljadi, E.B., The history and state of the art of variable-speed wind turbine technology (2003) Wind Energy, 6, pp. 129-169; Jamieson, P., (2011) Innovation in wind turbine design, , John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, UK; Idan, M., Lior, D., Continuously variable speed wind turbine: transmission concept and robust control (2000) Wind Eng, 24, pp. 151-167; Hicks, R.J., Cunliffe, F., Optimised gearbox for modern wind turbines (2004) Proc.

As for any energy equipment, reliability is the fundamental attribute that needs to be guaranteed. A number of studies have been carried out for wind turbine reliability assessment. Most of them model the wind turbine system as a whole, without investigating its interior structure and failure logic. In this paper, a modeling and simulation framework is proposed for the reliability assessment of generic geared wind turbine systems. It is based on a Goal Tree, Success Tree and Master Logic Diagram for modeling the relationships among components and functions in a wind turbine system, and the impact of factors and mechanisms influencing the failure of the components. The modeling framework is customized to represent the strength of the relationships and the uncertainty of the impact of failures of these components on other components and functions. The model is eventually integrated in a Monte Carlo simulation framework for the computation of the wind turbine system reliability. Finally, model validation is performed by comparing the simulation results with those obtained by a Bayesian network model developed for this purpose. •We propose a reliability model and simulation framework for wind turbine system.•We consider the logic relationships among different components in the system.•The GTST-MLD approach is used to develop the model for reliability evaluation.•A simulation framework is developed for the quantification of the model.•The proposed framework is validated by comparing with Bayesian network modeling. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Goal tree;

Quantification of uncertainties associated with accurate wind speed forecasts is essential for regulating wind power generation and integration. However, it remains difficult work primarily due to the stochastic and nonlinear characteristics of wind speed series. Traditional models for wind speed forecasting mostly focus on generating certain predictive values, which cannot properly handle uncertainties. For quantifying potential uncertainties, a hybrid model constructed by the Cuckoo Search Optimization (CSO)-based Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is proposed to establish wind speed interval forecasts (IFs) by estimating the lower and upper bounds. The quality of IFs is assessed quantitatively using IFs coverage probability (IFCP) and IFs normalized average width (IFNAW). Moreover, to assess the overall quality of IFs comprehensively, a tradeoff between informativeness (IFNAW) and validity (IFCP) of IFs is examined by coverage width-based criteria (CWC). As an applicative study, wind speeds from the Xinjiang Region in China are used to validate the proposed hybrid model. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can construct higher quality IFs for short-term wind speed forecasts. © 2014 The Authors.

Amongst the renewable sources, solar and wind have gained acceptance and are being increasingly used in distributed generation. The main problem with these sources is the dependence of their power output on natural environmental parameters at a given point of time. This paper proposes time series models for short-term prediction of solar irradiance from which solar power can be predicted. The predictions are done for 1 day ahead using different time-series models. For each model, these predicted values are compared with the actual values for the next day and graphs are plotted. Basic time-series models such as moving average and exponential smoothing were tested. The decomposition model is proposed, where the measured data is decomposed into seasonal and trend patterns and each of them predicted separately. The model was developed for different durations of data, to identify the best possible set of data. It is observed from the results that the prediction with decomposition model for 2 months data gave the best result with around 9.28% error. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Forecast; Prediction; Solar irradiance; Time series","Makridakis, S., Wheelwright, S.C., Hyndman, R.J., (2013) Forecasting methods and applications, , Wiley Student Edition; Lim, P.Y., (2011) Power management strategies for off-grid hybrid power systems, , [Ph.D thesis], School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University; Bacher, P., (2012) Models for efficient integration of solar energy, , [Ph.D thesis], Technical University of Denmark; Madsen, H., Nielsen, H.A., Jonsson, T., Pinson, P., Bacher, P., (2011) Forecasting of wind and solar power production, , [Research thesis], Technical University of Denmark; Prema, V., Uma Rao, K., Predictive models for power management of a hybrid microgrid-a review 2nd International Conference on Advances in Energy Conversion Technologies (ICAECT 2014); Bacher, P., (2008) Short-term solar power forecasting, , [Research thesis], Technical University of Denmark; Mahamad, N., Kamal, M., Mohammed Amin, B., Power prediction analysis using artificial neural network in MS Excel (2013) 7th International Conference on Latest Trends in Renewable Energy and Environmental Informatics, Malaysia, pp. 54-58; Yona, A., Senjyu, T., Funabashi, T., Kim, C.-H., Determination method of insolation prediction with fuzzy and applying neural network for long-term ahead PV power output correction (2013) IEEE Trans Sustain Energy, 4 (2), pp. 527-533; Kaplanis, S., Kaplani, E., Amodel to predict expected mean and stochastic hourly global solar radiation I(h;nj) values (2007) Int J Renew Energy, 32, pp. 1414-1425. , Elsevier; Sharma, N., Sharma, P., Irwin, D., Shenoy, P., Predicting solar generation from weather forecasts using machine learning (2011) IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (Smart Grid Comm), Brussels, Belgium, pp. 376-382; Espinar, B., Aznarte, J.L., Girard, R., Moussa, A.M., Kariniotakis, G., Photovoltaic Forecasting: a state of the art (2010) 5th European PV-Hybrid and Mini-Grid Conference-Tarragona, Spain, pp. 65-70; Camacho, E.F., Samad, T., Garcia-Sanz, M., Hiskens, I., Control for renewable energy and smart grids (2011) Int J Impact Control Technol, 6, pp. 19-25; Dong, Z., Yang, D., Walsh, W.M., Reindl, T., Abrle, A., Short-term solar irradiance forecasting using exponential smoothing state space model (2013) Int J Energy, 55, pp. 1104-1113; Kleissl, J., (2013) Solar energy forecasting and resource assessment, , Academic Press; Wu, J., Chan, K., The prediction of monthly average solar radiation with TDNN and ARIMA (2011) Int J Sol Energy, 85 (5), pp. 808-817; Mori, H., Takahashi, A., Adata mining method for selecting input variables for forecasting model of global solar radiation (2012) IEEE PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition (T&D), Orlando, Florida - USA, pp. 1-6; Brockwell, P.J., Davis, R.A., (2013) Time series: theory and methods, , Springer; Paul, T., Cookbook, R., OReilly; Hamilton, J.D., (1994) Time series analysis, , Princeton University Press; Box, G.E.P., Hunter, J.S., Hunter, W.G., (2005) Statistics for Experimenters: design, discovery, and innovation, , John Wiley and sons Publications, 13 978-047 J -71813; (2012) 'Statement of objects and reasons', (terms and conditions for tariff determination from renewable energy sources) regulations, , Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), New Delhi; Sharma, N., Gummeson, J., Irwin, D., Shenoy, P., Cloudy computing: leveraging weather forecasts in energy harvesting sensor systems (2012) JEnergies, 5, pp. 1355-1370",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928548364

This methodology consists of a sea state selection technique (MaxDiss), then this selected sea states are introduced into a numerical model in order to calculate the power performance. Finally this data are interpolated with a non linear technique (Radial Basis functions) in order to obtain the long term performance of a WEC on a long met-ocean data series with low computational requirements. In this paper, three types of converter, a one body heaving converter (follower), a two-body resonant converter as well as a deep water flap are investigated. Also four different locations with different met-ocean conditions in terms of the scatter plots and the sea conditions (swell-wind sea) distribution were selected (North of Spain, West of Denmark, Chile and West of Ireland). The methodology worked perfectly for all the selected alternatives, although it was demonstrated to work better for non-resonant converters that are not band limited in their frequency response. Also, the classical method of power production assessment based on the power matrix was reviewed, analysing the analytical spectrum assumption. The influence of more than one peak spectrum on the power production was found to be large on a sea state by sea state basis (±200%) but also on the Annual Energy Production (±40%). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Long-term; Met-ocean; Power matrix; Sea state; Spectrum; Wave energy converter","Andres, A.D., Guanche, R., del Jesus, F., Vidal, C., Losada, I.J., Time domain model of a teo body heave converter: model and applications (2013) Ocean Eng, 72, pp. 116-123; Guanche, R., de Andres, A., Simal, P.D., Vidal, C., Losada, I.J., Uncertainty analysis of wave energy farms financial indicators (2014) Renew Energy, 68, pp. 570-580; Snarey, M., Terrett, N.K., Willett, P., Wilton, D.J., Comparison of algorithms for dissimilarity-based compound selection (1997) JMol Graph Model, 15, pp. 372-385; Franke, R., Scattered data interpolation: tests of some method (1982) Math Comput, 38, pp. 181-200; Camus, P., Mendez, F., Medina, R., Cofiño, A., Analysis of clustering and selection algorithms for the study of multivariate wave climate (2011) Coast Eng, 58, pp. 453-462; Babarit, A., Hals, J., Muliawan, M.J., Kurniawan, A., Moan, T., Krokstad, J., Numerical benchmarking study of a selection of wave energy converters (2011) Renew Energy, 41; Kerbiriou, M., Prevosto, M., Maisondieu, C., Babarit, A., Clement, A., Influence of an improved sea-state description on a wave energy converter production (2007) Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Artic Engineering, , [San Diego, California, USA]; Kerbiriou, M., Prevosto, M., Maisondieu, C., Clement, A., Babarit, A., Influence of sea-states description on wave energy production (2007) Proceedings of the European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference, , [Porto]; Saulnier, J., Clement, A., Falcao, A., Pontes, T., Prevosto, M., Ricci, P., Wave groupiness and spectral bandwidth as relevant parameters for the performance assessment of wave energy converters (2011) Ocean Eng, 38 (1); Saulnier, J., Prevosto, M., Maisondieu, C., Refinements of sea state statistics for marine renewables: a case study from simultaneous buoy measurements in Portugal (2011) Renew Energy, 36 (11); Falnes, J., (2002) Ocean waves and oscillating systems, , Cambridge University Press; (2000) Goda Random seas and design of maritime structures, 133, p. 367. , equation 10; http://www.seatricity.net/, Seactricity.

To disentangle the pure effect of the GP from other effects due to non-adiabatic couplings between the two coupled potential energy surfaces, we perform two different calculations, one adopting the diabatic representation which implicitly includes the GP, and another one using the adiabatic picture where GP effects are excluded. To interpret the impact of the GP on nuclear dynamics, we use a recent topological approach (Althorpe et al., 2008 [45]) to completely unwind the nuclear wavefunction from around the CI. This unwinding allows us to extract from the nuclear wavepacket two contributions of reaction paths that wind in different senses around the CI. The solely effect of the GP is to change the sign of the relative phase between their corresponding wavefunctions, and hence to convert any constructive (destructive) interference of the two components, in the asymptotic dissociative limit, into a destructive (constructive) one. This results in a change of the product-state vibrational distribution from only-even (-odd) quanta progression to only-odd (-even) quanta progression. Although our calculations are based on a reduced-dimensionality model Hamiltonian, our observations and conclusions should apply to realistic polyatomic molecules, and could be useful to interpret product-state vibrational distributions of photodissociation experiments. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The impact of wind power volatility on the energy and spinning reserve market is taken into account. The paper proposes two different market models for the energy and spinning reserve market clearing. One model includes reserve offers from the conventional thermal generators, and another includes reserve offers from both conventional thermal generators and demands. Here, an optimum scheduling strategy is proposed which provides a best-fit day-ahead schedule, which minimizes the both day-ahead and real time adjustment costs, under all possible scenarios in real time.

The paper uses the revised Environmental Statement of the Grove Farm Wind Energy Project, which was rejected during the planning decision consent stage initially and upheld on appeal. The paper evaluates quantitatively the potential impact of an onshore wind farm at the construction and operation stages. Based on the RIAM evaluation conducted, the paper then goes on to apply a mathematical model to the results to determine the indicated potential level and nature of sustainability of the proposed wind farm. The results indicate that the Grove Farm project was deemed, as a whole, detrimental to the environment-human system, particularly in respect to impacts to visual amenity and cultural heritage. The application of the model to the RIAM indicated that in both the construction and operation stages, the project was considered as unsustainable. The results obtained raised legitimate questions as to the benefits of such projects as a major contributor to the UK's renewable and sustainable energy mix. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Environmental impact; Mathematical model; Rapid Impact Assessment Matrix; Sustainability; United Kingdom; Wind farm","Phillips, J., Evaluating the level and nature of sustainable development for a geothermal power plant (2010) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 14, pp. 2414-2425; Phillips, J., Determining the sustainability of large-scale photovoltaic solar power plants (2013) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 27, pp. 435-444; University of Nottingham, (2012) The Grove Farm Wind Turbine Project, , http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/renewableenergyproject/documents/publicmeetingsapril2011.pdf, accessed 03.02.14; AECOM, (2011) Grove Farm Wind Energy Project environmental statement, volume 1 - main text, , http://planning.broxtowe.gov.uk/%28S%28mud20p3eu4gx30npy5e3sx55%29%29/ApplicationHistorySummary.aspx?RefVal=11/00484, accessed 04.02.14; AECOM, (2012) Grove farm wind energy project revised environmental statement, volume 1 - main text, , http://planning.broxtowe.gov.uk/%28S%28mud20p3eu4gx30npy5e3sx55%29%29/ApplicationHistorySummary.aspx?RefVal=11/00484, accessed 04.02.14; Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment (IEMA), Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), (2008), http://www.iema.net/download/readingroom/ebrief/Environmental%20Impact%20Assessment/Environmental%20Impact%20Assessment%20ebrief.doc, accessed 09.04.08Pastakia, C.M.R., (1998) The Rapid Impact Assessment Matrix (RIAM) - a new tool for environmental impact assessment, , http://www.pastakia.com/riam/publication.html, accessed 03.06.06; Pastakia, C.M.R., Jensen, A., The rapid impact assessment matrix (RIAM) for EIA (1998) Environ Impact Assess Rev, 18, pp. 461-482; Phillips, J., (2009) The development and application of a geocybernetic model of sustainability (PhD thesis), , Department of Geography (Streatham Campus) and Camborne School of Mines (Cornwall Campus), University of Exeter United Kingdom; Phillips, J., The advancement of a mathematical model of sustainable development (2010) Sustain Sci, 5, pp. 127-142; (2008) Climate Change Act 2008, , Great Britain.

The flow field in the wake behind the first row turbines is characterized by a significant deficit in wind velocity and increased levels of turbulence intensity. Consequently, the downstream turbines in a wind farm cannot extract as much power from the wind as the first row turbines. Therefore modeling wake effect is necessary because it has a great influence on the actual energy output of a wind farm.

Among renewable energy sources, Iran has a high solar energy potential. The widespread deployment of solar energy is promising due to recent advancements in solar energy technologies. Therefore, many investors inside and outside the country are interested to invest in solar energy development. Iran's total area is around 1600,000 km2 or 1.6×1012 m2 with about 300 clear sunny days in a year and an average 2200 kW-h solar radiation per square meter. Considering only 1% of the total area with 10% system efficiency for solar energy harness, about 9 million MW h of energy can be obtained in a day. The government's goal on 2012 was to install 53,000 MW capacity plants for electricity generation. To reach this goal, it was assumed that the new gas-fired plants along with the hydroelectric and nuclear power generating plants could be financed by independent power producers including those of foreign investment. Based on the fifth 5 year Socio-economic and Cultural Development Plan, the private sector was expected to have a share of at least 270 MW in renewable energy development. The existing small capacity solar energy plants are in Shiraz, Semnan, Taleghan, Yazd, Tehran and Khorasan. Based on the specified available solar trough technology, solar area, average solar hours and average solar direct irradiation, the technical potential of solar electricity was estimated to be 14.7 TWe. Under the current energy policies, the combined solar, wind and geothermal power plants are economically viable. These huge RES's potential can be realized assuming the availability of technology, investment capital, human expertise and the other resources along with a long-term driven renewable energy policy. Due to high growth rate of electricity demand in Iran, the nominal installed capacity has increased by 8.9% per annum during 2001-2007. In the reference scenario, the share of RES in total installed electricity capacity is expected to be about 2% in 2030. It is expected that the cumulative RES installed capacity will reach 2.8 GW in 2030. This requires more than 2800 million US dollar investment during 2010-2030. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity; Iran renewable energies; Solar energy resources; Sustainable development","Hosenuzzaman, M., Rahim, N.A., Selvaraj, J., Hasanuzzaman, M., Malek, A.B.M.A., Nahar, A., Global prospects, progress, policies, and environmental impact of solar photovoltaic power generation (2015) Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev, 41, pp. 284-297; Solangi, K.H., Islam, M.R., Saidur, R., Rahim, N.A., Fayaz, H., A review on global solar energy policy (2011) Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev, 15, pp. 2149-2163; IEA, (2004) International Energy Agency (IEA).

In addition to summer cooling, plants can insulate buildings against heat loss in winter. Research was conducted over two winters using replicated small-scale physical models to simulate heat loss from a built structure and to investigate the insulation properties of plants during cold weather. Brick cuboids were constructed around a water tank maintained at 16°C and energy use monitored. Covering cuboids with ivy (Hedera helix) reduced mean energy consumption by 21% compared to bare cuboids during the first winter (means of 4.3 and 5.4kWh per week, respectively). During the second winter, when foliage was more extensive a 37% mean saving was achieved (3.7 compared to 5.9kWh per week). The presence of Hedera enhanced brick temperatures significantly compared to bare walls. Temperature differences were affected by weather parameters, aspect, diurnal time and canopy density. Largest savings in energy due to vegetation were associated with more extreme weather, such as cold temperatures, strong wind or rain. Under such scenarios green façades could increase energy efficiency by 40-50% and enhance wall surface temperatures by 3°C. These empirical studies with replicated treatments augment previous research based on urban modelling and data from non-replicated individual buildings in situ. They indicate that planting design requires more attention to ensure the heat saving aspects associated with green façades and shelter belts are optimised. These aspects are discussed within the context of wider urban ecosystem services provided by vegetation, and implications for climate change mitigation. © 2015 The Authors.","Energy efficiency; Green facade; Green wall; Retrofitting buildings; Thermal performance; Winter energy saving","Clark, J.A., Johnstone, C.M., Kelly, N.J., Strachan, P.A., Tuohy, P., The role of built environment energy efficiency in a sustainable UK energy economy (2008) Energy Policy, 36, pp. 4605-4609; Pérez-Lombard, L., Ortiz, J., Pout, P., Areview on buildings energy consumption information (2008) Energy Build, 40, pp. 394-398; Baggott, S.L., Cardenas, L., Garnett, E., Jackson, J., Mobbs, D.C., Murrells, T., (2007) UK greenhouse gas inventory: 1990-2005, , UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, London; Pauleit, S., Ennos, R., Golding, Y., Modeling the environmental impacts of urban land use and land cover change - a study in Merseyside, UK (2005) Landsc Urban Plan, 71, pp. 295-310; Gill, S.E., Handley, J.F., Ennos, A.R., Pauleit, S., Adapting cities for climate change: the role of the green infrastructure (2007) Built Environ, 33, pp. 115-133; Cameron, R.W.F., Taylor, J.E., Emmett, M.R., What's 'cool' in the world of green façades?

Nevertheless, the exploitation of small turbines usually faces with several shortcomings and the actual return is often lower than expected, mainly because the power curve given by the manufacturer usually does not reproduce the actual behaviour of the turbines during the operating conditions.Using high-resolution wind speed and energy production measurements, this paper presents an in situ experimental analysis of two small size wind turbines with the same rated power, placed in the same urban environment and realized with vertical and horizontal axis, respectively. Wind conditions are particularly interesting as they are characterized by two distinct regimes, corresponding to low (wind blowing from the sea) and high turbulence (wind blowing from the land).The detected power production is discussed, showing the mutual strengths and weaknesses of the two technologies, focusing on the role of the technical features and control apparatus on the one hand and of the incoming wind conditions and turbulence on the other. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Horizontal axis wind turbine; Power curve; Small size wind turbines; Turbulence effects; Vertical axis wind turbine","Global wind report - annual market update 2013.

Due to integration of large-scale wind power in conventional grids, synchronous generators are being economically replaced. Modern wind farms are based on power electronics interface; and unlike synchronous generators, they do not have inherent frequency support capability. So, in a combined synchronous and non-synchronous machine based power system, it has always been a concern for a network operator to maintain system frequency within acceptable limits following a major disturbance. From power system security point of view, wind penetration can be limited by frequency response criteria. Up to now, several methodologies have been proposed to estimate maximum threshold of wind integration. However, none of them recommends how a system operator could be immediately informed about a secured wind penetration limit, as soon as generation profile is known. This paper proposes a new estimation tool of maximum wind penetration level from the frequency response adequacy point of view. Available system information viz. inertia and headroom are used as input parameters in the developed tool. Output of this tool will provide the highest margin of wind power that can be integrated at a particular load condition without violating frequency response constraints. The proposed technique is applied and analysed for a 250 bus, 65 machine Australian electricity network. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Frequency response of wind farm; Maximum wind penetration level; Power system security","(2014), http://www.gwec.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GWEC_GlobalWindStats2014_FINAL_10.2.2015.pdf, [accessed 18.03.15](2010), http://www.nerc.com/FilingsOrders/us/FERCOrdersRules/Interconnection_Frequency_Performance.pdf, Review of the Recent Frequency Performance of the Eastern, Western and ERCOT Interconnections, Dec.

As the share of renewable electricity in such markets grows, so too do the challenges associated with its variability. Proposed solutions to these challenges typically focus on alternatives to primary generation, such as energy storage, demand side management, or increased interconnection. Less attention is given to the demands placed on conventional thermal generation or its potential for increased flexibility. However, for the foreseeable future, conventional plants will have to operate alongside new renewables and have an essential role in accommodating increasing supply-side variability.This paper explores the role that conventional generation has to play in managing variability through the sub-system case study of Northern Ireland, identifying the significance of specific plant characteristics for reliable system operation. Particular attention is given to the challenges of wind ramping and the need to avoid excessive wind curtailment. Potential for conflict is identified with the role for conventional plant in addressing these two challenges. Market specific strategies for using the existing fleet of generation to reduce the impact of renewable resource variability are proposed, and wider lessons from the approach taken are identified. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Conventional generation; Flexibility; Intermittency; Ramping; Variability; Wind curtailment","(2012), Transmission Constraint Groups: March 2012.; March(2010), A strategic framework for Northern Ireland; SeptemberConnolly, D., Lund, H., Mathiesen, B.V., Pican, E., Leahy, M., The technical and economic implications of integrating fluctuating renewable energy using energy storage (2012) Renew Energy, 43, pp. 47-60. , Jul; Tuohy, A., O'Malley, M., Pumped storage in systems with very high wind penetration (2011) Energy Policy, 39 (4), pp. 1965-1974. , Apr; Denholm, P., Hand, M., Grid flexibility and storage required to achieve very high penetration of variable renewable electricity (2011) Energy Policy, 39 (3), pp. 1817-1830. , Mar; Bove, R., Bucher, M., Ferretti, F., Integrating large shares of wind energy in macro-economical cost-effective way (2012) Energy, 43 (1), pp. 438-447. , Jul; De Vos, K., Petoussis, A.G., Driesen, J., Belmans, R., Revision of reserve requirements following wind power integration in island power systems (2013) Renew Energy, 50, pp. 268-279. , Feb; Hong, L., Lund, H., Möller, B., The importance of flexible power plant operation for Jiangsu's wind integration (2012) Energy, 41 (1), pp. 499-507. , May; (2011), SONI Grid Code; 22-FebKlinge Jacobsen, H., Schröder, S.T., Curtailment of renewable generation: economic optimality and incentives.

There is therefore a need for such systems to not only cope with, but to thrive under such fluctuating flow conditions. This paper addresses the potential importance of gust tracking technologies within the urban environment via the analysis of the additional energy present in the gusty wind resource using high resolution measurements at two urban roof-top locations. Results demonstrate significant additional energy present in the gusty wind resource at high temporal resolution. This energy is usually under-represented by the use of mean wind speeds in quantifying the power in the wind over longer averaging times. The results support the promise of capturing a portion of this extra energy through gust tracking solutions. The sensitivity of this ""additional"" wind energy to averaging time interval is also explored, providing useful information for the design of gust tracking or dynamic control algorithms for small-scale turbines. Relationships between turbulence intensity and excess energy available are drawn. Thus, an analytical model is proposed which may prove useful in predicting the excess energy available across wide areas from, for example, boundary layer turbulence models. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Excess energy content; Small-scale vertical-axis wind turbine; Turbulence intensity; Urban wind","(2008) Climate change act 2008, , The Stationary Office, London, UK; (2008) Energy act 2008, , The Stationary Office, London, UK; Baskut, O., Ozgener, O., Ozgener, L., Second law analysis of wind turbine power plants: Cesme, Izmir example (2011) Energy, 36 (5), pp. 2535-2542; Baskut, O., Ozgener, O., Ozgener, L., Effects of meteorological variables on exergetic efficiency of wind turbine power plants (2010) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 14 (9), pp. 3237-3241; Allen, S.R., Hammond, G.P., McManus, M.C., Prospects for and barriers to domestic micro-generation: a United Kingdom perspective (2008) Appl Energy, 85 (6), pp. 528-544; (2010) Small wind systems, UK market report, , UK; Britter, R., Hanna, S., Flow and dispersion in urban areas (2003) Annu Rev Fluid Mech, 35 (1), pp. 469-496; McIntosh, S., Babinsky, H., Bertenyi, T., Optimizing the energy output of vertical axis wind turbines for fluctuating wind conditions (2007) 45th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, , American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics; Van der Hoven, I., Power spectrum of horizontal wind speed in the frequency range from 0.0007 to 900 cycles per hour (1957) JMeteorol, 14 (2), pp. 160-164; Howell, R., Qin, N., Edwards, J., Durrani, N., Wind tunnel and numerical study of a small vertical axis wind turbine (2010) Renew Energy, 35 (2), pp. 412-422; Pedersen, T., On wind turbine power performance measurements at inclined airflow (2004) Wind Energy, 7 (3), pp. 163-176; Aslam Bhutta, M.M., Hayat, N., Farooq, A.U., Ali, Z., Jamil, S.R., Hussain, Z., Vertical axis wind turbine - a review of various configurations and design techniques (2012) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 16 (4), pp. 1926-1939; Danao, L.A., Eboibi, O., Howell, R., An experimental investigation into the influence of unsteady wind on the performance of a vertical axis wind turbine (2013) Appl Energy, 107, pp. 403-411; Scelba, G., Consoli, A., Gust tracking capability of small direct-drive wind turbines (2010) Sustainable Energy Technologies (ICSET), 2010 IEEE International Conference, pp. 1-6. , IEEE; Acosta, J.L., Combe, K., Djokic, S.Z., Hernando-Gil, I., Performance assessment of micro and small-scale wind turbines in urban areas (2012) Syst J IEEE, 6 (1), pp. 152-163; Hanna, S.R., Brown, M.J., Camelli, F.E., Chan, S.T., Coirier, W.J., Kim, S., Detailed simulations of atmospheric flow and dispersion in downtown Manhattan: an application of five computational fluid dynamics models (2006) Bull Am Meteorological Soc, 87 (12), pp. 1713-1726; Wieringa, J., Gust factors over open water and built-up country (1973) Boundary-Layer Meteorol, 3 (4), pp. 424-441; Jackson, P., The evaluation of windy environments (1978) Build Environ, 13 (4), pp. 251-260; Millward-Hopkins, J.T., Tomlin, A.S., Ma, L., Ingham, D., Pourkashanian, M., Estimating aerodynamic parameters of urban-like surfaces with heterogeneous building heights (2011) Boundary-Layer Meteorol, 141 (3), pp. 443-465; Eliasson, I., Offerle, B., Grimmond, C.S.B., Lindqvist, S., Wind fields and turbulence statistics in an urban street canyon (2006) Atmos Environ, 40, pp. 1-16; Rafailidis, S., Influence of building areal density and roof shape on the wind characteristics above a town (1997) Boundary-Layer Meteorol, 85 (2), pp. 255-271; Bertényi, T., Wickins, C., McIntosh, S., Enhanced energy capture through gust-tracking in the urban wind environment (2010) 48th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Orlando, Florida, USA; Shamshirband, S., Petković, D., Saboohi, H., Anuar, N.B., Inayat, I., Akib, S., Wind turbine power coefficient estimation by soft computing methodologies: comparative study (2014) Energy Convers Manag, 81, pp. 520-526; Abdullah, M., Yatim, A., Tan, C., Saidur, R., Areview of maximum power point tracking algorithms for wind energy systems (2012) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 16 (5), pp. 3220-3227; Penna, P., (2008) Wind tunnel tests of the Quiet Revolution Ltd.

The SM control is applied to simultaneously match 1) the maximum power generation of the wind turbine system from the wind with 2) the maximum power injection of the grid-connected power converter into the grid. The amount of energy extractable from a dynamically changing wind using the WECS with SM control is compared with that of classic PI control. Both the simulation and experimental results show that more energy can be harvested with the SM control as compared to the PI control for any dynamically changing or random wind conditions. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","maximum power generation (MPG); maximum power injection (MPI); sliding mode control; Variable structure control; wind energy conversion system (WECS)","Muyeen, S.M., Takahashi, R., Murata, T., Tamura, J., Integration of an energy capacitor system with a variable-speed wind generator (2009) IEEE Trans.

This study analyzes integrating wave energy into the grid, in conjunction with wind and solar. The Pacific Northwest in the United States has a favorable mix of all three sources. Load and wind power series are obtained from government databases. Solar power is calculated from 12 sites over five states. Wave energy is calculated using buoy data, simulations of the ECMWF model, and power matrices for three types of wave energy converters. At the short horizons required for planning, the properties of the load and renewable energy are dissimilar. The load exhibits cycles at 24h and seven days, seasonality and long-term trending. Solar power is dominated by the diurnal cycle and by seasonality, but also exhibits nonlinear variability due to cloud cover, atmospheric turbidity and precipitation. Wind power is dominated by large ramp events-irregular transitions between states of high and low power. Wave energy exhibits seasonal cycles and is generally smoother, although there are still some large transitions, particularly during winter months. Forecasting experiments are run over horizons of 1-4h for the load and all three types of renewable energy. Waves are found to be more predictable than wind and solar. The forecast error at 1h for the simulated wave farms is in the range of 5-7 percent, while the forecast errors for solar and wind are 17 and 22 percent. Geographic dispersal increases forecast accuracy. At the 1h horizon, the forecast error for large-scale wave farms is 39-49 percent lower than at individual buoys.

This paper presents the offshore wind resource map of the Gulf of Thailand, with the objective of identifying the potential areas for grid connected offshore wind power development. A coupled numerical mesoscale atmospheric model and a microscale wind flow model, along with long-term global reanalysis climate data, are used to generate high resolution (200m) wind resource maps at heights of 40m, 80m, 100m, and 120m above sea level. The offshore wind resource maps are validated using measured wind speeds obtained from 28 meteorological towers installed along the coast of the Gulf of Thailand. The site selection of potential areas for offshore wind power development is assessed with a multi-criteria decision making analysis. Specifically to the Bay of Bangkok, results show that a technical power potential in the order of 3000MW could be developed to generate an annual energy production estimated in the order of 6TWh/year. For the whole Gulf of Thailand, a technical power potential estimated at 7000MW could generate in the order of 15TWh/year. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Atmospheric modeling; Technical power potential; Wind energy; Wind power; Wind resource assessment","(2013) World energy outlook 2013, , http://www.iea.org, Available at:; (2013) Global wind report, annual market update, , http://www.gwec.net, Available at:; (2014) Climate change 2014-mitigation of climate change, , http://www.ipcc.ch, Available at:; Raadal, H.L., Vold, B.I., Myhr, A., Nygaard, T.A., GHG emission and energy performance of offshore wind power (2014) Renew Energy, 66, pp. 314-324; Chingulpitak, S., Wongwises, S., Critical review of the current status of wind power in Thailand (2014) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 31, pp. 312-318; Landry, M., Leclerc, A., Gagnon, Y., Amethodology for the evaluation of the economic impacts of wind energy projects in Canada (2013) Energy Environ, 24, pp. 735-748; Katsigiannis, Y.A., Stavrakakis, G.S., Estimation of wind energy production in various sites in Australia for different wind turbine classes: a comparative technical and economic assessment (2014) Renew Energy, 67, pp. 230-236; Abbasi, T., Premalatha, M., Abbasi, T., Abbasi, S.A., Wind energy: increasing deployment, rising environmental concerns (2014) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 31, pp. 270-288; Perveen, R., Kishor, N., Mohanty, S.R., Off-shore wind farm development: present status and challenges (2014) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 29, pp. 780-792; Adelaja, A., McKewon, C., Calnin, B., Hailu, Y., Assessing offshore wind potential (2012) Energy Policy, 42, pp. 191-200; Zheng, C.W., Pan, J., Assessment of the global ocean wind energy resource (2014) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 33, pp. 382-391; Waewsak, J., Landry, M., Gagnon, Y., High resolution wind atlas for Nakhon Si Thammarat and Songkhla provinces, Thailand (2013) Renew Energy, 53, pp. 101-110; Hernandez Escobedo, Q., Saldana Flores, R., Rodriguez Garcia, E.R., Manzano Agugliaro, F., Wind energy resource in northern Mexico (2014) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 32, pp. 890-914; Fang, H.F., Wind energy potential assessment for the offshore areas of Taiwan west coast and Penghu Archipelago (2014) Renew Energy, 67, pp. 237-241; Santos-Alamillos, F.J., Pozo-Vazequez, D., Ruiz-Arias, J.A., Lara-Fanego, V., Tovar-Pescador, J., Amethodology for evaluating the spatial variability of wind energy resources: application to assess the potential contribution of wind energy to base load power (2014) Renew Energy, 69, pp. 145-156; Oh, K.Y., Kim, J.Y., Lee, J.K., Ryu, M.S., Lee, J.S., Assessment of wind energy potential at the demonstration offshore wind farm in Korea (2012) Energy, 46, pp. 555-563; Sheridan, B., Baker, S.D., Pearre, N.S., Firestone, J., Kempton, W., Calculating the offshore wind power resource: robust assessment methods applied to the U.S. Atlantic coast (2012) Renew Energy, 43, pp. 224-233; Beaucage, P., Lafrance, G., Lafrance, J., Choisnard, J., Bernier, M., Synthetic aperture radar satellite data for offshore wind assessment: a strategic sampling approach (2011) JWind Eng Ind Aerodynamics, 99, pp. 27-36; Jiang, D., Zhuang, D., Huang, Y., Wang, J., Fu, J., Evaluating the spatio-temporal variation of China's offshore wind resources based on remotely sensed wind field data (2013) Renew Energy Sustain Rev, 24, pp. 142-148; Dhanju, A., Whitaker, P., Kempton, W., Assessing offshore wind resources: an accessible methodology (2008) Renew Energy, 33, pp. 55-64; Moller, B., Hong, L., Lonsing, R., Hvelplund, F., Evaluation of offshore wind resources by scale of development (2012) Energy, 48, pp. 314-322; Xiliang, Z., Da, Z., Stua, M., Kickoff of offshore wind power in China: playoffs for China wind power development (2012) Proc Environ Sci, 12, pp. 166-173; Prassler, T., Schaechtele, J., Comparison of the financial attractiveness among prospective offshore wind parks in selected European countries (2012) Energy Policy, 45, pp. 86-101; http://sql.ldd.go.th/ldddata/, map scale 1:50000.

This paper presents some of the new designs that are being tested, including slotted blades and tubercles design models. The experimental results are used to validate the numerical studies that are being conducted parallel to the experiments for better understanding and more detailed results. The new slotted blade design produced more power compared to the straight blade for lower wind speeds, while the tubercle blades showed better power performance in severe wind conditions and a more steady behavior under unsteady and higher wind velocities.

A large share will come from the variable renewable energy (VRE) sources wind and solar photovoltaics (PV); however, integrating wind and solar causes challenges for existing power systems. In this paper we analyze three major integration challenges related to the structural matching of demand with the supply of wind and solar power: low capacity credit, reduced utilization of dispatchable plants, and over-produced generation. Based on residual load duration curves we define corresponding challenge variables and estimate their dependence on region (US Indiana and Germany), penetration and mix of wind and solar generation. Results show that the impacts of increasing wind and solar shares can become substantial, and increase with penetration, independently of mix and region. Solar PV at low penetrations is much easier to integrate in many areas of the US than in Germany; however, some impacts (e.g. over-production) increase significantly with higher shares. For wind power, the impacts increase rather moderately and are fairly similar in US Indiana and Germany. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Capacity credit; Integration; Residual load duration curves; Solar; Variable renewables; Wind","(2014) Renewables 2014 global status report, , REN21 Secretariat, Paris; (2013) Renewables 2013 global status report, , REN21 Secretariat, Paris; (2014) Conclusions on the 2030 framework for climate and energy policies, , http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/145397.pdf, [accessed on 14.03.15]; (2011) Energy roadmap 2050; Edenhofer, O., Knopf, B., Barker, T., Baumstark, L., Bellevrat, E., Chateau, B., The economics of low stabilization: model comparison of mitigation strategies and costs (2010) Energy J, 31 (1), pp. 11-48; (2011) Special report on renewable energy sources and climate change mitigation, , Cambridge University Press, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA; Krey, V., Clarke, L., Role of renewable energy in climate mitigation: a synthesis of recent scenarios (2011) Clim Policy, 11 (4), pp. 1131-1158; Luderer, G., Bosetti, V., Jakob, M., Leimbach, M., Steckel, J.C., Waisman, H., The economics of decarbonizing the energy system-results and insights from the RECIPE model intercomparison (2012) Clim Change, 114 (1), pp. 9-37. , Sep; (2012) Global energy assessment - toward a sustainable future, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg, Austria; Luderer, G., Krey, V., Calvin, K., Merrick, J., Mima, S., Pietzcker, R., The role of renewable energy in climate stabilization: results from the EMF27 scenarios (2014) Clim Change, 123 (3-4), pp. 427-441. , Apr; Milligan, M., Kirby, B., (2009) Calculating wind integration costs: separating wind energy value from integration cost impacts, , [NREL Technical Report TP-550-46275]; Holttinen, H., Meibom, P., Orths, A., Lange, B., O'Malley, M., Tande, J.O., Impacts of large amounts of wind power on design and operation of power systems, results of IEA collaboration (2011) Wind Energy, 14 (2), pp. 179-192; Katzenstein, W., Apt, J., The cost of wind power variability (2012) Energy Policy, 51, pp. 233-243. , Dec; Holttinen, H., OMalley, M., Dillon, J., Flynn, D., Keane, A., Abildgaard, H., Steps for a complete wind integration study (2013) Presented at the 46th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences proceedings, pp. 2261-2270; Ueckerdt, F., Hirth, L., Luderer, G., Edenhofer, O., System LCOE: what are the costs of variable renewables?

These wind regimes are often governed by low mean speeds and high wind turbulence. This can result in energy production less than that specified by the manufacturer's power curve. Wind turbulence is detrimental to the fatigue life of key components and overall turbine reliability and therefore must be considered in the design stage of small wind turbines. Consequently it is important to accurately simulate wind speed data at highly turbulent sites to quantify loading on turbine components. Here we simulate wind speed data using the Markov chain Monte Carlo process and incorporate long term effects using an embedded Markov chain. First, second and third order Markov chain predictions were found to be in good agreement with measured wind data acquired at 1Hz. The embedded Markov chain was able to predict site turbulent intensity with a reasonable degree of accuracy. The site exhibited distinctive peaks in wind speed possibly caused by diurnal heating and cooling of the earth's surface. The embedded Markov chain method was able to simulate these peaks albeit with a time offset. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Markov chain; Wind modelling; Wind turbines","Wilson, S.V.R., Clausen, P.D., Aspects of the dynamic response of a small wind turbine blade in highly turbulent flow: part 1 measured blade response (2007) Wind Eng, 31, pp. 1-16; Wood, D.H., Dual purpose design of small wind turbine blades (2004) Wind Eng, 28, pp. 511-528; Clausen, P., Wood, D., Recent advances in small wind turbine technology (2000) Wind Eng, 24, pp. 189-201; Epaarachchi, J.A., Clausen, P.D., The development of a fatigue loading spectrum for small wind turbine blades (2006) Jwind Eng Ind Aerodyn, 94, pp. 207-223; Whale, J., McHenry, M.P., Malla, A., Scheduling and conducting power performance testing of a small wind turbine (2013) Renew Energy, 55, pp. 55-61; NSW Small Wind Turbine Consumer Guide (2010), http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/climatechange/0449SWCG.pdf, [accessed on: MarchMilivojevic, N., Stamenkovic, I., Schofield, N., Power and energy analysis of commercial small wind turbine systems (2010) Industrial technology (ICIT), 2010 IEEE International Conference on, IEEE, pp. 1739-1744; Roy, A., Rathod, A., Kulkarni, G., Challenges to diffusion of small wind turbines in India (2013) Renewable Power Generation Conference (RPG 2013), 2nd IET, IET, pp. 1-4; Jones, D.I., Lorenz, M.H., An application of a Markov chain noise model to wind generator simulation (1986) Math Comput Simul, 28, pp. 391-402; Sahin, A.D., Sen, Z., First-order Markov chain approach to wind speed modelling (2001) JWind Eng Ind Aerodyn, 89, pp. 263-269; Ettoumi, F.Y., Sauvageot, H., Adane, A.E.H., Statistical bivariate modelling of wind using first-order Markov chain and Weibull distribution (2003) Renew Energy, 28, pp. 1787-1802; Nfaoui, H., Essiarab, H., Sayigh, A.A.M., Astochastic Markov chain model for simulating wind speed time series at Tangiers, Morocco (2004) Renew Energy, 29, pp. 1407-1418; Hocaoglu, F., Gerek, O., Kurban, M., The effect of Markov chain state size for synthetic wind speed generation (2008) Probabilistic methods applied to power systems, 2008.

Wind power forecasting based only on historical wind power data is carried out in this work. In a first treatment to the wind power data, Phase Space Reconstruction (PSR) is used to reconstruct the phase space of the wind dynamical system. Secondly, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is used to minimize the influence from improper selection of the delay time and phase dimension. Finally, a prediction model, using Resource Allocating Network (RAN), is built for nonlinear mapping between the historical wind power data and the forecasting. Performance of the proposed method is compared with Persistence (PER), New-Reference (NR), and Adaptive Wavelet Neural Network (AWNN) models by using data from the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Analysis results indicate that the forecasting error of the proposed method is about 3% for 48 look-ahead hours, which is remarkably below the errors obtained with other forecast methods and has a probability close to 80% for 48 look-ahead hours forecasting within 12.5% error. The proposed method can also forecast wind power for turbines of different capacity and at different elevations below 10% error. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Phase space construction; Principle component analysis; Resource allocating networks; Wind power forecasting","Tascikaraoglun, A., Uzunoglu, M., Areview of combined approaches for prediction of short-term wind speed and power (2014) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 34, pp. 243-254; Georgilakis, P.S., Technical challenges associated with the integration of wind power into power systems (2008) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 12 (3), pp. 852-863; Smith, J.C., Utility wind integration and operating impact state of the art (2007) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 22 (3), pp. 900-908; Giebel, G., Brownsword, R., Kariniotakis, G., Denhard, M., Draxl, C., (2011) The state-of-the art in short-term prediction of wind power: a literature overview, , ANEMOS Plus; Costa, A., Crespo, A., Navarro, J., Lizcano, G., Madsen, H., Feitosa, E., Areview of the young history of wind power short-term prediction (2008) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 12, pp. 1725-1744; Torres, J.L., Garcia, A., De Blas, M., De Francisco, A., Forecast of hourly average wind speed with ARMA models in Navarre (Spain) (2005) Sol Energy, 79, pp. 65-77; Kavassery, R., Seetharaman, K., Day-ahead wind speed forecasting using f-ARIMA models (2009) Renew Energy, 34, pp. 1388-1393; Madsen, H., Kariniotakis, G., Nielsen, H., Nielsen, T.S., Pinson, P., Aprotocol for standardizing the performance evaluation of short-term wind power prediction models (2004) Proceedings of the global wind power conference and exhibition, Chicago (US), pp. 28-31; Madsen, H., Pinson, P., Kariniotakis, G., Nielsen, H.A., Nielsen, T.S., Standardizing the performance evaluation of short-term wind power prediction models (2005) Wind Eng, 29 (6), pp. 475-489; Sideratos, G., Hatziargyriou, N.D., Probabilistic wind power forecasting using radial basis function neural network (2012) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 27, pp. 1788-1796; Foley, A.M., Leahy, P.G., Marvuglia, A., McKeogh, E.J., Current methods and advances in forecasting of wind power generation (2012) Renew Energy, 37, pp. 1-8; Zhang, Y., Wang, J., Wang, X., Review on probabilistic forecasting of wind power generation (2014) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 32, pp. 255-270; Wan, C., Xu, Z., Pinson, P., Dong, Z.Y., Wong, K.P., Probabilistic forecasting of wind power generation using extreme learning machine (2014) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 29 (3), pp. 1033-1044; Alessandrini, S., Delle Monache, L., Sperati, S., Nissen, J.N., Anovel application of an analog ensemble for short-term wind power forecasting (2015) Renew Energy, 76, pp. 768-781; Bhaskar, K., Singhs, S.N., AWNN-assisted wind power forecasting using feed-forward neural network (2012) IEEE Trans Sustain Energy, 3 (2), pp. 306-315; Lijie, W., Lei, D., Guofei, H., Shuang, G., Xiaozhong, L., Combined prediction of wind power generation in multi-dimension embedding phase space (2010) Control Decis, 25 (4), pp. 577-581; Lei, H., Jie, S., Guixiu, J., Jiyuan, Z., Photovoltaic generation forecast based on multidimensional time-series and local support vector regression in microgrids (2014) Automation Electr Power Syst, 38 (5), pp. 19-24; Catalao, J.P.S., Hybrid wavelet-PSO-ANFIS approach for short-term wind power forecasting in Portugal (2010) IEEE Trans Sustain Energy, 2 (1), pp. 50-59; Osorio, G.J., Matias, J.C.O., Catalao, J.P.S., Short-term wind power forecasting using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system combined with evolutionary particle swarm optimization, wavelet transform and mutual information (2015) Renew Energy, 75, pp. 301-307; Lei, D., Lijie, W., Shuang, G., Xiaozhong, L., Modeling and analysis of prediction of wind power generation in the large wind farm based on chaotic time series (2008) Trans China Electrotech Soc, 23 (12), pp. 125-129; Jia, T., Hong, Z., Guorong, Z., Meng, Z., Quanming, Z., Wind power prediction based on technology of advanced phase space reconstruction (2011) Proc CSEE, 31 (28), pp. 9-14; Takens, F., (1981) Dynamical systems and turbulence, pp. 366-381. , Springer Verlag Press, Berlin; Packard, N.H., Crutchfield, J.P., Farmer, J.D., Geometry from a time series (1980) Phys Rev Lett, 45 (3), pp. 712-716; Albano, A.M., Muench, J., Schwartz, C., Singular-value decomposition and the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm (1988) Phys Rev A, 38 (6), pp. 3017-3026; Kugiumtzis, D., State space reconstruction parameters in the analysis of chaotic time series - the role of the time window length (1996) Phys D, 95 (1), pp. 13-28; Kim, H.S., Eykholt, R., Salas, J.D., Nonlinear dynamics delay times and embedding windows (1999) Phys D, 127 (1), pp. 48-60; Min, H., (2007) Prediction theory and method of chaotic time series, , China Water & Power Press; David, C.C., Jacobs, D.J., Principal component analysis: a method for determining the essential dynamics of proteins.

Mean streamwise velocities in two bladed turbine near wakes ranged between 10 and 100% larger than those in the three bladed case with large differences just behind the nacelle. In the rotor swept region of far wakes, mean velocity differences between the two arrays were about 10% (max) and became smaller with increasing streamwise direction. Contrary to these findings, regions above and below rotors become less similar deep in the array. Incoming flow to downstream turbines was shown to have greater Reynolds streamwise normal stress for three bladed rotors. Percentage differences ranged between about 30% for the second turbine down to 10% for the fourth turbine. Additionally, there is qualitative evidence that suggests incoming streamwise Reynolds normal stress becomes similar between the two types of turbines, indicating that asymptotically two and three bladed turbines could have similar fatigue loading properties. These results show that use of two bladed turbines would have the most impact when used in a wind farm's first two rows. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Array performance; Blade number effects; Turbulence; Wind energy","Ainslie, J., Development of an eddy viscosity model for wind turbine wakes (1985) 7th BWEA wind energy conference proceedings; Barthelmie, R., Hansen, K., Frandsen, S., Rathmann, O., Schepers, J., Schlez, W., Modeling and measuring flow and wind turbine wakes in large wind farms offshore (2009) Wind Energy, 12, pp. 431-444; Barthelmie, R., Pryor, S., Frandsen, S., Hansen, K., Schepers, J., Rados, K., Quantifying the impact of wind turbine wakes on power output at offshore wind farms (2010) JAtmos Ocean Technol, 27, pp. 1302-1317; Barthelmie, R., Rathmann, O., Frandsen, S., Hansen, K., Politis, E., Prospathopoulos, J., Modeling and measurements of wakes in large wind farms (2007) JPhys Conf Ser, 75, p. 012049; Barthelmie, R.J., Frandsen, S.T., Nielsen, M.N., Pryor, S.C., Rethore, P.-E., Jrgensen, H.E., Power losses and turbulence intensity in wind turbine wakes at middelgrunden offshore wind farm (2007) Wind Energy, 10, pp. 517-528; Bazilevs, Y., Hsu, M., Akkerman, I., Wright, S., Takizawa, K., Henicke, B., 3D simulation of wind turbine rotors at full scale.

Fatigue behavior of hybrid as well as glass and carbon fiber reinforced composites with and without secondary CNT reinforcement is simulated using multiscale 3D unit cells. The materials behavior under both mechanical cyclic loading and combined mechanical and environmental loading (with phase properties degraded due to the moisture effects) is studied. The multiscale unit cells are generated automatically using the Python based code. 3D computational studies of environment and fatigue analyses of multiscale composites with secondary nano-scale reinforcement in different material phases and different CNTs arrangements are carried out systematically in this paper. It was demonstrated that composites with the secondary CNT reinforcements (especially, aligned tubes) present superior fatigue performances than those without reinforcements, also under combined environmental and cyclic mechanical loading. This effect is stronger for carbon composites, than for hybrid and glass composites. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","A. Carbon nanotubes; A. Nano composites; B. Fatigue; C.

Based on the Jensen wake model with the Katic wake superposition rule, the potential gain for the Nysted offshore wind farm is calculated to be 1.4-5.4% for standard choices 0.4 ≥ k≥0.25 of the wake expansion parameter. Wake model fits based on short time intervals of length 15sec ≤ T≤10min within three months of data reveal a strong wake flow variability, resulting in rather broad distributions for the wake expansion parameter. When an optimized wind-farm control strategy, derived from a fixed wake parameter, is facing this flow variability, the potential gain reduces to 0.3-0.5%. An omnipotent control strategy, which has real-time knowledge of the actual wake flow, would be able to increase the gain in wind-farm power to 4.9%. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Flow variability; Model-based data analysis;

First, the derated characteristics of PMSG systems with various ac/dc converters and operation controls are comparatively analyzed. Then, the IPMSG followed by a three-phase Vienna switch-mode rectifier is developed to establish the common dc bus of dc microgrid. Good developed power and voltage regulation characteristics are achieved via the proposed commutation tuning, robust current, and voltage controls. Second, a single-phase three-wire inverter is constructed to serve as the test load. Good ac 220 V/110 V output voltage waveforms under unknown and nonlinear loads are preserved by the developed robust waveform tracking control scheme. Third, a battery energy storage system is established, and the fast energy storage support response is obtained via the proposed droop control approach with adaptive predictive current control method. In addition, a chopped dump load is equipped to enhance the energy balance control flexibility. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","1P3W inverter; BESS; commutation tuning; droop control; dump load; IPMSG; predictive current control; robust control; SMR; Vienna; wind generator","Loh, P.C., Li, D., Chai, Y.K., Blaabjerg, F., Autonomous operation of hybrid microgrid with AC and DC subgrids (2013) IEEE Trans.

We chose a set of observations which include currents, hydrography and meteorological data obtained in Alfacs Bay (NW Mediterranean Sea). Short-term response to energetic wind events was found in the hydrography and water velocity observations, sometimes inverting the estuarine circulation or developing one-layered flow. In comparison to previous investigations in Alfacs Bay, we observed that water current variability, and also maximum velocities, were directly related to the development of surface standing waves (i.e. seiches). Mixing mechanisms versus buoyancy sources are studied through potential energy anomaly equation, proving the leading freshwater contribution to stratification, enhanced by heat fluxes in summer. On the other hand, mixing is directly related to winds, mainly in winter and early spring when both buoyancy forces are lower. We also study turbulent bottom mixing by seiches through observations, dimensionless relations and numerical modeling. Seiche induced mixing is suggested as an eventual mechanism that may break the stratification within the Bay under special circumstances. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","0.5°-0.8°E; 40.5°-40.7°N; Alfacs Bay; Ebro Delta; Estuarine dynamics; High frequency; Mediterranean Sea; Micro-tidal; Seiches; Water mixing","Allen, R., Pereira, L.S., Raes, D., Smith, M., Crop evapotranspiration: guidelines for computing crop requirements (1998) Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56, , FAO; Atkinson, L.P., Blanton, J.O., Processes that affect stratification in the shelf 504 waters (1986) Coastal Estuarine Sci, 3, pp. 117-130. , AGU, Washington, D.C., (505), C.N.K.

Fermi, 5, Firenze, Italy, Gran Sasso Science Institute (INFN), Viale F. Crispi 7, L'Aquila, Italy","While from the energetic point of view supernova remnants are viable sources of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs), the issue of whether they can accelerate protons up to a few PeV remains unsolved. Here we discuss particle acceleration at the forward shock of supernovae, and discuss the possibility that the current of escaping particles may excite a non-resonant instability that in turn leads to the formation of resonant modes that confine particles close to the shock, thereby increasing the maximum energy. This mechanism is at work throughout the expansion of the supernova explosion, from the ejecta dominated (ED) phase to the Sedov-Taylor (ST) phase. The transition from one stage to the other reflects in a break in the spectrum of injected particles. Because of their higher explosion rate, we focus our work on type II SNe expanding in the slow, dense wind, produced by the red super-giant progenitor stars. When the explosion occurs in such winds, the transition between the ED and the ST phase is likely to take place within a few tens of years. The highest energies are reached at even earlier times, when, however, a small fraction of the mass of ejecta has been processed. As a result, the spectrum of accelerated particles shows a break in the slope, at an energy that is the maximum energy (EM) achieved at the beginning of the ST phase. Above this characteristic energy, the spectrum becomes steeper but remains a power law rather than developing an exponential cutoff. An exponential cut is eventually present at much higher energies but it does not have a phenomenological relevance. We show that for parameters typical of type II supernovae, EM for protons can easily reach values in the PeV range, confirming that type II SNRs are the best candidate sources for CRs at the knee. From the point of view of implications of this scenario on the measured particle spectra, we have tried to fit KASCADE-Grande, ARGO -YBJ and YAC1-Tibet Array data with our model but we could not find any combination of the parameters that could explain all data sets. Indeed the recent measurement of the proton and helium spectra in the knee region, with the ARGO-YBJ and YAC1-Tibet Array, has made the situation very confused. These measurements suggest that the knee in the light component is at ∼650 TeV, appreciably below the knee in the overall spectrum. On one hand this finding would resolve the problem of reaching very high energies in supernovae, but on the other it would open a critical issue in the transition region between Galactic and extragalactic CRs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The Isle of Eigg in Scotland has been successfully using a hybrid off-grid system for several years to provide a reliable 24-h electricity supply to the islanders. This ex-post analysis of the Isle of Eigg system investigates its performance and explores possible alternative configurations which could work more effectively and efficiently. Simulations were carried out using HOMER software for the existing system and for alternative configurations of energy generation. It is found that the existing overcapacity has been instrumental in ensuring a reliable supply but continued reliance on diesel generators adds to the cost. More wind power capacity addition can reduce reliance on fossil fuels and modular sizing of generators instead of adding large capacities could have reduced the idle capacity. This experience suggests that providing reliable off-grid electricity supply is possible but is costly without suitable capital subsidies. Appropriate system design suited to the local condition is important for developing a viable system. © 2015 The Authors.","Hybrid system; Isle of eigg; Off-grid electricity; Reliable supply","(2013) World energy outlook, energy access database, , http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/resources/energydevelopment/energyaccessdatabase/#d.en.8609, [online] EIA.

Approximately 155,000 rural households remain without access to electricity in the Amazon Region, conforming very isolated communities that cannot be supplied by the expansion of the existing grid. To supply electricity to these communities, off-grid generation through diesel fuel has traditionally been the only option considered. The Amazon Region has a huge potential in renewable energy, specially: hydraulic, biomass and biofuels, solar as well as wind in the coast. The Brazilian Government has started to consider the use of these local renewable sources for the electrification of isolated communities. Several experimental projects have been deployed, supplying electrical power through appropriated off-grid renewable energy technologies: run-of-the-river and hydrokynetic, biomass (direct burning or gasification), biofuels and vegetable oils, and hybrid (solar-wind-diesel). Regarding these technologies, the most significant projects conducted in the region were evaluated. Analyzing the costs, technical and social issues as well as the performance of these systems, after a 10 year's evaluation period, this paper shows that some renewable energy technologies have proven to be a more convenient and economic option than electricity generation through diesel, in these isolated communities. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

By analyzing five basic isolated dc-dc converters, four isolated pulsating voltage source cells and three isolated pulsating current source cells are generated. Moreover, a semiisolated multiinput converter (S-MIC) for hybrid PV/wind power charger system which can simplify the power system, reduce the cost, deliver continuous power, and overcome high-voltage-transfer-ratio problems is proposed. In this paper, the operational principle of the proposed S-MIC is explained, the small-signal ac model is derived, and the controller design is developed.

The promotion of renewable energy technologies should thus be as effective and efficient as possible. Therefore, support schemes should explicitly consider the balance between demand-pull (e.g. production subsidies) and supply-push efforts (public RD&D investments). In this paper we estimate the deployment costs for renewable generation technologies between 2005 and 2030 in the EU-27. Then, we relate our findings to public RD&D expenditures (2005-2010) on these technologies. Based on several ""lags"" between RD&D spending and market impact, we obtained cumulative pull/push ratios between 100 and 190 for wind technologies and between 80 and 210 for PV. For solid biomass, pull/push ratios are lower, in a range of 60-120. The imbalance for biogas is much larger; the cumulative pull/push ratio for biogas is about 700 in the '5 year lag' case and about 1200 in the other cases (10 yr. lag or more). Although the debate on optimal RD&D efforts is not conclusive and very sector-specific, it is relevant to compare our findings to average pull/push ratios of about 20 in the engineering sector.

To investigate these relationships the hydrodynamic characteristics of straight and helical-bladed vertical axis turbines were investigated using Three-Dimensional (3D) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models using a commercial Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) solver. Simulations of power output, torque oscillations, and mounting forces were performed for turbines with overlap angles from 0° to 120° and section inclination angles from-15° to 45°. Results indicated that straight-bladed turbines with 0° blade overlap generated the highest power output. Helical turbines were found to generate decreasing power outputs as blade overlap angle increased due to the resultant blade inclination to the inflow. Blade section inclination to the inflow was also found to influence power output. Some benefits of helical-bladed turbines over their straight-bladed counterparts were established; helical turbine torque oscillation levels and mounting forces were reduced when compared to straight-bladed turbines. For both straight and helical-bladed turbines maximum mounting force levels were found to exceed the average force levels by more than 40%, with large cyclical loading forces identified. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Computational fluid dynamics;

DIN deposition exhibited an increasing gradient from north to south, with N-NH4+ as the predominant contributor. DIN deposition in precipitation changed after interaction with the forest canopy, and serious ecological perturbations are expected in this region. DIN deposition presented seasonal fluctuations, which might be ascribed to agricultural activity, fossil-fuel combustion and environmental factors (i.e., wind direction, soil temperature). Notably, N fertilizer use (F<inf>N</inf>), energy consumption (E), and precipitation (P) jointly explained 84.3% of the spatial variation in DIN deposition, of which F<inf>N</inf> (27.2%) was the most important, followed by E (24.8%), and finally P (9.3%). The findings demonstrate that DIN deposition is regulated by precipitation mainly via anthropogenic N emissions, and this analysis provides decision-makers a novel view for N pollution abatement. ©2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Integration of wind farms and solar systems as the major IRESs have significantly boosted the level of uncertainty in operation of power systems. This paper proposes a comprehensive computational framework for quantification and integration of uncertainties in distributed power systems (DPSs) with IRESs. Different sources of uncertainties in DPSs such as electrical load, wind and solar power forecasts and generator outages are covered by the proposed framework. Load forecast uncertainty is assumed to follow a normal distribution. Wind and solar forecast are implemented by a list of prediction intervals (PIs) ranging from 5% to 95%. Their uncertainties are further represented as scenarios using a scenario generation method. Generator outage uncertainty is modeled as discrete scenarios. The integrated uncertainties are further incorporated into a stochastic security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem and a heuristic genetic algorithm is utilized to solve this stochastic SCUC problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, five deterministic and four stochastic case studies are implemented. Generation costs as well as different reserve strategies are discussed from the perspectives of system economics and reliability. Comparative results indicate that the planned generation costs and reserves are different from the realized ones. The stochastic models show better robustness than deterministic ones. Power systems run a higher level of risk during peak load hours. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Genetic algorithm; Prediction interval; Renewable energy; Scenario generation; Uncertainty integration; Unit commitment","Amjady, N., Keynia, F., Zareipour, H., Wind power prediction by a new forecast engine composed of modified hybrid neural network and enhanced particle swarm optimization (2011) IEEE Trans Sustain Energy, 2 (3), pp. 265-276;

To reduce this uncertainty, we here quantify two questions for the power system of Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland): First, when compared within the same high-resolution modeling framework, how much do different combinations of technologies differ in these three respects? Second, how strongly does the cost and availability of grid-scale storage affect overall system cost, and would it favor some technology combinations above others? We compare three main possible generation technologies: (1) renewables, (2) nuclear, and (3) fossil fuels (with/without carbon capture and storage). Our results show that across a wide range of these combinations, the overall costs remain similar, implying that different configurations are equally feasible both technically and economically. However, the most economically favorable scenarios are not necessarily favorable in terms of emissions or energy security. The availability of grid-scale storage in scenarios with little dispatchable generation can reduce overall levelized electricity cost by up to 50%, depending on storage capacity costs. The UK can rely on its domestic wind and solar PV generation at lower renewable shares, with levelized costs only rising more than 10% above the mean of 0.084 GBP/kWh for shares of 50% and below at a 70% share, which is 35% higher. However, for more than an 80% renewable generation share to be economically feasible, large-scale storage, significantly more power imports, or domestic dispatchable renewables like tidal range must be available. © 2015 The Authors.","Energy policy;

One technically feasible solution to this challenge is to integrate a battery energy storage system (BESS) with a wind farm. This highlights the importance of a BESS control strategy. In view of this, a stochastic model predictive control scheme is proposed in this paper. Based on the forecasted wind power distributions, the proposed scheme ensures the optimal operation of BESS in the presence of practical system constraints, thus bringing the wind-battery combined power output to the desired dispatch levels. The salient feature of the proposed scheme is that it takes into account the non-Gaussian wind power uncertainties. In this scheme, a probabilistic wind power forecasting model is employed as the prediction model, which quantifies the non-Gaussian uncertainties in wind power forecasts. Using chance constraints, the quantified uncertainties are incorporated into the controller design, thus forming a chance constrained stochastic programming problem. Using warping function, this problem is recast as a convex quadratic optimization problem, which is tractable both theoretically and practically. This way, the proposed control scheme handles the non-Gaussian uncertainties in wind power forecasts. The simulation results on actual data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The data used in the simulation are obtained in the real operation of a wind farm in China. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Battery energy storage; Power dispatch; Probabilistic wind power forecast; Stochastic model predictive control;

To maximize the power extraction from the wind, optimization techniques are used at the various module of a wind farm starting from wind farm design for siting, sizing, optimal placement and sizing of distributed generation (DG) sources, generation scheduling, tuning of PID controller, control of wind energy conversion system (WECS) etc. This paper mainly focuses on the optimization algorithms (mostly the swarm based) in relation to integration of the wind farm with the grid. The paper here gives a precise idea about different optimization techniques, their advantage and disadvantage with respect to a wind farm.

This paper presents the application of DTC space vector modulation (DTC-SVM) to two and three level voltage source inverter (VSI) to improve the energy efficiency of a variable speed wind energy conversion system. Three different topologies are proposed to control the torque and flux of a squirrel-cage induction generator (SCIG) driven by a variable speed wind turbine. The main objective of this study is to improve the quality of energy of the wind energy conversion system by reducing torque ripples in the SCIG. Simulation results have shown that the proposed DTC-SVPWM with two or three levels inverter produced improved transient responses and reference tracking performance of the voltage in the generator and grid sides as well as the DC link. The overall simulation models have been implemented using Simulink and SimPowerSystems toolboxes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Direct torque control (DTC); Induction generator; Maximum power point tracking (MPPT); Multilevel inverter; Space vector modulation (SVM); Wind energy","An, H., Ko, H., Kim, H., Kim, H., Kim, S., Jang, G., Modelling and voltage-control of variable-speed SCIG-based wind farm (2012) Renew Energy, 42, pp. 28-35; Kim, H.S., Lu, D.D.-C., Wind energy conversion system from electrical perspective- a survey (2010) Smart Grid Renew Energy, 1, pp. 119-131; Lindholm, M., Doubly fed drives for variable speed wind turbine: a 40 kW laboratory setup.'

Stamps (2000) proposed effect size thresholds that are adapted to evaluate judgments of scenic impact, effect on enjoyment and continued use of scenic resources affected by ten proposed wind energy project in the State of Maine, USA. Users of scenic resources were interviewed at 15 locations evaluating 20 viewpoints. Overall, respondents found that the scenic impacts were very large (Hedges g < 1.1), while the effect of the change on enjoyment was so small that it is difficult to distinguish (0.2 < g < 0.5), and respondents say that the change will have a trivial effect (g < 0.2) on their continued use of the scenic resource where they were surveyed. The implications of these results are discussed, including the congruence with permitting orders, the relative merits of using scenic impact or measures of impact acceptability in decision-making, problems of measuring cumulative scenic impacts, and issues concerning survey quality control. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Intercept survey; Landscape perception; Public acceptability; Visual impact assessment; Visual simulation; Wind energy development","(2010) Publication manual of the American Psychological Association, , APA, Washington, DC; Borenstein, M., Hedges, L.V., Higgins, J.P.T., Rothstein, H.R., (2009) Introduction to meta-analysis, , Wiley, New York; Brunson, M.W., Kruger, L.E., Tyler, C.B., Schroeder, S.A., (1996) Defining social acceptability in ecosystem management: A workshop proceedings (General technical report PNW-GTR-369), , U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, Portland, OR; Churchward, C., Palmer, J.F., Nassauer, J.I., Swanwick, C.A., (2013) Evaluation of methodologies for visual impact assessments (NCHRP report 741), , National Academy of Sciences, Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC; Cohen, J., (1988) Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences, , Psychology Press, New York; (2015) Computer software, version 2.2.064, , Biostat, Englewood, NJ; (2015) Computer software, version 6.1, , Data Desk Data Description, Ithaca, NY; (2014) About EDRA, , http://www.edra.org/content/about-edra; (2008) M.R.S.A.

The knowledge gap is addressed by applying the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) decision tool to investigate the economic feasibility and effects of selected energy policy schemes on wind-biogas hybrid energy production, by taking into consideration geographic location (Greenwood, Sydney, Caribou Point), and wind turbine capacity (including 20, 35, and 50kW). The biogas energy production component reflected a representative Nova Scotia, Canada dairy farm with 100 cows. Wind-biogas hybrid energy systems were generally not economically feasible without COMFIT scheme financial incentives. Locating the hybrid energy system one km away from a utility grid increased cost of energy produced by about $0.06 per kWh. Under current government COMFIT scheme with guaranteed energy prices, economic feasibility improved relative to a base scenario, with NPV per kWh increasing from -$0.51 to $0.83 for a system with the 50kW turbine at Caribou Point, compared with -$0.51 to -$0.14 for a similar 50kW turbine at Sydney.

The technique uses the second-order structure function and Kolmogorov's law for inertial subrange. This methodology was applied on both neutral and stable stratification wind tunnel data, where the frozen turbulence hypothesis was assumed. The experiments were made with Reynolds Number ranging from 103 up to 104. The results show difference between the neutral and stable cases, but this gap decreases with the mean wind speed. Furthermore, TKEDR evaluated was used to describe the inertial subrange in the longitudinal velocity spectrum with a good agreement with the experimental data. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Normalised storage capacities with respect to annual demand for six locations with winter-peaking demand profiles were lower for wind generation than for PV generation, with an average PV:wind storage ratio of 1.768:1. For two summer-peaking demand profiles, normalised storage capacities were lower for PV generation, with storage ratios of 0.613:1 and 0.455:1. When the sensitivity of storage was modelled for winter-peaking demand profiles, average storage ratios were reduced. Hybrid wind/PV systems had lower storage capacity requirements than for wind generation alone for two locations. Peak power for storage charging was generally greater with PV generation than with wind generation, and peak charging power increased for the hybrid systems. The results are compared with those for country-scale electricity systems, and measures for minimising storage capacity are discussed. It is proposed that modelling of storage capacity requirements should be included in the design process at the earliest possible stage, and that new policy settings may be required to facilitate a transition to energy storage in fully renewable electricity systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity; PV; Renewable; Storage; Wind","Dell, R.M., Rand, D.A.J., Energy storage - a key technology for global energy sustainability (2001) JPower Sources, 100 (1-2), pp. 2-17; Anderson, D., Leach, M., Harvesting and redistributing renewable energy: on the role of gas and electricity grids to overcome intermittency through the generation and storage of hydrogen (2004) Energy Policy, 32 (14), pp. 1603-1614; Caralis, G., Zervos, A., Analysis of the combined use of wind and pumped storage systems in autonomous Greek islands (2007) IET Renew Power Gener, 1 (1), pp. 49-60; Heide, D., von Bremen, L., Greiner, M., Hoffmann, C., Speckmann, M., Bofinger, S., Seasonal optimal mix of wind and solar power in a future, highly renewable Europe (2010) Renew Energy, 35 (11), pp. 2483-2489; Converse, A.O., Seasonal energy storage in a renewable energy system (2012) Proc Ieee, 100 (2), pp. 401-409; Becker, S., Frew, B.A., Andresen, G.B., Zeyer, T., Schramm, S., Greiner, M., Features of a fully renewable US electricity system: optimized mixes of wind and solar PV and transmission grid extensions (2014) Energy, 72, pp. 443-458; Bueno, C., Carta, J.A., Technical-economic analysis of wind-powered pumped hydrostorage systems.

Box 800, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","The use of kinetic energy, stored in the rotational masses of Variable Speed Wind Turbines (VSWT), for inertial support is well established. The idea is to employ the fast control response of the VSWT to inject additional power for the short duration following the disturbance. However, the variable speed operation of the VSWT poses a great challenge in successfully designing an appropriate control approach, applicable for wide operating ranges, capable of minimizing the effects of energy regain by the Wind Turbine (WT) after the support period. To address this issue, this paper proposes a modified inertia-emulation scheme, based on Step Over-Production (SOP) approach. Further, to enable optimum energy transfer and to handle the problem of variable Stored Kinetic Energy (SKE), the shaping parameters of the proposed scheme are optimized using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results show that the proposed approach can limit the fall of frequency while reducing post disturbances across the entire operating range of the WT. In addition, the quantitative analysis reveals that the proposed method can easily satisfy the stringent grid code requirements for the inertia emulation and provides a better alternative to the conventional inertia control architectures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Doubly fed induction generators;

The Wind Integration National Dataset (WIND) Toolkit described in this article fulfills these requirements as the largest and most complete grid integration data set publicly available to date. A meteorological data set, wind power production time series, and simulated forecasts created using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model run on a 2-km grid over the continental United States at a 5-min resolution is now publicly available for more than 126,000 land-based and offshore wind power production sites. State-of-the-art forecast accuracy was mimicked by reforecasting the years 2007-2013 using industry-standard techniques.

But this does not warranty that the power converted by the whole wind farm be a maximum due to the interaction between turbines (wake effect). Unlike the conventional operation, this paper proposes the individual selection of the operation point of each turbine so that the overall production of the wind farm is maximized. To reach that goal, the power produced by some upwind turbines is slightly reduced in order to increase the available aerodynamic power for the downwind turbines, which results in an increase of the overall wind farm energy extraction. The optimization is performed by means of a genetic algorithm that selects the optimal pitch angle and tip speed ratio of each individual wind turbine, in order to maximize the overall wind farm production.As an important side effect, the proposed method, firstly intended to the maximization of the production of the wind power plant, also allows decreasing the added turbulence produced by wakes. As a consequence, the mechanical efforts acting on turbines are diminished and the overall wind farm availability (production) is increased. © 2015.","Genetic algorithm; Offshore wind farm; Wake effect; Wind energy; Wind farm; Wind farm operation","Krohn, S., Morthorst, P.E., Awerbuch, S., (2009) The economics of wind energy, pp. 28-29. , European Wind Energy Association; Barthelmie, R., Larsen, G., Frandsen, S., Folkerts, L., Rados, K., Pryor, S., Comparison of wake model simulations with offshore wind turbine wake profiles measured by sodar (2006) JAtmos Ocean Technol, 23 (7), pp. 888-901; Serrano González, J., González Rodríguez Á, G., Castro Mora, J., Burgos Payán, M., Santos, J.R., Overall design optimization of wind farms (2011) Renew Energy, 36, pp. 1973-1982; Serrano González, J., Burgos Payán, M., Riquelme Santos, J., Optimum design of transmissions systems for offshore wind farms including decision making under risk (2013) Renew Energy, 59, pp. 115-127; Steinbuch, M., de Boer, W., Bosgra, O., Peters, S., Ploeg, J., Optimal control of wind power plants (1988) JWind Eng Ind Aerodyn, 27, pp. 237-246; Corten, G., Schaak, P., Bot, E., More power and less loads in wind farms:'heat and flux' (2004) European wind energy conference & exhibition, London, UK; Larsen, G.C., Aagaard Madsen, H., Troldborg, N., Larsen, T.J., Réthoré, P.E., Fuglsang, P., (2011) TOPFARM - next generation design tool for optimisation of wind farm topology and operation; Madjidian, D., Rantzer, A., Astationary turbine interaction model for control of wind farms (2011) IFAC 18th world congress; Lee, J., Son, E., Hwang, B., Lee, S., Blade pitch angle control for aerodynamic performance optimization of a wind farm (2013) Renew Energy, 54, pp. 124-130; Marden, J.R., Shalom, D.R., Pao, L.Y., Amodel-free approach to wind farm control using game theoretic methods (2013) IEEE Trans Control Syst Technol, 21, pp. 1207-1214; Gebraad, P.M., van Dam, F.C., van Wingerden, J.W., Amodel-free distributed approach for wind plant control (2013) American control conference (ACC), 2013, pp. 628-633. , IEEE; Park, J., Kwon, S., Law, K.H., Wind farm power maximization based on a cooperative static game approach (2013) Proceedings of the SPIE active and passive smart structures and integrated systems conference, San Diego, CA, USA; Goit, J.P., Meyers, J., Analysis of turbulent flow properties and energy fluxes in optimally controlled wind-farm boundary layers (2014) The science of making torque from wind, Lyngby, Denmark; Frandsen, S., Barthelmie, R., Pryor, S., Rathmann, O., Larsen, S., Højstrup, J., Analytical modelling of wind speed deficit in large offshore wind farms (2006) Wind Energy, 9 (1-2), pp. 39-53; Katic, I., Høstrup, J., Jensen, N.O., Asimple model for cluster efficiency (1986) EWEC'86, Rome; Crespo, A., Hernández, J., Frandsen, S., Survey of modelling methods for wind turbine wakes and wind farms (1999) Wind Energy, 2, pp. 1-24; Grady, S.A., Hussaini, M., Abdullah, M.M., Placement of wind turbines using genetic algorithms (2005) Renew Energy, 30, pp. 259-270; Wan, C., Wang, J., Yang, G., Zhang, X., Optimal micro-siting of wind farms by particle swarm optimization (2010) Anonymous advances in swarm intelligence, pp. 198-205. , Springer; Saavedra-Moreno, B., Salcedo-Sanz, S., Paniagua-Tineo, A., Prieto, L., Portilla-Figueras, A., Seeding evolutionary algorithms with heuristics for optimal wind turbines positioning in wind farms (2011) Renew Energy, 36, pp. 2838-2844; Chowdhury, S., Zhang, J., Messac, A., Castillo, L., Unrestricted wind farm layout optimization (UWFLO): investigating key factors influencing the maximum power generation (2012) Renew Energy, 38, pp. 16-30; http://risoe.dtu.dk/WAsP.aspx, the Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program [online]http://www.emd.dk/WindPRO/, [online]http://www.meteodyn.com/en/wind%20energy.htmlJonkman, J.M., Butterfield, S., Musial, W., Scott, G., (2009) Definition of a 5-MW reference wind turbine for offshore system development, , National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Frandsen, S.T., (2007) Turbulence and turbulence-generated structural loading in wind turbine clusters, , Risø National Laboratory; Sørensen, J.D., Frandsen, S., Tarp-Johansen, N.J., Effective turbulence models and fatigue reliability in wind farms (2008) Prob Eng Mech, 23 (4), pp. 531-538; Spillman, R., Genetic algorithms, nature's way to search for the best (1993) Dr Dobb's J, pp. 26-30; Goldberg, D., (1989) Genetic algorithms in search, optimization and learning, , Addison-Wesley Pub.

The discontinuous and unforeseeable supply of energy is the main challenge inspiring this new proposal, which aims at reducing the environmental impact of electrolytic treatment by using a green energy supply. The results obtained using the coupled technologies are compared with those obtained by powering the electrolyser with a traditional power supply with a similar current intensity. The mineralisation of wastewater can be accomplished independently of how the electrolytic cell is powered, although differences in performance are clearly observed in the total organic carbon (TOC) and 2,4-D decays. These changes can be explained in terms of the changing profile of the current intensity, which influences the concentrations of the oxidants produced and thereby the mediated electrolytic process. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Boron-doped diamond anode; Electrolysis; Herbicide; Wind turbine","Brillas, E., Martínez-Huitle, C.A., (2011) Synthetic Diamond Films: Preparation, Electrochemistry, Characterization, and Applications; Bundschuh, J., Litter, M., Ciminelli, V.S.T., Morgada, M.E., Cornejo, L., Hoyos, S.G., Hoinkis, J., Bhattacharya, P., Emerging mitigation needs and sustainable options for solving the arsenic problems of rural and isolated urban areas in Latin America - a critical analysis (2010) Water Res., 44, pp. 5828-5845; Canizares, P., Saez, C., Sanchez-Carretero, A., Rodrigo, M.A., Synthesis of novel oxidants by electrochemical technology (2009) J.Appl.

The coordination of wind power with hydro units is an effective way for GENCOs to enhance the ability of wind power dispatch, increase profit, and reduce risk. However, GENCOs still need to prepare a certain amount of economic capital to cover the possible losses and keep them operating even in a worst-case scenario. In this paper, bidding strategies' value at risk is adopted to determine the economic capital requirement, and the risk adjusted return on capital (RAROC) which represents the return of economic capital is introduced. Then, this paper proposes a coordination bidding strategy for wind farms and hydro stations in a GENCO based on RAROC optimization. RAROC can measure the performance of risk management and estimate the tradeoff between profit and risk. Compared to the risk-neutral strategies, the proposed method prevents the GENCO from huge losses by risk management. Compared to the traditional risk-averse strategies, the proposed method does not need to quantify the GENCO's risk aversion and it is helpful for economic capital determination. Numerical example illustrates the proposed bidding strategy, as well as the comparison analysis and sensitivity analysis. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bidding strategy; Hourly coordination; Hydro power; Price-based unit commitment;

Realistic wind forecasts of different specified accuracy levels are created using an auto-regressive moving average model and these are then used in the creation of day-ahead unit commitment schedules. The schedules are generated for a model of the 2020 Irish electricity system with 33% wind penetration using both stochastic and deterministic approaches. Improvements in wind forecast accuracy are demonstrated to deliver: (i) clear savings in total system costs for deterministic and, to a lesser extent, stochastic scheduling; (ii) a decrease in the level of wind curtailment, with close agreement between stochastic and deterministic scheduling; and (iii) a decrease in the dispatch of open cycle gas turbine generation, evident with deterministic, and to a lesser extent, with stochastic scheduling. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Autoregressive moving average; Ireland; Power systems; Stochastic unit commitment; Wind curtailment; Wind forecasting","Kurbatsky, V., Tomin, N., Sidorov, D., Spiryaev, V., Application of two stages adaptive neural network approach for short-term forecast of electric power systems (2011) Environment and Electrical Engineering (EEEIC), 2011 10th International Conference on(Rome, Italy), pp. 1-4. , May (Rome, Italy); Foley, A.M., Leahy, P.G., Marvuglia, A., McKeogh, E.J., Current methods and advances in forecasting of wind power generation (2012) Renew Energy, 37 (1), pp. 1-8; (2010) National Renewable Energy Action Plan, , http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/NR/rdonlyres/C71495BB-DB3C-4FE9-A725-0C094FE19BCA/0/2010NREAP.pdf, Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; (2010) Northern Ireland Strategic Energy Framework, , http://www.detini.gov.uk/strategic_energy_framework__sef_2010_-3.pdf, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, UK; (2009) Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources; (2007) Trading & Settlement Code, Helicopter Guide, , tech. rep., Commission for Energy Regulation (Republic of Ireland) and Utility Regulator, Electrcity, Gas, Water (Northern Ireland); (2008) Wind generation in the SEM, policy for large-scale, intermittent non-diverse generation.

Most commonly, the focus of CMSP is on the siting of alternative uses across ocean space. This article examines the broader economic and distributional effects of the potential siting of a renewable energy facility (wind power) in a southern New England offshore area that also is used intensively for commercial fishing. For a leading siting alternative, a counterfactual involving the complete displacement of commercial fishing would result in estimated direct output impacts to the regional economy of $5 million, leading to $11 million in direct, indirect, and induced impacts and a corresponding loss of about 150 jobs. Total economic welfare losses were estimated at $14 million, reflecting not only output reductions but also the effects of price increases in the relevant markets. The welfare losses would be progressively distributed, such that households in mid- to high-income categories would likely bear the most significant impacts. Adjusting these welfare losses for society's aversion to income inequality, inequality-adjusted impacts would be more pronounced in areas that are not necessarily located in close proximity to the coastline. Individual low-income households located in five non-coastal census tracts would bear estimated median impacts (≥$140/year), which would be an order of magnitude larger than those borne by the next group of impacted households. When implementing CMSP, it is critically important to characterize not only the distribution of effects over the coastal ocean but also the distribution of impacts on coupled human communities onshore, including those communities that may not be considered strictly coastal. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Coastal and marine spatial planning (CMSP); Commercial fisheries; Computable general equilibrium (CGE); Ecosystem-based management (EBM); Inequality aversion; Offshore wind power","Crowder, L.B., Osherenko, G., Young, O.R., Airamé, S., Resolving mismatches in ocean governance (2006) Science, 313, pp. 617-618; Ehler, C., Douvere, F., (2009) Marine spatial planning: a step-by-step approach toward ecosystem-based management.

Because design guidelines do not currently recommend methods for determining foundation damping, it is typically neglected. This paper investigates the significance of foundation damping on monopile-supported OWTs subjected to extreme storm loading using a linear elastic two-dimensional finite element model. The effect of foundation damping primarily on the first natural frequency of the OWT was considered as OWT behavior is dominated by the first mode under storm loading. A simplified foundation model based on the soil-pile mudline stiffness matrix was used to represent the monopile, hydrodynamic effects were modeled via added hydrodynamic mass, and 1.00% Rayleigh structural damping was assumed. Hysteretic energy loss in the foundation was converted into a viscous, rotational dashpot at the mudline to represent foundation damping. Using the logarithmic decrement method on a finite element free vibration time history, 0.17%-0.28% of critical damping was attributed to foundation damping. Stochastic time history analysis of extreme storm conditions indicated that mudline OWT foundation damping decreases the maximum and standard deviation of mudline moment by 7-9%. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Damping; Monopile; Offshore wind turbine; Soil-structure interaction","Musial, W., Ram, B., (2010) Large-scale offshore wind power in the United States: assessment of opportunities and barriers, , Golden, CO; Seidel, M., (2014) Substructures for offshore wind turbines current trends and developments; Versteijlen, W., Metrikine, A., Hoving, J., Smid, E., de Vries, W., Estimation of the vibration decrement of an offshore wind turbine support structure caused by its interaction with soil (2011) EWEA offshore conference; Salzmann, D.J., van der Tempel, J., Aerodynamic damping in the design of support structures for offshore wind turbines (2005) Paper of the Copenhagen offshore conference; Valamanesh, V., Myers, A., Aerodynamic damping and seismic response of horizontal axis wind turbine towers (2014) JStruct Eng, 140, p. 11; Tarp-Johansen, N.J., Andersen, L., Christensen, E., Mørch, C., Kallesøe, B., Frandsen, S., Comparing sources of damping of cross-wind motion (2009) European offshore wind 2009: conference & exhibition, , 14-16 September; Shirzadeh, R., Devriendt, C., Bidakhvidi, M.A., Guillaume, P., Experimental and computational damping estimation of an offshore wind turbine on a monopile foundation (2013) JWind Eng Ind Aerodyn, 120, pp. 96-106; (2005) Overall damping for piled offshore support structures, guideline for the certification of offshore wind turbines, , Germanischer Lloyd WindEnergie; (2009) Design requirements for offshore wind turbines, , Brussels; (2013) DNV-OS-J101 design of offshore wind turbine structures, , Det Norske Veritas AS; Damgaard, M., Andersen, J., Ibsen, L.B., Andersen, L., Time-varying dynamic properties of offshore wind turbines evaluated by modal testing (2013) Proceedings of the 18th international conference on soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering, pp. 2343-2346; Petersen, B., Pollack, M., Connell, B., Greeley, D., Davis, D., Slavik, C., (2010) Evaluate the effect of turbine period of vibrations requirements on structural design parameters, , Groton, CT; Lombardi, D., Bhattacharya, S., Muir Wood, D., Dynamic soil-structure interaction of monopile supported wind turbines in cohesive soil (2013) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 49, pp. 165-180; Damgaard, M., Andersen, J., Ibsen, L.B., Andersen, L., Natural frequency and damping estimation of an offshore wind turbine structure (2012) Proceedings of the twenty-second international offshore and polar engineering conference, 4, pp. 300-307; Jonkman, J., Butterfield, S., Musial, W., Scott, G., (2009) Definition of a 5-MW reference wind turbine for offshore system development definition of a 5-MW reference wind turbine for offshore system development; (2014), ADINA R&D, Inc., Watertown, MAHansteen, O.E., Höeg, K., Soil-structure interaction analysis of embedded caisson anchor under tension load (1994) BOSS'94, 7th international conference on the behavior of offshore structures, pp. 49-62; (1991) Description of INFIDEL - a non-linear, 3-D finite element program; Bush, E., Manuel, L., Foundation models for offshore wind turbines (2009) 47th AIAA aerospace sciences meeting including the new horizons forum and aerospace exposition, , no.

The system consists of individual three-tab shingles that are discretely bonded to the underlying shingles and subjected to differential out-of-plane pressures that are associated with high wind loads. Relevant mechanical properties for a typical modern asphalt shingle and sealant were determined experimentally and input in the proposed structural model. The model was then used to estimate the applied energy release rate, G, for the sealant strip as a function of length, location, and applied uplift pressures on the shingle. Results indicate that the G values are highly sensitive to sealant strip location and length, and that the sealant strip location in typical modern shingles is roughly optimized to ensure a balanced value of G at the inner and outer sealant strip edges. However, predictions also indicate that G could be further reduced by using longer sealant strips that are slightly shifted towards the leading edge of the shingle, thereby decreasing the potential for failure. Additional BOEF model simulations were performed using full-field shingle uplift displacements as input to determine the potential for estimating the average uplift pressures imparted on asphalt shingles under high wind loading conditions. Promising results were obtained regarding the suitability of the proposed BOEF-based inverse analysis technique to estimate shingle uplift pressures. In addition, G values that are scaled for high pressures associated with extreme wind conditions, and resulting in sealant separation, are in qualitative agreement with an estimate of critical energy release rate, G<inf>c</inf>, based on the results of standard direct tensile tests reported in the literature. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Asphalt shingles; Digital image correlation; Energy release rate; High wind-induced uplift pressure loading; Measured elastic properties; Numerical simulations; Roof structures; Structural analysis","Dixon, C., Masters, F., Prevatt, D., Gurley, K., An historical perspective on the wind resistance of asphalt shingles (2012) Interface, pp. 4-14; Peterka, J.A., Cermak, J.E., Cochran, L.S., Cochran, B.C., Hosoya, N., Derickson, R.G., Wind uplift model for asphalt shingles (1997) J Archit Eng, 3 (4), pp. 147-155; Peterka, J.A., Cermak, J.E., Cochran, L., Cochran, B., Hosoya, N., Derickson, R.G., Closure to ""Wind uplift model for asphalt shingles"" (1999) J Archit Eng, 5 (2), pp. 68-69; Standard test method for wind resistance of asphalt shingles (uplift force/uplift resistance method) (2011), ASTM D7158.

However, wind energy is intermittent and uncertain. This uncertainty poses a techno-economic challenge of sourcing the least costing load balancing service (reserve). This paper looks to develop solutions for this challenge.Currently the system unbalance caused by the wind power is handled by the real time balancing market, which is operated by the system operators for maintaining reliable operation of power systems. This method cannot always work reliably when the amount of wind penetration increases in the future. A future electricity market, with no subsidies, is assumed in this paper where wind generators have to compete with other generators to sell energy. It is assumed that wind generators are competitively scheduled a day-ahead and would suffer penalties for under production while receiving a poor compensation for over production. To overcome the uncertainty in wind production, an options based network constrained intra-day secondary reserve market is proposed in this research with a mathematical formulation that considers purchasing energy from several reserve providers. Reserves may be purchased by procuring options ahead of transactions by paying premiums and paying strike prices while transacting. The market equilibrium amongst participants will be reached with proposed optimization and the lambda (LaGrange) multiplier associated with power balance equation at each bus determines optimal values of both premiums and strike prices. The amount of required reserve is calculated by using a Cauchy-Lorentz distribution model. The reserves are positive for under production and negative for over production. Transmission network MVA limits are considered to ensure feasibility of options contracts. A 5-bus test system and a real Ontario (Canada) wind farm data with IEEE 118-bus system illustrate the merits of this research. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Financial options; Forecast error; Reserve procurement","Wiser, R., Bolinger, M., (2013) 2012 Wind technologies market report, , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Conejo, A.J., Carrion, M., Morales, J.M., Decision making under uncertainty in electricity markets (2010) International series in operations research and management science; Pflug, G.C., Broussev, N., Electricity swing options: behavioural models and pricing (2009) Eur J Oper Res, 197, pp. 1041-1050; Hjalmarsson, E., (2003) Does the Black-Scholes formula work for electricity markets?A nonparametric approach, , Working Papers in Economics no 101; Rashidinejad, M., Song, Y.H., Javidi, M.H., Option pricing of spinning reserve in a deregulated electricity market (2000) Symposium on nuclear power systems, 18-19 October, Lyon, France; Ghaffari, R., Venkatesh, B., Options based reserve procurement strategy for wind generators- using binomial trees (2013) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 28, pp. 1063-1072; Wang, J.H., Shahidehpour, M., Li, Z.Y., Security-constrained unit commitment withvolatile wind power generation (2008) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 23 (3), pp. 1319-1327; Ortega-Vazquez, M., Kirschen, D., Estimating spinning reserve requirements in systems with significantwind power generation penetration (2009) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 24 (1), pp. 114-124; Doherty, R., O'Malley, M., Anew approach to quantify reserve demand in systems with significant installed wind capacity (2005) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 20 (2), pp. 587-595; Dietrich, K., Stochastic unit commitment considering uncertain wind production in an isolated system (2009) 4th Conference on energy economics and technology, Dresden, Germany; Bludzuweit, H., Statistical analysis of wind power forecast error (2008) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 23, pp. 983-991; Coughlin, K., Eto, J.H., (2010) Analysis of wind power and load data at multiple time scales, , Environmental Energy Technologies Division; Hodge, B.-M., Florita, A., Orwig, K., Lew, D., Milligan, M., Acomparison of wind power and load forecasting error distributions (2012) World renewable energy Forum Denver, Colorado; Hodge, B.-M., Milligan, M., Wind power forecasting error distributions over multiple timescales (2011) IEEE Power & Energy Society general Meeting, , Detroit, Michigan; http://www.ieso.ca/imoweb/marketdata/marketData.asp, [Online]http://www.ieso.ca/map/index.html, [Online]Hull, J.C., (2002) Fundamentals of futures and option markets, p. 237. , Prentice Hall, New Jersey; Cox, J., Ross, S., Rubinstein, M., Option pricing: a simplified approach (1979) Financ Econ, 7, pp. 229-263; Rubinstein, M., Implied binomial trees (1994) Finance, , [Presidential Address to the American Finance Association]; Rendleman, R.J., Bratter, B.J., Two-state option pricing (1979) Finance, 24, pp. 1093-1110; Liu, S., Trinomial tree option pricing via threshold-Garch model (2011) Res Rev Appl Sci; Black, F., Scholes, M., The pricing of options and corporate liabilities (1973) Polit Econ, 81 (3), pp. 637-654; Lane, D.W., Modeling and evaluating electricity options markets with intelligent agents (2000) International Conference on Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and power Technologies, , Proceedings.

The objective of present study is to predict wind speeds for 11 locations in the Western Himalayan Indian state of Himachal Pradesh to identify possible wind energy applications. An artificial neural network (ANN) model is used to predict wind speeds using measured wind data of Hamirpur location for training and testing. Temperature, air pressure, solar radiation and altitude are taken as inputs for the ANN model to predict daily mean wind speeds. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and correlation coefficient between the predicted and measured wind speeds are found to be 4.55% and 0.98 respectively. Predicted wind speeds are found to range from 1.27 to 3.78m/s for Bilaspur, Chamba, Kangra, Kinnaur, Kullu, Keylong, Mandi, Shimla, Sirmaur, Solan and Una locations. A micro-wind turbine is used to assess the wind power generated at these locations which is found to vary from 773.61W to 5329.76W which is suitable for small lighting applications. Model is validated by predicting wind speeds for Gurgaon city for which measured data are available with MAPE 6.489% and correlation coefficient 0.99 showing high prediction accuracy of the developed ANN Model. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Artificial neural network; India; Power generation; Western Himalayas; Wind speed prediction","Şahin, A.D., Progress and recent trends in wind energy (2004) Prog Energy Combust Sci, 30, pp. 501-543; http://www.wwindea.org/home/index.php, [accessed 05.09.14]Onea, F., Rusu, E., An evaluation of the wind energy in the North-West of the Black Sea (2014) Int J Green Energy, 11, pp. 465-487; http://www.ren21.net/, [accessed 17.09.14]http://www.cwet.tn.nic.in/, [accessed 17.09.14]Krishnadas, G., Ramachandra, T.V., Scope for renewable energy in Himachal Pradesh, India - a study of solar and wind resource potential.

A continuously linearized MPC approach is described and applied to control a 3-bladed, horizontal axis, variable speed wind turbine. The tuning involves a multiobjective cost function so that the performance can be optimized with respect to five defined measures: power variation, pitch usage, tower displacement, drivetrain twist and frequency of violating the nominal power limit.

The alternative energy related literature had attracted a growing attention with the research outputs expanding substantially. Based on the Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E) and the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), a bibliometric analysis of the research output was carried out to depict existing research activities on alternative energy and future directions. The article was the main type of publications with the English as the dominate language to explain their results. With the publications increasing rapidly since 2008, the researches mostly focused on the fields of Energy & Fuels and Environmental Sciences. Energy Policy was the journal that published the largest number of research articles on the alternative energy. The bioenergy and solar energy were popular items in the commonly used 20 journals. Among the countries, the USA was leading on alternative energy related research, publishing the largest number of articles (TP=2368) and being the most influent (h-index=90). The USA played a key role in the academic collaborations with China, UK, Canada, Germany, Italy, South Korea and Spain. The National Renewable Energy Lab (the USA) contributed most in the alternative energy field and more specially, the School of Electrical & Computer Engineering (TP=36) was the most productive subordinate in the National Technology University of Athens. It was interesting to note that more attention was paid to solar or wind energy during the first 5 or 10 years, then turned to bioenergy subsequently except for Spain, Canada and Australia. In addition, bioenergy received the most attention in the 7 types of alternative energy. The forest/wood biomass, energy crops and switchgrass were the main bioenergy resources and fermentation was the commonly used conversion technology. The production of biogas, biodiesel and bioethanol was most popular in the bioenergy related studies. Wind energy and solar energy related researches were mainly on the energy utilization approaches such as the wind generation, wind farm, photovoltaic and solar thermal. The conversion devices such as the wind turbine and solar cell were paid most attention in order to improve the production efficiency. The most cited article, published in Desalination in 2009 with 1562 citations until 2013, was about wind power utilization in the reverse osmosis desalination plant. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In a wind farm, the energy production of the downstream wind turbines decreases due to reduced wind speed and increased level of turbulence caused by the wakes formed by the upstream wind turbines. As a result, the wake interference among wind turbines lower the overall power efficiency of the wind farm. To improve the overall efficiency of a wind farm, researchers have studied the wind farm layout optimization problem to find the placement locations of wind turbines that maximize the expected wind farm power. Most studies on wind farm layout optimization employ heuristic search-based optimization algorithms. In spite of their simplicity, optimization algorithms based on heuristic search are computationally expensive and have limitation in optimizing the locations of a large number of wind turbines since the computational time for the search tends to increase exponentially with increasing number of wind turbines. This study employs a mathematical optimization scheme to efficiently and effectively optimize the locations of a large number of wind turbines with respect to maximizing the wind farm power production. To formulate the mathematical optimization problem, we derive a continuous wake model and express the expected wind farm power as a continuous and smooth function in terms of the locations of the wind turbines.

Commercial fishing has been identified by many as the industry most likely to be affected by the development of MRE. In order to reduce the risk of spatial conflict and to enable decision-making based on the co-existence of the two sectors, it is important to gain a better understanding of the attitudes of fishermen towards the development of MRE projects in their locality. A survey was designed to provide quantitative information on fishermen's attitudes to marine renewable energy and the perceived impacts and opportunities. Three MRE developments which have been proposed around the island of Ireland (comprising Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland) were chosen as case study sites in which to carry out the survey. The sites represent offshore wind, wave and tidal energy respectively and are in differing stages of development. In total, 104 complete surveys were conducted with fishermen located at ports in the vicinity of the case study sites. 40% of those surveyed agreed that it is important to develop marine renewable energy in their locality. A further 15% were neutral on this matter. It is encouraging for developers and policy makers that the majority of respondents (70%) were of the opinion that fisheries and MRE projects can co-exist. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Attitudes; Co-existence; Fishermen; Marine renewable energy; Perceptions","Jay, S., Planners to the rescue: spatial planning facilitating the development of offshore wind energy (2009) Mar Pollut Bull, 60 (4), pp. 493-499; Ladenburg, J., Attitudes towards on-land and offshore wind power development in Denmark; choice of development strategy (2008) Renew Energy, 33 (1), pp. 111-118; Farrier, D., Wind energy in the coastal environment - prospects for a nearshore wind farm off East Anglia (1997) Marine environmental management review of 1996 and future trends, 4, pp. 85-88; Ladenburg, J., Möller, B., Attitude and acceptance of offshore wind farms (2011) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 15 (9), pp. 4223-4235; Soderholm, P., Ek, K., Pettersson, M., Wind power development in Sweden: global policies and local obstacles (2007) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 11 (3), pp. 365-400; Tong, K.C., Technical and economic aspects of a floating offshore wind farm (1998) J Wind Eng Ind Aerodyn, pp. 399-410; Still, D., Offshore wind at Blyth (2001) Renew Energy, 24 (3-4), pp. 545-551; White, C., Halpern, B.S., Kappel, C.V., Ecosystem service tradeoff analysis reveals the value of marine spatial planning for multiple ocean uses (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 109 (12), pp. 4696-4701; Alexander, K.A., Wilding, T.A., Heymans, J.J., Attitudes of Scottish fishers towards marine renewable energy (2013) Mar Policy, 37, pp. 239-244; Gray, T., Haggett, C., Bell, D., Offshore wind farms and commercial fisheries in the UK: a study in Stakeholder Consultation (2005) Ethics Place Environ, 8 (2), pp. 127-140; Rodmell, D.P., Johnson, M.L., The development of marine based wind energy generation and inshore fisheries in UK waters: are they compatible?

To that end, weather variable predictions of various horizons are particularly useful, as major components of the energy system depend directly or indirectly on prevalent weather conditions. Instead of obtaining weather prediction inputs from an external entity, such as a meteorological office this work proposes the use of a hybrid model that is able to generate localised predictions for ambient temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. A weighted regression and an autoregressive process were implemented in order to develop two hybrid models. The models produce forecasts in a horizon of six hours ahead, with an hourly temporal resolution and are based on two components. The persistence component assumes stationarity of the conditions in the atmosphere, while the numerical component downscales synoptic scale weather observations to a localised region. In this study the persistence will be used as both the reference model to determine the skill of the numerical and the hybrid models, as well as an input component with decreasing weighting for the hybrid models. The hybrid models show notable improvements in skill over both individual components up to 38% for temperature, 28% for relative humidity and 9% for wind speed respectively. More frequent update of reference component inputs, improved the accuracy of the hybrid models even further. Specifically, when the update intervals of the reference component occurred twice as often, the predictions improved by up to 50% compared to the original models. Furthermore, the hybrid models were adjusted to develop forecasts useful for building energy system management, such as the occurrence of a sudden change or a peak temperature. This novel approach is relatively simple to implement and unlike previous works, focuses on high spatial resolution regions and metrics tailored to the optimisation framework of energy management of buildings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Building energy management;

The wake produced by the rotors interacts with downstream turbines, resulting in a reduction in power output. In this paper, we demonstrate a new and faster modelling technique which combines actuator disc theory, modelled using wind tunnel validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and integrated into full rotor CFD simulations. This novel hybrid of techniques results in the ability to analyse performance when simulating various array layouts more rapidly and accurately than using either method on its own.It is shown that there is a significant power reduction from a downstream turbine that is subjected to the wake of an upstream turbine, and that this is due to both a reduction in power in the wind and also due to changes in the aerodynamics. Analysis of static pressure along the blade showed that as a result of wake interactions, a large reduction in the suction peak along the leading edge reduced the lift generated by the rotor and so reduced the torque production and the ability for the blade to extract energy from the wind. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Actuator disc; Computational fluid dynamics; Hybrid simulation technique; Wind tunnel test; Wind turbine array performance; Wind turbine wake interactions","Sturge, D., While, A., Howell, R., Engineering and energy yield: the missing dimension of wind turbine assessment (2014) Energy Policy, 65, pp. 245-250; Zoellner, J., Schweizer-Ries, P., Wemheuer, C., Public acceptance of renewable energies: results from case studies in Germany (2008) Energy Policy, 36, pp. 4136-4141; Cowell, R., Bristow, G., Munday, M., Acceptance, acceptability and environmental justice: the role of community benefits in wind energy development (2011) JEnviron Plan Manag, 54 (4), pp. 539-557; (2012) National planning policy framework; Betz, A., Das Maximum der theoretisch moglichen Ausnutzung des Windes durch Windmotoren (1920) Zfür Das gesamte Turbinenwes, (26), pp. 307-309; Vermeer, L.J., Sørensen, J.N., Crespo, A., Wind turbine wake aerodynamics (2003) Prog Aerosp Sci, 39, pp. 467-510; Sanderse, B., (2009) Aerodynamics of wind turbine wakes literature review, , Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands; Réthoré, P., Van Der Laan, P., Troldborg, N., Zahle, F., Sørensen, N.N., Verification and validation of an actuator disc model (2014) Wind Energy, 17 (6), pp. 919-937; España, G., Aubrun, S., Loyer, S., Devinant, P., Spatial study of the wake meandering using modelled wind turbines in a wind tunnel (2011) Wind Energy, 14, pp. 923-937; Weihing, P., Meister, K., Schulz, C., Lutz, T., Krämer, E., CFD simulations on Interference effects between Offshore wind turbines (2014) JPhys Conf Ser, 524, p. 012143; Malki, R., Masters, I., Williams, A.J., Nick Croft, T., Planning tidal stream turbine array layouts using a coupled blade element momentum - computational fluid dynamics model (2014) Renew Energy, 63, pp. 46-54; Ivanell, S., Sørensen, J.N., Mikkelsen, R., Henningson, D., Analysis of numerically generated wake structures (2009) Wind Energy, 12, pp. 63-80; Whale, J., Anderson, C., Bareiss, R., Wagner, S., An experimental and numerical study of the vortex structure in the wake of a wind turbine (2000) JWind Eng Ind Aerodyn, 84 (1), pp. 1-21; Danao, L.A.M., (2012) The influence of unsteady wind on the performance and aerodynamics of vertical axis wind turbines, , The University of Sheffield; (2009) ANSYS fluent 12.0 user's guide; Cabezón, D., Sanz, J., Marti, I., Crespo, A., CFD modelling of the interaction between the surface boundary layer and rotor wake.

This study brings new findings about the impact of two crucial factors: numbers of WTs (1-25) visible and distances of WTs (0.75-15. km) from the observer (e.g. from residential buildings, landmarks, observation points). Photographs of three aesthetically varying landscapes with various numbers of WTs (Vestas V90, height 105. m, rotor diameter 90. m) at various distances were evaluated in terms of visual preferences. The results show significant effect from the aesthetic value of a given landscape on the impact of both tested factors. An important finding is that the landscape with the highest aesthetic quality initially was evaluated to be the absolute worst after the addition of WTs and vice versa. Increasing numbers of WTs in the least attractive landscape had less visual impact than did doing so in the two more attractive landscapes. This helps explain strong public opposition to locating WTs in aesthetically valuable landscapes and their greater acceptance in less-attractive landscapes. Increasing stepwise from 1 to 25 WTs within a given landscape progressively decreased visual preferences, although the cumulative effect of a higher number of WTs was not confirmed. We also established threshold distances after which the negative visual impact of a WT disappeared (10. km for the most attractive landscape, 5. km for the least attractive one). Based on these findings, visibility zones were proposed for practical assessment of WTs' visual impact. The study's results can make a substantial contribution towards reducing negative visual impact in WT planning and thus achieving greater public acceptance of these devices. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Landscape quality; Renewable energy planning; Visual impact; Visual preference; Wind power","Drewitt, A.L., Langston, R.H.W., Assessing the impacts of wind farms on birds (2006) Ibis, 148, pp. 29-42; King, E.A., Pilla, F., Mahon, J., Assessing noise from wind farms developments in Ireland: a consideration of critical wind speeds and turbine choice (2012) Energy Policy, 41, pp. 548-560; Molnarova, K., Sklenicka, P., Stiborek, P., Svobodova, K., Salek, M., Brabec, E., Visual preferences for wind turbines: location, numbers and respondent characteristics (2012) Appl Energy, 92, pp. 269-278; Ladenburg, J., Termansen, M., Hasler, B., Assessing acceptability of two onshore wind power development schemes: a test of viewshed effects and the cumulative effects of wind turbines (2013) Energy, 54, pp. 45-54; Ladenburg, J., Visual impact assessment of offshore wind farms and prior experience (2009) Appl Energy, 86, pp. 380-387; Wolsink, M., Wind power and the NIMBY-myth: institutional capacity and the limited significance of public support (2000) Renewable Energy, 21, pp. 49-64; Bell, D., Gray, T., Haggett, C., The, ""social gap"" in wind farm siting decisions: explanations and policy responses (2005) Environ Polit, 14, pp. 460-477; Devine-Wright, P., Local aspects of UK renewable energy development: exploring public beliefs and policy implications (2005) Local Environ, 10, pp. 57-69; Ek, K., Public and private attitudes towards ""green"" electricity: the case of Swedish wind power (2005) Energy Policy, 33, pp. 1677-1689; Petrova, M.A., NIMBYism revisited: public acceptance of wind energy in the United States (2013) Wiley Interdisciplinary Rev Clim Change, 4, pp. 575-601; Zoellner, J., Schweizer-Ries, P., Wemheuer, C., Public acceptance of renewable energies: results of case studies from Germany (2008) Energy Policy, 36, pp. 4136-4141; Swofford, J., Slattery, M., Public attitudes of wind energy in Texas: local communities in close proximity to wind farms and their effect on decision-making (2010) Energy Policy, 38, pp. 2508-2519; Meyerhoff, J., Do turbines in the vicinity of respondentś residences influence choices among programmes for future wind power generation?

However, their use impacts the environment and the current rate at which they are being put into operation, combined with understanding of their medium-and long-term impact, is a cause of concern. Wind farms represent a new source of impact and disturbance for birds adds to the long list of disturbance factors caused by human activity, such as power lines, radio, television and cell phone towers, highways, glass windows or the practice of fishing and illegal hunting. Due to the precarious situation of several bird species and their decline, any additional cause of mortality may be significant and should give rise to increased attention and analysis. The aim of the present work is to analyse the impact of wind turbines located in five selected optimal sites for the installation of wind farms on birds in Lebanon. The results suggest that the presence of the wind turbines will not have a clearly negative effect on birds in the sites where wind farms could be installed. Some sites are closed to natural reserves such as Cedars and Quaraoun or near roads used by migratory birds such as Marjyoun, Klaiaat Quaraoun, but the impacts can be reduced by taking preventive measures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bird conservation; Birds of prey; Collision risk; IBA birdlife; Migration; Wind turbines","(2008), SPNL)-, A.

To secure power system operation wind turbines have to meet grid requirements through the Low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability and contribute to grid voltage control during severe situations. This paper presents the modeling and control designs for WECS based on a real model of DFIG taking into account the effect of stator resistance. The non-linear control technique using sliding mode control (SMC) strategy is used to alter the dynamics of 1.5MW wind turbine system connected to the grid under severe faults of grid voltage. The paper, also discusses the transient behavior and points out the performance limit for LVRT by using two protection circuits of an AC-crowbar and a DC-Chopper which follow a developed flowchart of system protection modes under fault which achieved LVRT requirements through results. The model has been implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK for both rotor and grid side converters. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Active AC-crowbar; DC-chopper; Doubly fed induction generator; Low voltage ride through; Sliding mode control","Pena, R., Clare, J.C., Asher, G.M., Doubly fed induction generator using back-to-back PWM converters and its application to variable speed wind energy generation (1996) IEE Proc Electr Power Appl, 143 (3), pp. 231-241. , May; Ekanayake, J.B., Holds Worth, L., Wu, X.G., Jenkins, N., Dynamic modeling of doubly fed induction generator wind turbines (2003) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 18 (2), pp. 803-809. , May; Qiao, W., Dynamic modeling and control of doubly fed induction generator driven by wind turbines (2009) IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition, pp. 1-8. , PSCE'09; Jou, S.-T., Lee, S.-B., Park, Y.-B., Lee, K.-B., Direct power control of a DFIG in wind turbines to improve dynamic responses (2009) JPE, 9 (5), pp. 781-790. , September; Lopez, J., Sanchis, P., Roboam, X., Marroyo, L., Dynamic behavior of the doubly fed induction generator during three-phase voltage dips (2007) Energy Convers IEEE Trans, 22 (3), pp. 709-717; Seman, S., Niiranen, J., Arkkio, A., Ride-through analysis of doubly fed induction wind power generator under unsymmetrical network disturbance (2006) Power Syst IEEE Trans, 21 (4), pp. 1782-1789; http://www.slideshare.net/rcreee/boo-wind-power-in-egypt, May 12, 2013Lee, S.-H., Joo, Y., Back, J., Seo, J.-H., Choy, I., Sliding mode controller for torque and pitch control of PMSG wind power systems (2011) JPower Electron, 11 (3), pp. 342-349. , May; Bekakra, Y., Attous, D., (2011) Active and reactive power control of a DFIG with MPPT for variable speed wind energy conversion using sliding mode control, pp. 1543-1549. , World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology; Belgacem, K., Mezouar, A., Massoum, A., Sliding mode control of doubly fed induction generator for wind energy conversion (2013) Int J Energy Eng, 3 (1), pp. 30-36; Morren, J., de Haan, S.W.H., Ride through of wind turbines with doubly-fed induction generator during a voltage dip (2005) IEEE Trans Energy Convers, 20 (2), pp. 435-441. , June; Erlich, I., Wrede, H., Feltes, C., Dynamic behavior of DFIG-based wind turbines during grid faults (2007) IEEE, pp. 1195-1200; Zhou, Y., Student Member, IEEE, Bauer, P., Senior Member, IEEE, Ferreira, J.A., Fellow, IEEE, Operation of grid-connected DFIG under unbalanced grid voltage condition (2009) IEEE Trans Energy Convers, 24 (1), pp. 240-246. , March; Wessels, C., Student Member, IEEE, Fuchs, F.W., Senior Member, IEEE, Fault ride through of DFIG wind turbines during symmetrical voltage dip with crowbar or stator current feedback solution (2010) IEEE, 12, pp. 2771-2777. , Sept; Zhang, X., Pan, W., Liu, Y., Xu, D., Improved grid voltage control strategy for wind farms with DFIGs connected to distribution networks (2012) JPE, 12 (3), pp. 495-502. , May",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924626444

It is estimated that only 40% of Nigerians are connected to the national grid and the connected population are exposed to frequent power outages. Nigeria's electricity grid is mainly powered by large hydropower and depleting hydrocarbon resources. Fossil-based electricity generation contributes not only to increase in carbon footprints, but also exposes the country to changes in price of petroleum resources and political instability from the oil producing region of the country. The country is blessed with abundant Renewable Energy (RE) resources that have not been fully exploited; these renewable resources have the potentials to change the status quo of power generation and consumption in the country. Availability of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) in all parts of Nigeria has been demonstrated in several studies. However, there is presently no comprehensive review of RE development in Nigeria. This contribution aims to fill this gap by focusing on the current status and future prospects of RE in Nigeria as well as identifying the key challenges confronting full scale RE development in the country. We discussed the existing government policies and legislations, and proposed others that can help speed up the adoption of RE in Nigeria. We also compared RE development in Nigeria with four other sub-Sahara African countries. We hope that this paper will stimulate further research on how to address the energy crisis in Nigeria using the RESs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The world is transforming itself into an industrial and knowledge society from an agricultural one which in turn makes the growth, energy intensive resulting in emissions. Energy modeling and energy planning is vital for the future economic prosperity and environmental security. Soft computing techniques such as fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithms are being adopted in energy modeling to precisely map the energy systems. In this paper, an attempt has been made to review the applications of fuzzy logic based models in renewable energy systems namely solar, wind, bio-energy, micro-grid and hybrid applications. It is found that fuzzy based models are extensively used in recent years for site assessment, for installing of photovoltaic/wind farms, power point tracking in solar photovoltaic/wind, optimization among conflicting criteria. The review indicates that fuzzy based models provide realistic estimates. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study uses Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to compare the environmental impacts of a diesel/PV/wind hybrid microgrid on the island of Koh Jig, Thailand with the electrification alternatives of grid extension and home diesel generators. The impact categories evaluated are: acidification potential (kg SO2 eq), global warming potential (kg CO2 eq), human toxicity potential (kg 1.4 DCB eq), and abiotic resource depletion potential (kg Sb eq). The results show that the microgrid system has the lowest global warming and abiotic resource depletion potentials of all three electrification scenarios. The use phase of the diesel generator and the extraction of copper are shown to significantly contribute to the microgrid's environmental impacts. The relative environmental impacts of the grid extension scenario are found to be proportional to the distance required for grid extension. Across all categories except acidification potential, the impacts from the home diesel generators are the largest. Sensitivity analyses show that maximizing the renewable energy fraction does not necessarily produce a more environmentally sustainable electrification scenario and that the diesel generator provides versatility to the system by allowing power production to be scaled significantly before more technology is needed to meet demand. While the environmental benefits of the microgrid increase as the installation community becomes more isolated, the choice of electrification scenario requires assigning relative importance to each impact category and considering social and economic factors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","ADP; AP; CML-IA; Diesel electricity generation; GWP; HTP; Hybrid microgrid system; KMUTT; Life Cycle Assessment; Power grid extension; Renewable energy; Rural electrification development","Cook, P., Infrastructure, rural electrification and development (2011) Energy Sustain Dev, 15 (3), pp. 304-313; Mahapatra, S., Dasappa, S., Rural electrification: optimising the choice between decentralised renewable energy sources and grid extension (2012) Energy Sustain Dev, pp. 146-154; Chaurey, A., Kandpal, T.C., Assessment and evaluation of PV based decentralized rural electrification: an overview (2010) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 14 (8), pp. 2266-2278; Bala, B.K., Siddique, S., Optimal design of a PV-diesel hybrid system for electrification of an isolated island- Sandwip in Bangladesh using genetic algorithm (2009) Energy Sustain Dev, pp. 137-142; del Rio, P., Burguillo, M., An empirical analysis of renewable energy deployment on local sustainability (2009) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 13, pp. 1314-1325; Green, D., Thailand's solar white elephants: an analysis of 15 yr of solar battery charging programmes in Northern Thailand (2004) Energy Policy, 32, pp. 747-760; Greacen, C., Prasitpianchai, S., Suwannakum, T., Menke, C., (2007) Renewable energy options on islands in the Andaman Sea, , King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Report; (2011) World energy outlook 2011, , International Energy Agency, Report; Phuangpornpitak, N., Kumar, S., User acceptance of Diesel/PV hybrid system in an island community (2011) Renew Energy, 36 (1), pp. 125-131; Mini-grid system for rural electrification in the greater Mekong sub regional countries., , University of Kassel, [Thesis, Unpublished Results]; Mini-grid of renewable energy hybrid system for rural village (case study: Ko Chik village) Energy Policy and Planning Office, , [Unpublished Results]; Jorge, R.S., Hawkins, T.R., Hertwich, E.G., Life cycle assessment of electricity transmission and distribution - part 1: power lines and cables (2011) Int J Life Cycle Assess, 17, pp. 9-15; Hoffman, U., Requirements for environmentally sound and economically viable management of lead as important natural resource and hazardous waste in the wake of trade restrictions on secondary lead by decision iii/1 of the basel convention: the case of used batteries in the Phillippines (1999) United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, , [Unpublished Results]; (2006) ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, environmental management - Life cycle assessment; Wilson, F.G., (2013) Gas and diesel generators, , http://www.fgwilson.com/, Company Website; (2013), http://fortiswindenergy.com/, Company WebsiteFthenakis, V.M., Kim, H.C., Photovoltaics: life-cycle analyses (2011) Sol Energy, 85, pp. 1609-1628; (2013), http://www.prometheusinstitute.org/admin/researchnotes/uploads/PV2-0301.09_-Shell_Solar-.pdf, Prometheus Institute for Sustainable Development(2011) Wet lead acid storage batteries, , http://www.batteryenergy.com.au//content_common/pg-downloads.seo, Battery Energy Power Solutions Pty Ltd, Fairfield NSW.

The model was forced by Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) winds and ETOPO2 bathymetry data. The highest annual wave power can be found in the northern region of the study area with amplitudes exceeding 20kW/m. The values decrease gradually towards the Sunda Shelf and reach to their minimum at coastal regions due to bathymetry complexity, shadowing and island obstruction effects. However, the wave power is strongly influenced by seasonality and inter-annual fluctuation. Nine sites representing different sub-regions were selected for further analysis on eligibility of wave farming. Various wave energy statistics including estimated electric power for a number of Wave Energy Converter (WEC) devices showed some stations (Hameau Mo in Vietnamese east coast, Spratly Island, Palawan and Cape Bolinao in west coast of Luzon) have greater eligibility for wave power farming. The estimated electric power that can be produced from these sites using Wave Dragon, an intermediate depth WEC device, ranges from 712 to 1211kW and 935-1680kW for annual and a six-month period from September to February, respectively. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Seasonality; South china sea; Wave power; WAVEWATCH-III™; WEC","Stocker, T.F., Qin, D., Plattner, G.K., Tignor, M., Allen, S.K., Boschung, J., IPCC.

One possibly promising group of demand side technologies in terms of ADR are electric heating systems. These systems could allow to modify their electrical load pattern without affecting the final, thermal energy service they deliver, thanks to the thermal inertia in the system. One of the major remaining obstacles for a large scale roll-out of ADR schemes is the lack of a thorough understanding of interactions between the demand and supply side of the electric power system and the related possible benefits for consumers and producers. Therefore, in this paper, an integrated system model of the electric power system, including electric heating systems (heat pumps and auxiliary resistance heaters) subjected to an ADR scheme, is developed, taking into account the dynamics and constraints on both the supply and demand side of the electric power system. This paper shows that only these integrated system models are able to simultaneously consider all technical and comfort constraints present in the overall system. This allows to accurately assess the benefits for, and interactions of, demand and supply under ADR schemes. Furthermore, we illustrate the effects not captured by traditional, simplified approaches used to represent the demand side (e.g., price elasticity models and virtual generator models) and the supply side (e.g., electricity price profiles and merit order models). Based on these results, we formulate some conclusions which may help modelers in selecting the approach most suited for the problem they would like to study, weighing the complexity and detail of the model. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Active demand response; Demand side management; Electric heating systems; Integrated models; Thermal energy storage","Gellings, C., The concept of demand-side management for electric utilities (1985) Proc IEEE, 73 (10), pp. 1468-1470; Strbac, G., Demand side management: benefits and challenges (2008) Energy Policy, 36 (12), pp. 4419-4426; Warren, P., A review of demand-side management policy in the uk (2014) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 29, pp. 941-951; Pina, A., Silva, C., Ferrão, P., The impact of demand side management strategies in the penetration of renewable electricity (2012) Energy, 41 (1), pp. 128-137; He, X., Hancher, L., Azevedo, I., Keyaerts, N., Meeus, L., Glachant, J.-M., (2013), http://www.eui.eu/Projects/THINK/Documents/Thinktopic/Topic11digital.pdf, Shift, not drift: towards active demand response and beyond, Tech. repArteconi, A., Hewitt, N., Polonara, F., State of the art of thermal storage for demand-side management (2012) Appl Energy, 93, pp. 371-389; Shen, B., Ghatikar, G., Lei, Z., Li, J., Wikler, G., Martin, P., The role of regulatory reforms, market changes, and technology development to make demand response a viable resource in meeting energy challenges (2014) Appl Energy, 130, pp. 814-823; Gils, H.C., Assessment of the theoretical demand response potential in europe (2014) Energy, 67, pp. 1-18; Callaway, D.S., Hiskens, I.A., Achieving controllability of electric loads (2011) Proc IEEE, 99 (1), pp. 184-199; Reynders, G., Nuytten, T., Saelens, D., Potential of structural thermal mass for demand-side management in dwellings (2013) Build Environ, 64, pp. 187-199; Hedegaard, K., Mathiesen, B.V., Lund, H., Heiselberg, P., Wind power integration using individual heat pumps-analysis of different heat storage options (2012) Energy, 47 (1), pp. 284-293; Bergaentzlé, C., Clastres, C., Khalfallah, H., Demand-side management and European environmental and energy goals: an optimal complementary approach (2014) Energy Policy, 67 (APRIL), pp. 858-869; De Jonghe, C., Hobbs, B.F., Belmans, R., Optimal generation mix with short-term demand response and wind penetration (2012) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 27 (2), pp. 830-839; De Jonghe, C., Short-term demand response in electricity generation planning and scheduling [Ph.D. thesis].

Hydrogen fuelling stations are one of the most important parts of the distribution infrastructure required to support the operation of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles and hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles. If there is to be substantial market penetration of hydrogen vehicles in the transport sector, the introduction of commercial hydrogen vehicles and the network of fuelling stations to supply them with hydrogen must take place simultaneously. The present paper thus reviews the current state of the art and deployment of hydrogen fuelling stations. It is found that by 2013, there were 224 working hydrogen stations distributed over 28 countries. Some 43% of these stations were located in North and South America, 34% in Europe, 23% in Asia, and none in Australia. The state of the art in the range of hydrogen production processes is briefly reviewed. The importance of producing hydrogen using renewable energy sources is emphasised for a transition to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to contribute to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. 2.3-5.8/H<inf>2</inf>kg for SMR A classification of hydrogen refuelling stations is introduced, based on the primary energy source used to produce the hydrogen, the production process, and whether the hydrogen is made on site or delivered to the site. The current state of deployment of hydrogen fuelling stations in each major region of the world is then reviewed in detail. The costs of producing hydrogen vary from $1.8 to 2.9/H<inf>2</inf> kg for Coal gasification, 2.3-5.8/H<inf>2</inf> kg for SMR, $6-7.4/H<inf>2</inf> kg for wind power and $6.3-25.4/H<inf>2</inf> kg depending on the cost of the PV system. The lowest cost of hydrogen is nearing competitiveness with petroleum fuels. Finally conclusions are drawn about the progress to date in establishing this crucial component of the infrastructure to enable hydrogen-powered vehicles to become a commercial reality. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

PHYS-V, Athens, Greece","Accurate estimation of extreme wave conditions is critical for offshore renewable energy activities and applications. The use of numerical wind and wave models gives a credible and convenient way of monitoring the general atmospheric and sea state conditions, especially in the absence of sufficient observational networks. However, when focusing on the study of non-frequent cases, in particular over coastal areas, increased uncertainty in the model outputs and accordingly in the reliability of the estimation of extreme waves becomes an important issue. The current study introduces a methodology to validate and post-process outputs from a high resolution numerical wave modeling system for extreme wave estimation based on the significant wave height. This approach is demonstrated through the data analysis at a relatively deep water site, FINO 1, as well as a relatively shallow water area, coastal site Horns Rev, which is located in the North Sea, west of Denmark. The post-processing targets at correcting the modeled time series of the significant wave height, in order to match the statistics of the corresponding measurements, including not only the conventional parameters such as the mean and standard deviation, but also a new parameter, the second-order spectral moment. This second-order spectral moment is essential for extreme value estimation but has so far been neglected in relevant studies. The improved model results are utilized for the estimation of the 50-year values of significant wave height as a characteristic index of extreme wave conditions. The results from the proposed methodology seem to be in a good agreement with the measurements at both the relatively deep, open water and the shallow, coastal water sites, providing a potentially useful tool for offshore renewable energy applications. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Significant wave height; Spectral correction; The 50-year return significant wave height","Aarnes, O.J., Breivik, O., Reistad, M., Wave extremes in the northeast atlantic (2012) JClim, (25), pp. 1529-1543; Abild, J., (1994) Application of the wind atlas method to extremes of wind climatology, , Tech.

This work evaluates to what extent EV fleets (based on empirical driving profiles from two distinct sociodemographic groups) can cover their charging requirements by means of variable renewable generation (wind or solar-PV). For this purpose we formulate a mixed-integer optimization problem minimizing the amount of conventional generation employed. The results indicate that the usage of variable renewable generation can be more than doubled as compared to uncoordinated charging. Furthermore, we analyze how the utilization of renewable generation by EV fleets is affected through different portfolios of renewable generation sources, charging infrastructure specifications as well as a reduced optimization horizon. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Charging coordination; Electric vehicles; Load flexibility; Mixed-integer optimization; Renewable energy","Helms, H., Pehnt, M., Lambrecht, U., Liebich, A., Electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid energy efficiency and life cycle emissions.

Each approach has a distinct objective and, consequently, their conclusions may be inconsistent or contradictory. It is proposed that the integration of elements of QRA and LCA may provide a more holistic approach to health impact assessment. Here we examine the possibility of merging LCA assessed human health impacts with quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) for waterborne pathogen impacts, expressed with the common health metric, disability adjusted life years (DALYs). The example of a recent large-scale water recycling project in Sydney, Australia was used to identify and demonstrate the potential advantages and current limitations of this approach. A comparative analysis of two scenarios - with and without the development of this project - was undertaken for this purpose.LCA and QMRA were carried out independently for the two scenarios to compare human health impacts, as measured by DALYs lost per year. LCA results suggested that construction of the project would lead to an increased number of DALYs lost per year, while estimated disease burden resulting from microbial exposures indicated that it would result in the loss of fewer DALYs per year than the alternative scenario. By merging the results of the LCA and QMRA, we demonstrate the advantages in providing a more comprehensive assessment of human disease burden for the two scenarios, in particular, the importance of considering the results of both LCA and QRA in a comparative assessment of decision alternatives to avoid problem shifting. The application of DALYs as a common measure between the two approaches was found to be useful for this purpose. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon footprint; Environmental impact; Water recycling; Water treatment","Alvarez-Gaitan, J.P., Peters, G.M., Rowley, H.V., Moore, S., Short, M.D., A hybrid life cycle assessment of water treatment chemicals: an Australian experience (2013) Int.

The geographical coverage of the model comprises Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxemburg, Great Britain and Ireland. The model simulates the electricity market operation for the entire region at half hourly resolution and produces results in terms of electricity prices, cross border flows, emissions and associated total system costs. The impact of two carbon prices is examined within the model. Results highlight the policy challenges that arise when individual Member States formulate renewable energy plans in isolation in the absence of integrated modelling of interconnected regions as cross border power flows play a more significant role in market dynamics especially in the presence of geographically dispersed variable renewable generation sources such as wind and solar. From a policy perspective results suggest that based on these national plans, congestion will be present on a number of key lines at long periods during the year. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity; European market integration; Market modelling","Battaglini, A., Brtnik, P., Komendantova, N., Patt, A., Perceptions of barriers for expansion of electricity grids in the European Union (2012) Energy Policy, 47, pp. 254-259; Meeus, L., Purchala, K., Belmans, R., Development of the internal electricity market in Europe (2005) Electr J, 18 (6), pp. 25-35; Balaguer, J., Cross-border integration in the European electricity market.

Policymakers have recognized this potential and over the last decade have intensified their efforts towards creating a conducive regulatory and policy framework. Policy instruments such as renewable obligations, feed-in-tariffs and generation based incentives have specially aided the transformation towards large scale generation, enabling higher efficiency and lower costs of generation. However, financing has emerged as a significant barrier for sustaining the momentum gained in recent years. Given this background this paper provides an overview on the evolution of large scale generation and the consequent changes in financing requirements. It further reviews the emerging trends and barriers in the financing landscape and analyses the impact of policy performance in this context. Finally, it considers the design of a national renewable finance framework complete with targeted finance push instruments that can complement existing demand pull policies in facilitating investment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, ionospheric refraction affects GNSS reflections detected at low Earth orbit (LEO). While multifrequency GNSS enables the elimination of most of the ionospheric error, single-frequency missions are still susceptible to this ranging delay. Motivated by the planned launch of Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) in 2016, a single-frequency reflectometry mission, this letter presents a simulation of the relative ionospheric delay that will shift the Delay-Doppler Map (DDM) data product. A mathematical model is presented that defines and characterizes signal propagation delay in the DDM. The model differentiates direct and reflected signals as a sum of path lengths, atmospheric refraction effects, and noise. We simulate representative ionospheric delays from the model associated with the direct and reflected ray paths as a function of satellite elevation angle, latitude, and solar activity. Simulation using the International Reference Ionosphere 2007 shows that differential ionospheric content is inversely proportional to satellite elevation angle and that low latitudes present larger ionospheric impacts on the reflected signals. Finally, high solar activity conditions lift the ionospheric density profile to and possibly above the CYGNSS orbit altitude of 500 km. The ionospheric delay will not generally affect the estimation of wind speed but may affect the CYGNSS signal acquisition and open loop tracking process. Implications of the ionospheric delay in other GNSS reflectometry applications are also discussed. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) (CYGNSS); Delay-Doppler Map (DDM); Global Positioning System (GPS); GNSS-R; GNSS-reflected signals; ionosphere; ionospheric effects; reflectometry; total electron content (TEC)","Gleason, S., Gommenginger, C., Cromwell, D., Fading statistics and sensing accuracy of ocean scattered GNSS and altimetry signals (2010) J.

The Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation turbulence model is applied to obtain the instantaneous turbulent flow field. The noise prediction is carried out using the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings acoustic analogy. Simulations are performed for three different inflow conditions, U = 7, 10, 15 m/s. The capability of the Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation turbulence model in massive separation is verified with available experimental data for pressure coefficient. The broadband noises of the turbulent boundary layers and the tonal noises due to the blade passing frequency are predicted via flow field noise simulation. The contribution of the thickness, loading and quadrupole noises are investigated, separately. The results indicated that there is a direct relation between the strength of the radiated noise and the wind speed. Furthermore, the effect of the receiver location on the Overall Sound Pressure Level is investigated. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Aerodynamic noise; Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine; Turbulence; Wind turbine noise","Mostafaeipour, A., Economic evaluation of small wind turbine utilization in Kerman, Iran (2013) Energy Convers Manage, 73, pp. 214-225; Mohamed, M., Janiga, G., Pap, E., Thévenin, D., Optimal blade shape of a modified Savonius turbine using an obstacle shielding the returning blade (2011) Energy Convers Manage, 52, pp. 236-242; Al-Hadhrami, L.M., Performance evaluation of small wind turbines for off grid applications in Saudi Arabia (2014) Energy Convers Manage, 81, pp. 19-29; Jianu, O., Rosen, M.A., Naterer, G., Noise pollution prevention in wind turbines: Status and recent advances (2012) Sustainability, 4, pp. 1104-1117; Wagner, S., Bareiss, R., Guidati, G., Wagner-Bareiß-Guidati (1996) Wind Turbine Noise; Stone, C., Lynch, C.E., Smith, M.J., Hybrid RANS/LES simulations of a Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine 48th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting, AIAA-2010-459, , Orlando, FL2010; Tadamasa, A., Zangeneh, M., Numerical prediction of wind turbine noise (2011) Renew Energy, 36, pp. 1902-1912; Cho, T., Kim, C., Lee, D., Acoustic measurement for 12% scaled model of NREL Phase VI wind turbine by using beamforming (2010) Current Appl Phys, 10, pp. S320-S325; Chourpouliadis, C., Ioannou, E., Koras, A., Kalfas, A.I., Comparative study of the power production and noise emissions impact from two wind farms (2012) Energy Convers Manage, 60, pp. 233-242; Göçmen, T., Özerdem, B., Airfoil optimization for noise emission problem and aerodynamic performance criterion on small scale wind turbines (2012) Energy, 46, pp. 62-71; Mo, J.-O., Lee, Y.-H., Numerical simulation for prediction of aerodynamic noise characteristics on a HAWT of NREL Phase VI (2011) J Mech Sci Technol, 25, pp. 1341-1349; Lee, S., Lee, S., Numerical and experimental study of aerodynamic noise by a small wind turbine (2014) Renew Energy, 65, pp. 108-112; Mohamed, M., Aero-acoustics noise evaluation of H-rotor Darrieus wind turbines (2014) Energy, 65, pp. 596-604; Simms, D.A., Schreck, S., Hand, M., Fingersh, L., (2001) NREL Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment in the NASA-Ames Wind Tunnel: A Comparison of Predictions to Measurements, , National Renewable Energy Laboratory Colorado, USA; Menter, F.R., Two-equation eddy-viscosity turbulence models for engineering applications (1994) AIAA J, 32, pp. 1598-1605; Xiao, L., Xiao, Z., Duan, Z., Fu, S., Improved-Delayed-Detached-Eddy Simulation of cavity-induced transition in hypersonic boundary layer (2014) Int J Heat Fluid Flow, 51, pp. 138-150; Shur, M.L., Spalart, P.R., Strelets, M.K., Travin, A.K., A hybrid RANS-LES approach with delayed-DES and wall-modelled LES capabilities (2008) Int J Heat Fluid Flow, 29, pp. 1638-1649; Williams, J.F., Hawkings, D.L., Sound generation by turbulence and surfaces in arbitrary motion (1969) Philos Trans R Soc London Ser A, Math Phys Sci, 264, pp. 321-342; Lighthill, M.J., On sound generated aerodynamically.

The heat source is simulated solar radiation heating a double walled evacuated tube. The heat sink is a CPU cooler subjected to simulated wind energy. The peak power performance of the STEG for a fixed heat input and a varying forced convection brought upon by the artificial wind is reported.

A real villa has been chosen to act as a case study for this research. A detailed analysis of the annual energy performance of the case study has been performed through the use of a computerised simulation, the results of which were verified with and checked against actual utility bills for a whole year. The energy consumption of the base case study has been compared with that resulting from different natural ventilation strategies.

However, the Chinese power sector has not undergone the necessary reforms to facilitate the integration and absorption of a larger share of variable renewable energy. This is evident from the difficulties in absorbing wind power from already commissioned wind farms and the resultant curtailment of wind power. Pumped storage hydroelectricity (PSH) is a flexible power source that can facilitate higher penetration levels of wind power as well as complement China's growing nuclear power capacity. However, regulatory policy constraints have restricted the effective utilization of existing PSH capacity and discouraged investment in new PSH capacity. This paper examines these constraints and assesses the likely impact of new policies designed to address them. Finally, policy recommendations and concluding remarks are provided. This paper contributes to the literature on renewable energy integration from a new perspective.

Transitioning from a fossil fuel-based energy system to a system based on RES is a process in which the RES penetration must be guided by specific targets in the medium term. Moreover, the relative contributions from RES and fossil fuels in every stage of the transition process must be identified through clear optimization criteria. In this article, we propose a methodology denoted the Minimum Total Mix Capacity (MTMC) to determine the optimal mix of RES and fossil fuels in an electricity system by taking into account the hourly values of RES production and electricity demand. The MTMC methodology is applied to the Mexican electricity system, which greatly depends on fossil fuels. The Mexican Congress mandated that the fossil fuel-based electricity generation be limited to 65% by the year 2024, 60% by 2035 and 50% by 2050. We use the MTMC methodology to investigate the potential for RES integration into the Mexican electricity system by constructing three scenarios (low, mid and high biomass) to achieve the 2024 target and analyze the system's response to varying contributions of wind and solar power production to the scenarios. The minimum complementary capacity based on fossil fuels that is needed to cover the demand without electricity imports is assessed to determine the total mix capacity for the transition system. Using the MTMC methodology, several combinations of biomass, wind and solar power that achieve a minimum of 35% RES electricity production are identified; however, there is only one combination that results in the minimum overall capacity, hence resulting in the optimal mix. Moreover, a domain of near-optimal mix combinations can be identified among all of the scenarios, which may also be considered as an alternative. Biomass has the highest effectiveness in terms of high RES production and the lowest required overall power generating capacity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity system; Energy mix optimization; Energy systems analyses; Mexico; Renewable energy","Østergaard, P.A., Sperling, K., Towards sustainable energy planning and management (2014) Int J Sustainable Energy Plan Manage, 1, pp. 1-5; Secretariat of the Interior (SEGOB, Secretaría de Gobernación) (2008), pp. 95-102. , Law for use of renewable energies and financing of energy transition (Ley para el aprovechamiento de las energías renovables y el financiamiento de la transición energética), Official Diary of the Federation (DOF-Diario Oficial de la Federación) Mexico City, 28 NovemberProspective of the Electricity Sector 2012-2026 (Prospectiva del Sector Eléctrico 2012-2026) (2012), Mexico CityRenewable Energies Prospective 2012-2026 (Prospectiva de Energías Renovables 2012-2026).

At the meso-scale is a numerical weather-prediction code, which is typically based on the compressible-flow Euler equations. At the micro-scale, surrounding one or more wind turbines, is a computational fluid dynamics code, which is typically based on the incompressible-flow Navier-Stokes equations. When calculating short-duration flow around wind turbines, one-way coupling is sufficient, where the meso-scale computational model drives the micro-scale model. However, in long-duration simulations involving large wind farms, the influence of the wind farm on the meso-scale weather may no longer be insignificant and two-way coupling is warranted. In this study, we focus on a simple two-dimensional system, for which our goal is to devise one- and two-way coupling algorithms that can effectively transport a vortex propagating in laminar flow from one domain to the other. Two coupling schemes and their numerical implementation are described: partial-boundary coupling and projection coupling. In the former, the micro-scale-domain boundary is decomposed, based on the meso-scale solution, into sections corresponding to inflow and outflow. The micro-scale model has Dirichlet- and Neumann-type boundary conditions on these sections, respectively. In projection coupling, the meso-scale solution is projected onto the incompressible-flow solution space in the micro-scale domain, from which Dirichlet-type boundary conditions are derived. In these simulations, the uncoupled meso-scale solution is taken as the reference, and the best coupling method is that which produces solutions that deviate the least from the reference. In one-way coupling, under a simple two-dimensional laminar-flow test case, partial-boundary coupling was more effective than projection coupling. However, in two-way coupling, projection coupling was the best performer. © 2015.","Computational fluid dynamics; Model coupling; Multi-scale; Numerical weather prediction; Wind energy","(2012) Complex Flow Workshop Report, , January 17-18, 2012, University of Colorado, Boulder, US Department of Energy, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Wind Program; Barthelmie, R.J., Jensen, L.E., Evaluation of wind farm efficiency and wind turbine wakes at the Nysted offshore wind farm (2010) Wind Energy, 13, pp. 573-586; Churchfield, M.J., Lee, S., Moriarty, M.J., Martinez, L.A., Leonardi, S., Vijayakumar, G., A large-eddy simulation of wind-plant aerodynamics (2012) Proceedings of the 50th AIAA aerospace sciences meeting, , Nashville, TN; Musial, W., Butterfield, S., McNiff, B., Improving wind turbine gearbox reliability (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 European wind energy conference, , Milan, Italy; Sprague, M.A., Moriarty, P.J., Churchfield, M.J., Gruchalla, K., Lee, S., Lundquist, J., Computational modeling of wind-plant aerodynamics (2011) Proceedings of SciDAC 2011; Skamarock, W.C., Klemp, J.B., Dudhia, J., Gill, G., Barker, D., Wang, W., A description of the advanced research WRF version 2 (2005) Technical Report NCAR/TN-468+STR, NCAR; (2009) User's Manual, , Version 1.6.

The setup considered in this paper is based on a pumping cycle. It generates energy by winching out at high tether forces, driving an electrical generator while flying crosswind. Then it winches in at a stationary neutral position, thus leaving a net amount of generated energy.The focus of this paper is put on the flight control design, which implements an accurate direction control towards target points and allows for a flight with an eight-down pattern. An extended overview on the control system approach, as well as details of each element of the flight controller, is presented. The control architecture is motivated by a simple, yet comprehensive model for the kite dynamics.In addition, winch strategies based on an optimization scheme are presented. In order to demonstrate the real world functionality of the presented algorithms, flight data from a fully automated pumping-cycle operation of a small-scale prototype are given. The setup is based on a 30m2 kite linked to a ground-based 50kW electrical motor/generator by a single line. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Airborne wind energy; Crosswind flight; Flight control; Kite power; Pumping cycle; Tethered kites","(2013) Airborne wind energy, green energy and technology, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-39965-7, Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, U.

The proposed scheme uses both the grid- and rotor-side power converters of doubly fed induction generator to inject PV power into the grid. Thus, it renders a cost-effective solution to PV-grid integration by obviating the need for a dedicated converter for PV power processing. The system is able to feed significantly large PV power into the grid compared to an equivalent rating inverter used in the conventional PV-grid system. The proposed scheme prevents circulating power during subsynchronous operation during the availability of solar radiation. All these features enhance system efficiency. System stability is also augmented due to turbine inertia, facilitating high PV penetration into the power grid. The intermittent but complementary nature of solar PV and wind energy sources considerably improves the converters' utilization. Besides, the proposed scheme does not hamper maximum power point tracking of PV and wind sources except during very rarely occurring environmental glitches, which the PV power control algorithm is suitably geared to handle. A comprehensive system model is presented and used for designing the control strategy. The proposed scheme is supported by analysis, simulations, and experiments on a laboratory prototype. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Converter control; dc-ac converter; doubly fed induction machine; hybrid system,maximum power point tracking (MPPT); solar photovoltaic (PV); wind generation","Carrasco, J., Franquelo, L., Bialasiewicz, J., Galvan, E., Guisado, R., Prats, M.M.A., Leon, J., Moreno-Alfonso, N., Power-electronic systems for the grid integration of renewable energy sources: A survey (2006) IEEE Trans.

Here, we examine the results of a 2013 mail survey of individuals residing in the vicinity of a 2. MW wind turbine that is located on the edge of the historic coastal town of Lewes, Delaware in the United States, and adjacent to Delaware Bay and the Great Marsh Preserve. The wind turbine, which was constructed in 2010, primarily serves the University of Delaware's coastal campus, and to a lesser extent the town of Lewes. Seventy-eight percent hold positive or very positive attitudes toward the wind turbine, with only 10% having negative or very negative attitudes, and 82% like the look of the wind turbine. Socially constructed aspects find more resonance than physical ones (e.g., attractiveness) in explaining this latter finding, with the wind turbine being reflective of a transformation to a clean energy future for those residents who like the way the turbine looks. On the other hand, those objecting to its look, find the turbine does not fit the landscape. Policy implications of these findings and others related to wind turbine sound are considered, and recommendations for better understanding of proposed developments from the vantage point of the affected communities, including how a community views itself and its surrounding landscape, are made. © 2015 The Authors.","Community wind; Landscape; Social acceptance; Wind turbine sound","Aitken, M., Wind power and community benefits: challenges and opportunities (2010) Energy Policy, 38, pp. 6066-6075; Atkinson-Palombo, C., Hoen, B., (2014) Relationship Between Wind Turbines and Residential Property Values in Massachusetts, , University of Connecticut; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Boston; Bakker, R.H., Pedersen, E., van der Berg, G.P., Stewart, R.E., Lok, W., Bouma, J., Impact of wind turbine sound on annoyance, self-reported sleep disturbance and psychological distress (2012) Sci.

Among different types of wind turbines, due to several advantages, permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) is attractive concept. Since the penetration level of wind power in the grid is increased, therefore, wind power can influence to the grid and vice versa. Some of the important problems in the grid are fault condition and voltage sags. These conditions may affect the operation of wind turbine. In order to enhance low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability in PMSG-based wind turbines, various approaches have been proposed in the last years. In this paper, the review and comparison of several LVRT capability enhancement methods is performed. The two foremost types of LVRT capability enhancement methods are external devices based methods and modified controller based methods. The main objectives of this paper are to introduce performances of different LVRT capability enhancement methods and use of some LVRT capability enhancement methods in PMSG based wind turbine which are applied in other kind of wind power generators. The external devices based methods can be effective but some of these methods are of significant cost. According to the literatures, modified controller based methods can reduce the LVRT capability enhancement cost. Several modified controller based methods have been proposed for LVRT capability enhancement. To compare the mentioned methods, several simulations are performed in MATLAB software. From the review of simulation results, series connection of FACTS devices and modification of back-to-back converter controllers are the highly efficient LVRT capability enhancement approaches. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.","Fault condition;

Because siting bottom-mounted turbines in most nearshore coastal zones is either impractical or politically difficult, turbine developers are testing floating-platform turbine technologies for deeper waters. Deepwater, floating-platform turbines have the advantages of being sited in the highest quality winds farther offshore, movable if desired, and located beyond the horizon, out of sight from shore. This paper reports on conversations with 103 coastal stakeholders at community meetings regarding development and testing of floating turbines off the coast of Maine, U.S.A. Using naturalistic field methods, this essay reports common questions and concerns of commercial lobstermen, fishermen, and coastal civic leaders. Early-stage conversations suggest that once coastal community members understand the benefits and impacts of wind farm development on their quality of life, many share specific preferences for where offshore developments could be located. Citizens' remarks are sophisticated, nuanced, and innovative and include robust ideas for pairing turbine siting with fishery conservation. Findings imply that when looking to site offshore turbines in public, multiple-use ocean spaces, developers, planners, and coastal communities should engage early and often in two-way conversation rather than one-way outreach. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Citizen-engaged; Common-pool resources; Environmental communication; Gulf of Maine; Social science; Sustainability science","Acheson, J.M., (1988) The lobster gangs of Maine, , University Press of New England, Lebanon, NH; Alexander, K., Wilding, T., Heymans, J., Attitudes of Scottish fishers towards marine renewable energy (2013) Mar Policy, 37, pp. 239-244; Bourdieu, P., Handbook of theory and research for the sociology of education (1986) The forms of capital, pp. 241-258. , New York, Greenwood, J.

The present study thus proposes utilizing an accurate numerical-probabilistic algorithm which is the combination of the Newton's technique and the maximum entropy (ME) method to determine an important distribution in the renewable energy systems, namely the hyper Rayleigh distribution (HRD) which belongs to the family of Weibull distribution. The HRD is mainly used to model the wind speed and the variations of the solar irradiance level with a negligible error. The purpose of this research is to find the unique solution to an optimization problem which occurs when maximizing Shannon's entropy. To confirm the accuracy and efficiency of our algorithm, we used the long-term data for the average daily wind speed in Toyokawa for 12 yr to examine the Rayleigh distribution (RD). This data set was obtained from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in Japan. It seems that the RD is more closely fitted to the data. In addition, we presented different simulation studies to check the reliability of the proposed algorithm.

This paper presents a novel control methodology for a three-phase induction machine working as a single-phase dual winding induction generator. Three-phase induction machines providing single-phase output with proper control strategy can be beneficial in grid secluded micro-wind energy conversion systems compared to single-phase induction generators. Three-phase induction machines operating in single-phase mode are mostly excited asymmetrically to provide single-phase power leading to unbalanced current flow in the stator windings causing heating and insulation breakdown. The asymmetrical excitation also initiates torque pulsations which results in additional stress and vibration at the machine shaft and bearings degrading the machine performance. The proposed control is chiefly aimed to minimize this unbalance. The variable excitation required for the proposed generator is provided through a single-phase inverter with photovoltaic panels. The suitability for such a generator along with its control is tested with appropriate simulations and experimental results.

In this paper, the RSC is controlled to achieve four different control targets, including balanced stator current, sinusoidal rotor current, smooth stator active and reactive powers, and constant DFIG electromagnetic torque. The GSC is commanded to keep the dc voltage at a constant value. Additional feedback compensators using resonant regulators for the RSC are employed, and the decompositions of the positive and negative sequence components and calculations of the rotor negative current references can be avoided. Another similar compensator is used in the GSC to suppress the dc voltage fluctuates and remove the GSC reactive power oscillations without the stator or rotor power information. The proposed method can make the RSC and GSC available to an independent operation with a simple implementation for higher reliability. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for both the RSC and GSC under unbalanced grid voltage conditions. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG); independent operation; resonant regulator; unbalanced grid voltage; wind energy conversion system (WECS)","Liserre, M., Cardenas, R., Molinas, M., Rodriguez, J., Overview of multi-MW wind turbines and wind parks (2011) IEEE Trans.

This investigation considers the impact of the Cryogenic Carbon Capture™ (CCC) process on transitional power generation. The CCC process consumes less energy than chemical and physical absorption processes and has an energy storage capability that shifts the parasitic loss of the CCC process away from peak hours. The CCC process responds rapidly to the variation of electricity demand and has a time constant that is consistent with the intermittent supply from renewable power sources. The hybrid system of conventional and renewable power generation units and the CCC process are optimized in this investigation. The system under consideration consists of load-following coal and gas-fired power units, a CCC process, and wind generation. The objective is to meet the residential and CCC plant electricity demands while maximizing the operating profit. The results demonstrate that an average profit of $35k/hr is obtained from this hybrid system over the selected days. The total electricity demand is best met using a combination of coal, gas, and wind power with grid-scale energy storage. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cryogenic Carbon Capture; Dynamic optimization; Fossil-fueled power production; Renewable energy generation","Key world energy statistics, , http://www.iea.org, [accessed November 2014]; Wang, Y., Ronilaya, F., Chen, X., Roskilly, A.P., Modelling and simulation of a distributed power generation system with energy storage to meet dynamic household electricity demand (2013) Appl Therm Eng, 50 (1), pp. 523-535; http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/global.html, [accessed November 2014]http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/co2.html, [accessed November 2014]http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/news_docs/pbl-2013-trends-in-global-co2-emissions-2013-report-1148.pdf, Tech. rep.

The gas deposition of PFASs played a key role during deposition to marine ecosystem. Sensitivity analysis showed that wind speed was the most sensitive parameter for gas deposition fluxes.

Consequently, seeking clean methods of producing electricity is a most crucial endeavor at this time. The shrinking reserves of oil have added urgency to the matter as well. One other recognized source of renewable energy besides wind, water, and solar (WWS) is geothermal energy, which has been proven to be useful in baseload power generation, a significant advantage over WWS. As compared to fossil fuels, geothermal energy is not subjected to the supply and cost fluctuations of which fuel is at risk. To date, there have been a number of innovative procedures explored to use geothermal energy to produce electricity. A relatively innovative yet not uncommon method has been to use hot solid rocks to heat water and pump the superheated water to use in power plants. These rocks are generally underground and at higher temperatures due to their proximity to volcanoes or natural geothermal vents. The water goes deeper down into the earth's crust to become superheated by the rocks, and then is pumped out to power turbines, and subsequently returned into the ground to repeat the process. In Krafla, Iceland, during their Icelandic Deep Drilling Project (IDDP) in 2009, a borehole was accidentally dug into the magma at 2100 m. The temperature of this magma was about 900-1000 °C. A steel casing with perforations on the flat side was cemented into the well bottom. This design was to slow the heat flow, and superheated steam was made for the following two years till July 2012. The steam reached temperatures of 450 °C and was at high pressures. Krafla was the world's first magma-enhanced geothermal system (EGS) to generate electricity. This paper will explore the feasibility of using geothermal power plant methods as a sustainable source of clean energy. Geothermal energy has tremendous potential if the right methods can be found to tap that potential, as well as if the cost may be brought down by innovation and demand. In addition, an innovative method, which already exists in some form, is proposed in the current review to harness more geothermal energy for use. © 2015 by ASME.",,"(2012) Renewables 2012 Global Status Report, , REN21, Paris, France, Report No. REN21; Figure 2.0 primary energy consumption by source and sector, 2011 (2011) Annual Energy Review, Last Accessed February, 28, p. 1. , EIA, 2014; Burgess, J., Volcanic shield can protect from eruptions and generate electricity (2013) Oilprice, Last Accessed February, 10, p. 1. , 2014; Foley, J.A., Earth's core temperature a hellish 6000 degrees celsius, new study confirms (2013) Nature World News, Last Accessed March, 1, p. 1. , 2014; (2010) Geothermal Energy, p. 1. , Anonymous, 2010, Newberry Geothermal, last accessed March 1, 2014; Lund, J.W., Boyd, T., Small geothermal power project examples (1999) Geo-Heat Center Bulletin, 20 (2), pp. 9-26; Bertani, R., Thain, I., (2002) Geothermal Power Generating Plant CO2 Emission Survey, p. 49. , IGA News; Lecher, C., (2013) Could A Volcano Power America?, p. 1. , Popular Science, last accessed February 8, 2014; Barnard, J., (2012) Newberry Volcano: Geothermal Energy Advocates in Oregon Have High Hopes, p. 1. , Huffpost Green, last accessed February 10, 2014; Phillips, A., (2014) Iceland, Magma Used to Create Geothermal Power for First Time, p. 1. , Thinkprogress, last accessed February 7, 2014; Pittalwala, I., (2014) World's First Magma-Enhanced Geothermal System Created in Iceland, p. 1. , UCR Today, last accessed February 8, 2014; Fridleifsson, I., Bertani, R., Huenges, E., (2008) The Possible Role and Contribution of Geothermal Energy to the Mitigation of Climate Change, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Lubeck, Germany; (2006) The Future of Geothermal Energy, , MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, INL/EXT-06-11746, Boston; Simkin, T., (2013) This Dynamic Planet, , http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/2800/ion, retrieved March 11, 2014; (2014) Global Geothermal Supply and Demand, , http://jcwinnie.biz/wordpress/?p=2599, retrieved March 11; Rybach, L., Geothermal sustainability (2007) Geo-Heat Centre Quarterly Bulletin, 28. , Oregon Institute of Technology, Klamath Falls, OR; (2014) Geothermal Basics Current Use, , http://www.geo-energy.org/currentUse.aspx, retrieved March 11; (2012) Key World Energy Statistics, International Energy Agency, , IEA, Paris, France; 2013 Geothermal power: International market overview (2014) Geothermal Energy Association, , http://geo-energy.org/events/2013%20International%20Report%20Final.pdf, retrieved March 26; (2012) Cost and Performance Data for Power Generation Technologies, , http://bv.com/docs/reports-studies/nrel-cost-report.pdf, 20 Black and Veatch, Prepared for NREL, document February, 2012, retrieved June 24, 2014; Hillesheim, M., Mosey, G., (2013) Feasibility Study of Economics and Performance of Geothermal Power Generation at the Lakeview Uranium Mill Site in Lakeview, , Oregon Report No. NREL/TP-6A10-60251; Gerber, L., Marechal, F., (2012) Design of Geothermal Energy Conversion Systems with A Life Cycle Perspective, , The 37th Workshop Geothermal Reservoir Engineering Stanford University, Stanford, CA, January 30-February 1, Paper No. SGP-TR-194; Coskun, C., Oktay, Z., Dincer, I., Performance evaluations of a geothermal power plant (2011) Appl.

In addition, it introduces a probabilistic framework based on a scenario-based method to overcome all the uncertainties in the optimal energy management of MGs with different renewable power sources, such as Photovoltaic (PV), Wind Turbine (WT), Micro Turbine (MT), and storage devices. Therefore, the uncertainty is considered for WT and PV output power variations, load demand forecasting error and grid bid changes at the same time. It is hard to solve MG problem with all its uncertainty for 24-h time intervals, and consider several equality and inequality at the same time. In fact, in order to resolve this issue, the problem needs one powerful technique that although it converges very fast, it escapes from the local optima. As a result, one modern Dolphin echolocation optimization algorithm (DEOA) is defined to explore all the search space globally. The DEO algorithm uses the ability of echolocation of the dolphins to find the best location. Additionally, the proposed modification method will be introduced in this paper. This method makes the algorithm work better and finds the locations faster. The proposed method is implemented on a test grid-connected MG and satisfying results can be seen after implementation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a multi-resolution Cartesian mesh refinement method for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, while the standard k-ε turbulence model is employed to resolve stratified turbulent flows. Hanging nodes are used to facilitate the implementation of high order discretization schemes and the algebraic system of the discretized differential equations is solved with a generic modified Alternating Direction Implicit (m-ADI) method developed to resolve locally refined grids. The overall performance of the new flow solver is initially evaluated against experimental data related to the laminar flow past a square cylinder for Reynolds numbers, defined based on the mean ambient wind speed and the characteristic length scale, of 87≤Re≤250 and neutral thermal stratification. The unsteady character of the flow field is successfully predicted and the grid refinement approach enables accurate low cost and low blockage simulations. The flow solver is applied to simulate the flow over thermally stratified idealized urban areas. Good agreement with experimental measurements, where the bulk Richardson number was defined based on the mean wind speed at the top of the reference street canyon, is obtained for -0.21≤R<inf>b</inf>≤0.78 while the grid refinement method allowed simulation of the experimental setup in detail, including all the roughness elements and the idealized street canyons. The numerical calculations indicate that even weak thermal stability can lead to laminarization of the induced flow field; reducing at the same time the potential for air mixing and results to air degradation. Even though the recirculation patterns are influenced under weak thermal stratification, extreme thermal instability within the region of -16≤R<inf>b</inf>≤-64 with Re=6800 results to the development of two counter-rotating vortices of equivalent kinetic energy. However, the linear correlation of the average kinetic energy at the roof-level with the R<inf>b</inf> number indicates that the buoyancy forces determine the air mixing levels. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Atmospheric stability; Cartesian grid refinement; M-ADI solver; Street canyon; Thermal stratification; Urban environment","Allegrini, J., Dorer, V., Carmeliet, J., Buoyant flows in street canyons. validation of CFD simulations with wind tunnel measurements (2014) Build.

Terrain spectra can quantitatively reflect the effect of topographic dynamic forcing on the atmosphere. In wavelength space, topographic spectral energy decreases with decreasing wavelength, in spite of several departures. This relationship is approximated by an exponential function. A power law relationship between the terrain height spectra and wavelength is fitted by the least-squares method, and the fitting slope is associated with grid-size selection for mesoscale models. The monotonicity of grid size is investigated, and it is strictly proved that grid size increases with increasing fitting exponent, indicating that the universal grid size is determined by the minimum fitting exponent. An example of landslide-prone areas in western Sichuan is given, and the universal grid spacing of 4.1 km is shown to be a requirement to resolve 90% of terrain height variance for mesoscale models, without resorting to the parameterization of subgrid-scale terrain variance. Comparison among results of different simulations shows that the simulations estimate the observed precipitation well when using a resolution of 4.1 km or finer. Although the main flow patterns are similar, finer grids produce more complex patterns that show divergence zones, convergence zones and vortices. Horizontal grid size significantly affects the vertical structure of the convective boundary layer. Stronger vertical wind components are simulated for finer grid resolutions. In particular, noticeable sinking airflows over mountains are captured for those model configurations. © 2015, Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","fitting exponent; model sensitivity; monotonically increasing function; terrain spectra; the universal grid size","Ansoult, M.M., Circular sampling for fourier analysis of digital terrain data (1989) Mathematical Geolog, 21, pp. 401-410; Boer, G.J., Shepherd, T.G., Large-scale two-dimensional turbulence in the atmosphere (1983) J.

This study made use of these RO data to study the morphology of ionosphere equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) statistically during 2006-2014. The ionospheric peak density (NmF2) and peak height (hmF2) derived from the RO electron density profiles as well as the derived magnetic latitude of both crests and trough, the trough width, and the crest-to-trough ratio (CTR) of NmF2 are analyzed systematically. The corresponding seasonal, local time, and solar activity variations and the hemispheric asymmetry are identified and discussed. Most morphology agree well with previous studies and could be explained by the corresponding variations of neutral wind/composition and ExB vertical drift. We also found some interesting features. During May-August, magnetic latitude of the trough could be up to ~5° north of the equator especially around noontime, and the local time difference corresponding best developed EIA between both hemispheres could be up to ~6. h. Both crests even move equator-ward with the increase of solar activity in the morning sector except June solstice. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","COSMIC; Crest-to-Trough Ratio (CTR); Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA); GPS; Ionosphere; Radio Occultation","Abdu, M.A., Pancheva, D., (2011) Aeronomy of the Earth's Atmosphere and Ionosphere, , IAGA Special Sopron, Book Series 2, A.

In order to comprehensively understand the heat transfer characteristics of air cooling system, the air cooling numerical simulation battery models for cylindrical lithium-ion power battery pack were established in this paper, and a detailed parametric investigation was undertaken to study effects of different ventilation types and velocities, gap spacing between neighbor batteries, temperatures of environment and entrance air, amount of single row cells and battery diameter on the thermal management performance of battery pack. The results showed that the local temperature difference increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of wind speed. Reversing the air flow direction between adjacent rows is not necessarily appropriate and the gap spacing should not be too small and too large. It is prone to thermal runaway when the ambient temperature is too high, and the most suitable value of S/D (the ratio of spacing distance between neighbor cells and cell diameter) is gradually reduced along with the increase of cell diameter. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Air cooling; Local temperature difference; Maximum temperature; Power battery; Thermal management","Hannan, M.A., Azidin, F.A., Mohamed, A., Multi-sources model and control algorithm of an energy management system for light electric vehicles (2012) Energy Convers.

In order to extract this energy efficiency, the reliability of such technologies is critical if pay back periods and power generation requirements are to be met. Due to recent developments in the field of wind engineering and in particular the expansion of installed capacity around the world, the need for reliable and intelligent diagnostic tools is of greater importance. The number of offshore wind turbines installed in the seas around Britain’s coasts is likely to increase from just fewer than 150–7,500 over the next 10 years with the potential cost of £10 billion. Operation and Maintenance activities are estimated to be 35 % against the cost of electricity. However, the development of appropriate and efficient maintenance strategies is currently lacking in the wind industry. The current reliability and failure modes of offshore wind turbines are known and have been used to develop preventive and corrective maintenance strategies which have done little to improve reliability. In addition, the failure of one minor component can cause escalated damage to a major component, which can increase repair and or replacement costs. A reliability centered maintenance (RCM) approach offers considerable benefit to the management of wind turbine operations since it includes an appreciation of the impact of faults on operations. Due to the high costs involved in performing maintenance and the even higher costs associated with failures and subsequent downtime and repair, it is critical that the impacts are considered when maintenance is planned. This paper provides an overview of the application of RCM and on line e-condition monitoring to wind turbine maintenance management. Unplanned maintenance levels can be reduced by increasing the reliability of the gear box and individual gears through the analysis of lubricants. Finally the paper will discuss the development of a complete sensor-based processing unit that can continuously monitor the wind turbines lubricated systems and provide, via wireless technology, real time data enabling on shore staff with the ability to predict degradation anticipate problems and take remedial action before damage and failure occurs. © 2014, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","E-maintenance; Gearboxes; Oil analysis; RCM; Wind turbines","Baglee, A., Modern maintenance practices: the barriers to implementation within small/medium enterprises (2006) In, , International conference on modeling in industrial maintenance and reliability, Salford, UK; Baldwin, A., Lunt S (2010) Latest developments in online oil condition monitoring sensors (2010) The seventh international conference on condition monitoring and machinery failure prevention technologies (BINDT CM; http://www.wwindea.org/technology/ch03/en/3_4_3.html, Barber S, Golbeck P (2010) The benefits of a pro-active approach using preventive and predictive maintenance tools and strategies—actual examples and case studies.

GTEM-C is a hybrid model that combines the top-down macroeconomic representation of a computable general equilibrium model with the bottom-up engineering details of energy production. The model features detailed accounting for global energy flows that are embedded in traded energy goods, and it offers a unified framework to analyse the energy-carbon-environment nexus. As an illustrative example, we present simulation results on global energy transformation under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's representative carbon pathways 4.5 and 8.5. By testing the model's sensitivity to the relevant parameter, we find that the pace of electrification will significantly contain the spiking of carbon prices because electricity can be produced from carbon-free or less carbon-intensive technologies. The decoupling of energy use and carbon footprint, due to the uptake of clean electricity technologies, such as nuclear, wind, solar, and carbon capture and storage, allows the world to maintain high level of energy consumption, which is essential to economic growth. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon mitigation policy; Computable general equilibrium; Hybrid model; Integrated assessment","Akhtar, M., Wibe, J., Simonovic, S., MacGee, J., Integrated assessment model of society-biosphere-climate-economy-energy system (2013) Environ Model Softw, 49, pp. 1-21; Riahi, K., Rao, S., Krey, V., Cho, C., Chirkov, V., Fischer, G., RCP 8.5-a scenario of comparatively high greenhouse gas emissions (2011) Climatic Change, 109, pp. 33-57; Masui, T., Matsumoto, K., Hijioka, Y., Kinoshita, T., Nozawa, T., Ishiwatari, S., An emission pathway for stabilization at 6 Wm-2 radiative forcing (2011) Climatic Change, 109, pp. 59-76; Thomson, A., Calvin, K., Smith, S., Kyle, P., Volke, A., Patel, P., RCP 4.5-a pathway for stabilization of radiative forcing by 2100 (2011) Climatic Change, 109, pp. 77-94; Vuuren, D., Stehfest, E., den Elzen, M., Kram, T., van Vliet, J., Deetman, S., RCP2.6: exploring the possibility to keep global mean temperature increase below 2 °C (2011) Climatic Change, 109, pp. 95-116; Harman, I., Ford, M., Jakeman, G., Phipps, S., Brede, M., Finnigan, J., (2008) Assessment of future global scenarios for the Garnaut Climate Change Review: an application of the GIAM framework, , CSIRO, Canberra; Gunasekera, D., Ford, M., Heyhoe, E., Gurney, A., Phipps, S.J., Harman, I., Global integrated assessment model: a new analytical tool for assessing climate change risks and policies (2008) Aust Commodities, 15 (1), pp. 195-216; Garnaut, R., (2011) The Garnaut review 2011: Australia in the global response to climate change, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Pant, H., (2007) GTEM: global trade and environment model.

Each set of heat exchangers is mounted such that it forms an array of a single, vertical row inside a low airflow wind tunnel. The tests are carried out under cross-flowing air velocity between 0.5 and 5.0 m/s at 0.5 m/s interval. The effects of foam thickness and transversal pitch distance are discussed and thermo-hydraulic results are benchmarking against those of a conventional finned tube array. It is found that within the designated range of airflow and the same level of compactness, the heat exchanger array with thicker foam layer enhances heat transfer 1.5 to 1.8 times compared with the one having thinner foam. In an array with fixed foam thickness, heat transfer improves at narrower pitches. At a discussion of the results, two empirical correlations to predict friction factor and thermal resistance are presented. ©2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Renewable hybrid system, which can explore solar or wind sources at low cost, is a popular choice for this purpose nowadays. In this paper optimal energy management for a grid-connected photovoltaic-battery hybrid system is proposed to sufficiently explore solar energy and to benefit customers at demand side. The management of power flow aims to minimize electricity cost subject to a number of constraints, such as power balance, solar output and battery capacity. With respect to demand side management, an optimal control method (open loop) is developed to schedule the power flow of hybrid system over 24. h, and model predictive control is used as a closed-loop method to dispatch the power flow in real-time when uncertain disturbances occur. In these two kinds of applications, optimal energy management solutions can be obtained with great cost savings and robust control performance. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Demand side management; Distributed generation;

However, the advancement of wind power generation is impeded by major challenges such as the cost of wind power, environmental impacts, and effects on power grid stability. One of the major environmental challenges hindering public acceptance for new wind power installations is the noise emission from wind turbines. Unfortunately, reducing the noise emission could lead to decreased wind energy harvesting. As a result of these conflicting goals, a tradeoff between power generation and noise emission arises.An optimal control approach for wind turbines is presented in this paper. By controlling the electromagnetic torque of the generator and/or the blade pitch angle, an optimal operating condition that considers the tradeoff between wind turbine energy harvesting and noise emission can be obtained. Simulations were conducted to analyze the impact of the control design on power generation and noise emission in partial and full-load conditions. Additionally, a case study for a wind farm located near a residential area operating in two different wind classes is detailed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Human exposure to wind turbine noise; Noise emission; Optimal control; Wind turbines","Wiser, R., Bolinger, M., Barbose, G., Darghouth, N., Hoen, B., Mills, A., Weaver, S., Wind technologies market report.

The increasing amount of renewable energy sources stresses this problem in several countries, where the responses in terms of reinforcement of transmission lines and ancillary services are not sufficiently fast or effective. In this study, we analyze the potential of a grid balancing system based on different combinations of traditional gas turbine based power plants with innovative 'power-to-gas' plants. Power-to-gas is a promising solution to balance the electric grid, based on water electrolysis, which can effectively contribute to reducing the uncertainty of dispatch plans. According to this system, the excess power produced by renewables is converted into hydrogen, which can be then injected into the natural gas grid. Different economic scenarios are assessed in this work, leading to a set of optimal sizes of the proposed system, using a statistical approach in order to estimate wind farm productivity and forecasting errors, as well as each component load conditions. Economic parameters, equivalent operating hours, CO2 emissions and lost wind energy are the main performances indexes considered in this work to compare gas turbine and electrolysis balancing systems. From an economic point of view, hybrid systems including both balancing technologies generally lead to the best performances. The scenario which leads to the highest power-to-gas capacity (with installed electrolysis power of about 6% of wind park nominal power) is determined coupling a mid-term perspective of reduction in investment costs with favorable energy market conditions or with incentives (""green-gas"" or carbon taxes). In such conditions, an equivalence between the two technologies in terms of optimum installed power can be reached at an electricity-to-natural gas cost ratio between 1.8 and 2. In most interesting scenarios, the P2G system brings about a lower total wind electricity injected in the grid, due to wind-to-gas energy conversion, while it allows reducing energy losses due to grid congestion and curtailment of the wind park; however, the additional CO2 emissions due to gas turbines operation and due to the reduced electricity production tend to offset or to limit the positive effect of the carbon-free gas production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Electrolysis; Energy storage; Green gas; Grid balancing; Power-to-gas; Wind power","Harnessing variable renewables: A guide to the balancing challenge (2011), p. 234. , Paris (France): OECD/IEA;Hohmeyer, O.H., Bohm, S., Trends toward 100% renewable electricity supply in Germany and Europe: a paradigm shift in energy policies (2015) Wiley Interdiscip Rev Energy Environ, 4 (1), pp. 74-97; ETP - Energy Technology Perspectives 2012 (2012), p. 690. , Paris (France): OECD/IEA;Denholm, P., Hand, M., Grid flexibility and storage required to achieve very high penetration of variable renewable electricity (2011) Energy Policy, 39 (3), pp. 1817-1830; Franco, A., Salza, P., Strategies for optimal penetration of intermittent renewables in complex energy systems based on techno-operational objectives (2011) Renew Energy, 36 (2), pp. 743-753; Balling, L., Flexible future for combined cycle, , Modern power systems Dec-2010; Balling, L., Fast cycling and rapid start-up: new generation of plants achieves impressive results Modern power systems Jan-2011DiCampli, J., Schulke, W., Grid stability: gas turbines for primary reserve, GT2013-94466 (2013) Proceedings of the ASME TurboExpo, , San Antonio, Texas (USA); June; Díaz-González, F., Sumper, A., A review of energy storage technologies for wind power applications (2012) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 16 (4), pp. 2154-2171; Beaudin, M., Zareipour, H., Schellenberglabe, A., Energy storage for mitigating the variability of renewable electricity sources: an updated review (2010) Energy Sustain Dev, 14 (4), pp. 302-314; Toledo, O.M., Oliveira Filho, D., Diniz, A.S.A.C., Distributed photovoltaic generation and energy storage systems: a review (2010) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 14 (1), pp. 506-511; http://www.energystorageexchange.org/projects, [accessed .08.14]Pearre, N.S., Swan, L.G., Technoeconomic feasibility of grid storage: mapping electrical services and energy storage technologies (2015) Appl Energy, 137, pp. 501-510; Boicea, V.A., Energy storage technologies: the past and the present (2014) Proc IEEE, 102 (11), pp. 1777-1794; Lako, P., Noord, M., Eder, H., Hydropower development with a focus on Asia and Western Europe (2013) Overview in the framework of VLEEM 2,"" ECN Policy Studies/Verbundplan, , https://www.ecn.nl/publications/BS/2003/ECN-C--03-027, Report ECN-C--03-027, [accessed .08.14]; Gimeno-Gutiérrez, M., Lacal-Arántegui, R., Assessment of the European potential for pumped hydropower energy storage potential (2013) JRC Scientific and policy reports, p. 74; (2012) Technology Roadmap - Hydropower, , Paris (France): OECD/IEA;; Crotogino, F., Mohmeyer, K-U., Scharf, R., Huntorf CAES: more than 20 years of successful operation (2001), Orlando, Florida (USA)http://www.peterbrotherhood.co.uk/literature/general/85164-10-CAES.pdf, [accessed .02.15]Stolten, D., Hydrogen for road transportation - a pathway to renewable energy.

Two modes of operation are used by this algorithm, the normal perturbation and observation mode and the predictive mode. The normal perturbation and observation mode with small step-size is switched under a slow wind speed variation to track the true maximum power point with fewer fluctuations in steady state. When a rapid change of wind speed is detected, the algorithm tracks the new maximum power point in two phases: in the first stage, the algorithm switches to the predictive mode in which the step-size is auto-adjusted according to the distance between the operating point and the estimated optimum point to move the operating point near to the maximum power point rapidly, and then the normal perturbation and observation mode is used to track the true peak power in the second stage. The dc-link voltage variation is used to detect rapid wind changes. The proposed algorithm does not require either knowledge of system parameters or of mechanical sensors. The experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm has a better performance in terms of dynamic response and efficiency compared with the conventional perturbation and observation algorithm. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

When the wind speed probability distribution is known, the wind energy distribution can easily be obtained. Therefore, the probability distribution of wind speed is a very important piece of information needed in the assessment of wind energy potential. For this reason, a large number of studies have been published concerning the use of a variety of probability density functions to describe wind speed frequency distributions. Two parameter Weibull distribution is widely used and accepted method. Artificial neural networks (ANN) can be used as an alternative to analytical approach as ANN offers advantages such as no required knowledge of internal system parameters, compact solution for multi-variable problems. In this investigation adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), which is a specific type of the ANN family, was used to predict the annual probability density distribution of wind speed. The simulation results presented in this paper show the effectiveness of the developed method. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive neuro-fuzzy system (ANFIS); Maximum likelihood method; Weibull distribution;

A 2-year (2012-2013) dataset from the meteorological mast of Cabauw (Netherlands) was used, including 10-min records collected at 10, 20, 40, and 80m. WT hub heights of 40 and 80m have been targeted for the extrapolation, being accomplished based on turbulence intensity observations at 10 and 20m. Trained over the year 2012, the method was validated over the year 2013.Good scores were returned both in wind speed and power density extrapolations, with biases within 7 and 8%, respectively. Wind speed extrapolation was better predicted 10-40m (NRMSE=0.16, r=0.95) than 10-80 and 20-80m (NRMSE=0.20-0.24, r=0.86-0.91), while for power density even finer scores than wind speed were achieved (. r=0.98 at 40m, and r=0.96 at 80m). Method's skills were also assessed in predicting wind energy yield. Application over sites with different terrain features and stability conditions is expected to provide further insight into its application field. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Atmospheric stability; Power law; Turbulence intensity; Wind energy yield; Wind shear coefficient","http://www.thewindpower.net, The wind turbines and wind farms database.

To evaluate wind energy properly and efficiently, this study proposes a hybrid forecasting approach that combines the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), which rarely presents in literature on wind speed forecasting, the Ljung-Box Q-test (LBQ) and the Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) to enhance the accuracy of wind speed forecasting. The proposed hybrid method is examined by forecasting the mean daily and mean monthly wind speed of four wind speed observation sites located in northwestern China. The results confirm that, compared with other popular models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Back-Propagation neural network (BP) and ELM), the hybrid forecasting method improves the predictions of daily and monthly wind speed, which indicates that the developed hybrid method exhibits stronger forecasting ability.

In this paper we develop a framework that allows us to consider the costs and benefits of a very simple strategy: curtailing (turning off) the turbines during high-risk periods for endangered species. We develop a model that allows us to find the lowest financial cost strategy (where cost is represented in dollars) for the curtailing operation, given a specific goal for bird mortality reduction. We apply the model to a specific case study: the proposed Cape Wind project and the vulnerability of the common loon (Gavia immer), during one month of the migratory season. We calculate probability distributions over energy produced, price, and revenue to the wind farm, as well as over the numbers of loon mortality, and perform an uncertainty analysis. As an example, we find that with the goal of reducing 10% of the expected bird deaths during the month of March, the cost per bird averages $170, using the most cost effective curtailment strategy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bird mortality; Environmental concerns; Optimization model; Wind energy","Band, W., Madders, M., Whitfield, D.P., Developing field and analytical methods to assess avian collision risk at wind farms (2007) Birds and wind farms: risk assessment and mitigation, pp. 259-275. , Madrid, Spain, 2007, M.

A large area of southern England (17,094km2) was assessed for suitability for wind and solar farm developments in three stages using geographic information systems. A multi-criteria decision making framework incorporating an analytical hierarchy process involving expert stakeholders was applied, which is a novel approach for this type of study. A binary constraint layer was created identifying entirely unsuitable locations. A factor layer was developed to indicate suitability in relation to a range of variables. Suitability layers for wind farm and solar farm development were then created covering the region. The environmental constraints used in the model accounted for over 60% of the study area for both wind and solar developments. Suitability for wind energy was generally low, with only 0.5km2 accounting for the 'most suitable' category. Solar suitability was higher overall; and a greater area (294km2) within the 'most suitable' category, suggesting the region is better suited for solar farm developments. Stakeholder input resulted in higher weightings for economic considerations for the solar model, prompting the most suitable areas to coincide with locations of the national grid connections. A sensitivity analysis indicated that model was generally reliable. This method can be used to assist appropriate site selection for onshore renewable energy projects across large geographical areas, helping to minimise their environmental impacts. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Analytical hierarchy process (AHP); Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM); Renewable energy; Suitability study; United Kingdom (UK)","Arent, D.J., Wise, A., Gelman, R., The status and prospects of renewable energy for combating global warming (2011) Energy Economics, 33, pp. 584-593; Aydin, N.Y., Kentel, E., Duzgun, H.S., GIS-based environmental assessment of wind energy systems for spatial planning: A case study from western Turkey (2010) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 14, pp. 364-373; Aydin, N.Y., Kentel, E., Duzgun, H.S., GIS-based site selection methodology for hybrid renewable energy systems: A case study from western Turkey (2013) Energy Conversion and Management, 70, pp. 90-106; Baban, S.M.J., Parry, T., Developing and applying a GIS-assisted approach to locating wind farms in the UK (2001) Renewable Energy, 24, pp. 59-71; Belton, V., Gear, T., On a shortcoming of Saaty's method of analytic hierarchy process (1983) Omega, 11, pp. 228-230; Chape, S., Harrison, J., Spalding, M., Lysenko, I., Measuring the extent and effectiveness of protected areas as an indicator for meeting global biodiversity targets (2005) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series B: Biological Sciences, 360, pp. 443-455; Charabi, Y., Gastil, A., PV site suitability analysis using GIS-based spatial fuzzy multi-criteria evaluation (2011) Renewable Energy, 36, pp. 2554-2561; Chiabrando, R., Fabrizio, G., Garnero, G., The territorial and landscape impacts of photovoltaic systems: Definition of impacts and assessment of glare risk (2009) Renewables and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 13, pp. 2441-2451; (2012) UK renewable energy roadmap update 2012, , https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/80246/11-02-13_UK_Renewable_Energy_Roadmap_Update_FINAL_DRAFT.pdf, DECC, Retrieved August 28, 2013 from; (2013) Solar energy central to renewables expansion: Press release 8th October 2013, , https-//www.gov.uk/government/news/solar-energy-central-to-renewables-expansion, DECC, Retrieved 31 January, 2014 from; (2013) Annual mean wind speed map, , https://restats.decc.gov.uk/cms/annual-mean-wind-speed-map, DECC, Retrieved 7 July, 2013 from; (2013) Restats-Renewables map, , http://restats.decc.gov.uk/app/pub/map/map/, DECC, Retrieved 2 July, 2013 from; (2014) Subsidies for solar farms to be cut to help safeguard farmland (Press Release, 19th October 2014), , https://www.gov.uk/government/news/subsidies-for-solar-farms-to-be-cut-to-help-safeguard-farmland, Defra (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, UK), Retrieved 2 November 2014 from; Dincer, I., Renewable energy and sustainable development: A crucial review (2000) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 4, pp. 157-175; Dyer, J.S., Remarks on the analytic hierarchy process (1990) Management Science, 36, pp. 249-258; European Union, Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC (2009) Official Journal of the European Union, , (L 140/16-60); Feick, R., Hall, G.B., A method for examining the spatial dimension of multi-criteria weight sensitivity (2004) International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 18 (8), pp. 815-840; Fthenakis, V., Kim, H.C., Land use and electricity generation: A life cycle analysis (2009) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 13, pp. 1465-1474; Grassi, S., Chokani, N., Anhari, R.S., Large scale technical and economical assessment of wind energy potential with a GIS tool: Case study Iowa (2012) Energy Policy, 45, pp. 73-85; Hansen, H.S., GIS-based multi-criteria analysis of wind farm development (2005) ScanGis 2005: Proceedings of the 10th Scandinavian research conference on geographical information science, pp. 75-87. , Department of Planning and Environment, Stockholm, Sweden, H.

In order to assess the economic viability of an investment in SWT, we analyze a set of scenarios that incorporate different types of SWT, various storage system options, support schemes, and specific urban surroundings for the case of Germany. As urban structures substantially influence local wind speeds, and hence the potential energy yield of a turbine, the location of SWT in the urban area is crucial for their economic feasibility. We find that SWT today are only profitable under very favorable conditions, the most important parameters being prevailing wind speeds and the location's degree of urbanization. In most cases, the coupling of the SWT to a storage system is crucial for cost-effectiveness. A feed-in tariff system specifically adapted to SWT technology is found to be an important driver of diffusion. Further research needs are identified in the field of long-term performance and yield projections for SWT. Based on the findings from our study, significant SWT diffusion can only be expected, if at all, in coastal suburban and rural areas. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy storage; Feed-in tariffs; Small wind turbine; Urban environment","(2013) Der Strommix in Deutschland im Jahr 2013, , http://www.unendlich-viel-energie.de/mediathek/grafiken/strommix-in-deutschland-2013, Agentur für Erneuerbare Energien (AfEE), Berlin, [last accessed January 17, 2015]; (2012) Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz (EEG), pp. 1634-1678. , Published in Bundesgesetzblatt Jahrgang 2011 Teil I Nr. 42; Mattes, A., Grüner Strom: Verbraucher sind bereit, für Investitionen in erneuerbare Energie zu zahlen (2012) DIW Wochenbericht, 7, pp. 2-9; (2012) 2013-Bestandteile, Entwicklung und Höhe, , Bundesverband Erneuerbare Energien e.V.

The proposed FD approach combines the use of analytical redundancy relations (ARRs) and interval observers. Interval observers consider an unknown but bounded description of the model parametric uncertainty and noise using the the so-called set-membership approach. This approach leads to formulate the fault detection test by means of checking if the measurements fall inside the estimated output interval, obtained from the mathematical model of the wind turbine and noise/parameter uncertainty bounds. Fault isolation is based on considering a set of ARRs obtained from the structural analysis of the wind turbine model and a fault signature matrix that considers the relation of ARRs and faults. The proposed FD approach has been validated on a 5-MW wind turbine using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory FAST simulator. The obtained results are presented and compared with that of other approaches proposed in the literature. © 2015 IEEE.","Analytical redundancy relations (ARRs); Interval-based observers; Model-based fault diagnosis (FD); Wind turbines","Walford, C., (2006) Wind Turbine Reliability: Understanding and Minimizing Wind Turbine Operation and Maintenance Costs, , Sandia Nat.

In this paper, a novel hybrid MCDM approach based on the fuzzy analytic network process (ANP), fuzzy decision making trail and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and fuzzy elimination and choice expressing the reality (ELECTRE) methodologies is applied to assist in the site selection of offshore wind farm (OWF) as the renewable energy in the IEP and the ICM frameworks. The aim of this study is to find the best site selection of offshore wind farm for four sites (alternatives) in Bandar Deylam on the Persian Gulf in southwest of Iran. Six criteria (depths and heights, environmental issues, proximity to facilities, economic aspects, resource technical levels and culture) and the related sub-criteria are considered to select proper sites for power station of OWF. The fuzzy ANP method is employed for standpoints of the site selection (goal) subject to the criteria and is performed the criteria subject to the sub-criteria. In addition, due to considering the influences of the criterion to another criterion, the fuzzy DEMATEL is employed in criteria and sub-criteria sections. Moreover, the fuzzy ELECTRE is applied to calculate the decision making matrices of sub-criteria to alternatives. The results show that the alternative A3 is the best site of OWF for Bandar Deylam. Then A2, A4 are the best alternatives and finally alternative A1 is the worst site. Also, a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the robustness of the outcomes of decision making by changing the priorities of the criteria. The results indicate the robustness of this method when the experts' opinions subject to the criteria change. The evaluation criteria and this methodology could be applied to other coastal cities for promoting the progress of ICM towards the goal of sustainability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Fuzzy ANP; Fuzzy DEMATEL; Fuzzy ELECTRE; Multi criteria decision making; Offshore wind farm","Arianejad, M., Safakish, M.S., (2009) Multi-criteria Decision Making, , Islamic Azad University Broujerd Branch and ToyserKan, (in Persian); Asgharpour, M.J., (2011) Multiple Criteria Decision Making, , Tehran University Press, (in Persian); Awan, A.G., Relationship between environment and sustainable economic development: a theoretical approach to environmental problems (2013) Int.

In order to minimize the damage of offshore wind turbines caused by ship impact, a crashworthy device, which contains a rubber blanket and outer steel shell, is proposed. The rubber hardness and the rubber and steel shell thicknesses of the crashworthy device are optimized by comparing the collision-force and nacelle acceleration using LS-DYNA explicit code. The main reason for lessening the maximum collision-force and nacelle acceleration is that the rubber blanket could absorb a portion of ship energy by using its own structure deformation. Therefore, an optimal crashworthy device for the monopile offshore wind turbine, meeting the weight constraint, is suggested and implemented in various impact scenarios. The obvious effects of crashworthy devices are a decrease of the maximum collision-force and nacelle acceleration, especially for ships with smaller initial kinetic energy. The damage area of plastic strain for foundations is reduced to zero when crashworthy devices are used in the analysis scenarios.

It is widely accepted that for long distances HVDC links are preferred over HVAC transmission. Accordingly, one possible approach might be to consider not only a DC transmission system but also for the WPP collection grid. In this paper, a technical and economic comparison analysis of the conventional AC OWPP scheme and four proposed DC OWPPs topologies is addressed. Due to the conceptual novelty of DC technologies for OWPPs, uncertainty on electrical parameters and cost functions is relevant. A sensitivity analysis of the cost and efficiency of the components, OWPP rated power, export cable lengths and some economic data is carried out. For this study, a methodology is proposed and implemented in DIgSILENT Power Factory®. To compare conventional AC offshore collector grid and the various proposed DC configurations, an OWPP based on Horn's Rev wind farm is selected as base case. The analysis of the results shows that, in general terms, DC OWPPs present capital costs comparable with conventional AC OWPPs, as well as lower energy losses, concluding that DC collector grid could be of interest for future OWPP installations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Collector grid; DC technology; Economic analysis; Offshore wind power plants; Sensitivity analysis","Wilkes, J., Moccia, J., (2013) Wind in power: 2012 European statistics, , EWEA, Tech.

For this reason, there exists a need to asses whether wind turbines (WTs) will comply with such functionalities to ensure power system stability. This paper demonstrates that Type-2 WTs may induce sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) events when connected to a series-compensated transmission line, and with proper control, they may also suppress such events. The paper presents a complete dynamic model tailored to study, via eigenanalysis, SSR events in the presence of Type-2 WTs, and a systematic procedure to design a power system stabilizer using only local and measurable signals.

The features of the proposed topology, as compared with the existing piezoelectric/electromagnetic topologies, are as follows: 1) delivering power at high voltage levels, particularly at low-speed air flows; 2) starting operation at low cut-in speeds (about 1 m/s); and 3) robust structure for operating at high-speed wind flows practically tested up to 20 m/s. The proposed topology consists of a small fan with embedded permanent magnets (PMs) and a piezoelectric beam with a PM proof mass, which interacts with the PMs in the fan to harvest wind power. This paper also presents an analytical model and a design procedure to determine the number of PMs in the fan and their arrangements to maximize the captured power and minimize the cut-in speed. Using a prototype of the proposed topology, it is shown that the device starts capturing wind power at the wind speeds above 0.9 m/s. It is also shown that the suggested topology is at least 10% more efficient than the existing topologies in using piezoelectric materials and that its total volume power density is higher than those of the other topologies. © 2014 IEEE.","Piezoelectric energy harvesting; self-powered devices; small-scale wind energy harvesting; smart monitoring; wind energy; wireless sensor nodes","Khaligh, A., Zeng, P., Zheng, C., Kinetic energy harvesting using piezoelectric and electromagnetic technologies-State of the art (2010) IEEE Trans.

However, there are a number of challenges in offshore; wind turbines are subject to different loads that are not often experienced onshore and more importantly challenging wind and wave conditions limit the operability of the vessels needed to access offshore wind farms. As the power generation capacity improves constantly, advanced planning of Operation and Maintenance (O&M) activities, which supports the developers in achieving reduced downtime, optimised availability and maximised revenue, has gained vital importance. In this context, the focus of this research is the investigation of the most cost-effective approach to allocate O&M resources which may include helicopter, crew transfer vessels, offshore access vessels, and jack-up vessels. This target is achieved through the implementation of a time domain Monte-Carlo simulation approach which includes analysis of environmental conditions (wind speed, wave height, and wave period), operational analysis of transportation systems, investigation of failures (type and frequency), and simulation of repairs. The developed methodology highlights how the O&M fleets can be operated in a cost-effective manner in order to support associated day-to-day O&M activities and sustain continuous power production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, direct-driven generators of traditional technology are very difficult to be scaled up to a rated power of 10 MW or above. Superconducting generators offer a candidate to fill that gap. A feasible superconducting wind generator topology has rotor field windings made of superconductors and traditional copper stator windings carrying alterative currents. Nowadays, two kinds of superconductors are available in the market: the low-temperature superconductors (LTS) and the high-temperature superconductors (HTS). They have great differences in terms of material characteristics, product performance, price, and the relevant cryogenic and refrigeration system, which have a great influence on the design of superconducting generators. In this paper, a comparison study of superconducting wind generators with HTS and LTS rotor field windings is carried out, considering the performance and cost of superconductors and the cryogenic and refrigeration system. From the viewpoint of initial capital, technology maturity, and engineering feasibility, the LTS wind generator is recommended for subscale or full-sized prototype development in the near future. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","high temperature superconductor; low temperature superconductor; offshore wind generation; rotor field winding; superconducting generator","Lloberas, J., Sumper, A., Sanmarti, M., Granados, X., A review of high temperature superconductors for offshore wind power synchronous generators (2014) Renew.

We propose a method to characterize wind variability and to estimate wind potential in coastal areas where appropriate meteorological measurements may not be available. A gridded reanalysis wind product (BMW-CERSAT), which provides data of zonal and meridional components of wind with a resolution of 1/4°(~25km) from years 2004-2009, is used as the reference wind field after a statistical comparison to near-surface observations. Mean wind intensity field at 50-m height and its corresponding mean power density are modeled by using the Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program (WAsP). The wind power potential of the southern half of Tamaulipas State is classified as poor (200-300Wm-2), becoming marginal in some areas near the coast. Only the northern half of the State is classified with moderate potential (400-500Wm-2), while the lagoon zone has good potential. Estimates, however, could be 30-50% higher if wind observations are measured at a higher frequency. Results show that the wind potential along Tamaulipas is lower than that suggested by the official prevailing eolic-potential map in Mexico. We conclude that even if the assessment presented in this work is preliminary, it gives a realistic approximation of wind as a promising renewable source for electric generation along the coast of Tamaulipas. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Northeastern Mexico; Reanalysis wind product; Tamaulipas State; Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program; Wind power potential","Kumar, A., Nair, K., Wind power potential at Benau, Savusavu, Vanua Levu, Fiji (2013) Int J Energy Inf Commun, 4, pp. 51-62; Jimenez, B., Durante, F., Lange, B., Kreutzer, T., Tambke, J., Offshore wind resource assessment with WAsP and MM5: comparative study for the German Bight (2007) Wind Energy, 10, pp. 121-134; Schwartz, M.N., Elliott, D.L., (1995) Mexico wind resource assessment project, , DOE/NREL Report No. DE95009202, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden Colorado; Aiello, J.L., Valencia, J.I., Muñoz, E.C., Gómez, V.L., (1983) Atlas Eólico Preliminar De América Latina y el Caribe, 1. , Organización Latinoamericana de Energía, Cuernavaca, Mexico; Saldaña, R., Miranda, U., (2005) Estudio de los Potenciales Bioenergético, Eólico, Minihidráulico y Solar en México, , http://www.energia.gob.mx/webSener/res/-168/A9_Recursos.pdf, Public report available from:, [February 2012]; Miranda, U., Saldaña, R., Evaluación del Potencial Eólico en México Empleando ArcGis y WAsP (2006) XIII Conferencia Latinoamericana de Usuarios ESRI y Leica Geosystems, , http://evaluarer.iie.org.mx/genc/evaluarer/siger/doc/Articulo_SIG_-viento.pdf, Public paper available from:, [April 2012]; (2011) Explorador de Recursos Renovables del Instituto de Investigaciones Eléctricas, , http://sag01.iie.org.mx/eolicosolar/Default.aspx, Available from:, [April 2012]; Quiroga-Goode, G., (2007) Evaluación del potencial eólico en el puerto de Altamira con la base datos FTS 20032006, , Internal report, API-Altamira, Mexico; Quiroga-Goode, G., Montante, O.S., Rodríguez, J., Lambert, T., Marginal winds leading to competitive rates: a case study in southern Tamaulipas (2011) Wind Energy, 35, pp. 11-126; Bentamy, A., Ayina, H.-L., Queffeulou, P., Croize-Fillon, D., Kerbaol, V., Improved near real time surface wind resolution over the Mediterranean Sea (2007) Ocean Sci, 3, pp. 259-271; Mesinger, F., DiMego, G., Kalnay, E., Mitchell, K., Shafran, P.C., Ebisuzaki, W., North American regional reanalysis (2006) Bull Am Meteor Soc, 87, pp. 343-360; Troen, I., Petersen, E.L., (1989) European wind atlas, , Risø National Laboratory, Roskilde, Denmark; Holton, J.R., (1979) An introduction to dynamic meteorology, , Academic Press, New York, United States; Weibull, W., Astatistical distribution function of wide applicability (1951) JAppl Mech Trans ASME, 18, pp. 293-297; Troen, I., Mortensen, N., Petersen, E.L., (1988) WASP - wind atlas analysis and application programme, user's guide, , Risø National Laboratory Pub., Roskilde, Denmark; Petersen, E., Mortensen, N.G., Landberg, L., Højstrup, J., Frank, H., (1997) Wind power meteorology, Risø-I-1206, , Risø National Laboratory, Roskilde, Denmark; Gutiérrez de Velasco, G., Winant, C.D., Seasonal patterns of wind stress and wind stress curl over the Gulf of Mexico (1996) JGeophys Res, 101, pp. 18127-18140; Carrasco-Díaz, M., Roque-Rodríguez, A., Sanchez-Montante, O., Rivas, D., Local breeze effects on wind energy wind generation in the northern coast of Cuba (2011) Wind Energy, 35, pp. 635-648; Moreno, C., Martínez, J., Leiva, G., Roque, A., Novo, R., Costa, A., (2007) Diez preguntas y respuestas sobre Energía Eólica, , Editorial CUBASOLAR, La Habana, Cuba; Gunturu, U.B., Schlosser, C.A., Characterization of wind power resource in the United States (2012) Atmos Chem Phys, 12, pp. 9687-9702; (2009) Acta de la octava sesión del 2009 del Comité de Información de la Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), 2009, , http://www.cfe.gob.mx/QuienesSomos/queEsCFE/Documents/Actasdelcomit%C3%A92009/Octava%20Sesi%C3%B3n%202009.pdf, Available from:, [May 2012]; (2012) Datos técnicos de las principales centrales de CFE en operación en 2011, , http://www.sener.gob.mx/res/PE_y_DT/ee/Datos_Tecnicos_de_las_principales_Centrales_en_Operacion_de_CFE.pdf, Available from:, [April 2012]; (2012) Costo de Generación por Tecnología, , http://www.cfe.gob.mx/QuienesSomos/queEsCFE/%20Documents/2012/Administracion/Costodegeneracionportecnologia2002_2011.pdf, Available from:, Comisin Federal de Electricidad, [May 2012]; Smith, W.H.F., Sandwell, D.T., Global sea floor topography from satellite altimetry and ship depth soundings (1997) Science, 277, pp. 1956-1962",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921801751

In this particular study, the power system consists of a power electronic converter supplied by a battery bank, which is used to form the ac grid (grid former converter), an energy source based on a wind turbine with its respective power electronic converter (grid supplier converter), and the power consumers (loads). The main objective of this proposed strategy is to control the state of charge of the battery bank limiting the voltage on its terminals by controlling the power generated by the energy sources. This is done without using dump loads or any physical communication among the power electronic converters or the individual energy source controllers. The electrical frequency of the microgrid is used to inform the power sources and their respective converters about the amount of power that they need to generate in order to maintain the battery-bank charging voltage below or equal its maximum allowable limit. Experimental results are presented to show the feasibility of the proposed control strategy. © 2014 IEEE.","Battery banks; isolated microgrids; parallel inverters; power control; renewable energy sources; state of charge","Ribeiro, L.A.S., Saavedra, O.R., De Lima, S.L., De Matos, J.G., Isolated micro-grid with renewable hybrid generation: The case of Lençóis island (2011) IEEE Trans.

For the energy assessment an evaluation of the spatial distribution of wave power is done and, since Galway Bay is a quarter scale test site for wave energy devices, statistical results were presented for three years of data, providing statistics of the expected wave energy resource in the Bay. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Galway Bay; Numerical models; SWAN; Wave energy; WAVEWATCH III","Clément, A., McCullen, P., Falcão, A., Fiorentino, A., Gardner, F., Hammarlund, K., Wave energy in Europe: current status and perspectives (2002) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 6, pp. 405-431; (2002) Options for the development of wave energy in Ireland, , NDP; Guedes Soares, C., Bhattacharjee, J., Tello, M., Pietra, L., Review and classification of wave energy converters (2012) Maritime engineering and technology, pp. 585-594. , Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK, C.

We use the same model and data, based loosely on California in 2030, to evaluate several options to stem the decline in value of these technologies. The largest increase in the value of wind at high penetration levels comes from increased geographic diversity. The largest increase in the value of PV at high penetration levels comes from assuming that low-cost bulk power storage is an investment option. Other attractive options, particularly at more modest penetration levels, include real-time pricing and technology diversity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Economic valuation; Real-time pricing; Renewable integration; Storage","Sullivan, P., Eurek, K., Margolis, R., Advanced methods for incorporating solar energy technologies into electric sector capacity-expansion models: literature review and analysis, , http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/61185.pdf, Tech.

Offshore wind farms may pose direct risks to seabirds at protected breeding sites. However, changes in food availability may influence foraging behaviour and habitat use during the breeding season or between years. Consequently, seabird-wind farm interactions, and risks posed to populations, may vary over longer time scales, but this has seldom been quantified. We used GPS-telemetry to study the movements of 25 lesser black-backed gulls from the Alde-Ore Special Protection Area (SPA), UK between 2010 and 2012, while birds were associated with their breeding colony. Variation in movements away from the colony, offshore, and in operational, consented and proposed Offshore Wind Farm Areas (""OWFAs"") was investigated: (1) between years and (2) across the breeding season, addressing: (3) sex-specific, (4) individual and (5) diurnal/nocturnal differences. The extent of overlaps with OWFAs varied between years, being greatest in 2010 (7/10 birds showing connectivity; area overlap: 6.2. ±. 7.1%; time budget overlap: 4.6. ±. 6.2%) and least in 2012. Marine habitats close to the colony were used before breeding. Birds spent little time offshore as incubation commenced, but offshore usage again peaked during the early chick-rearing period, corresponding with use of OWFAs. Individuals differed in their seasonal interactions with OWFAs between years, and males used OWFAs significantly more than females later in the breeding season. This study demonstrates the importance of tracking animals over longer periods, without which impact assessments may incorrectly estimate the magnitude of risks posed to protected populations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Collision risk; Connectivity; Foraging behaviour; GPS tracking; Renewable energy development","(2015), http://www.4coffshore.com/offshorewind/, 4cOffshoreWind (accessed 25.02.15)Annett, C.A., Pierotti, R., Chick hatching as a trigger for dietary switching in the Western Gull (1989) Colonial Waterbirds, 12, pp. 4-11; Bearhop, S., Thompson, D.R., Phillips, R.A., Waldron, S., Hamer, K.C., Gray, C.M., Votier, S.C., Furness, R.W., Annual variation in Great Skua diets: the importance of commercial fisheries and predation on seabirds revealed by combining dietary analyses (2001) Condor, 103, pp. 802-809; Bogdanova, M.I., Wanless, S., Harris, M.P., Lindström, J., Butler, A., Newell, M.A., Sato, K., Daunt, F., Among-year and within-population variation in foraging distribution of European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis over two decades: implications for marine spatial planning (2014) Biol.

This technology utilizes (surplus) electricity from renewable power sources to produce hydrogen in an electrolyzer. The produced hydrogen can be either directly utilized as an energy carrier or combined with CO<inf>2</inf> and further converted to methane. This article evaluates different CO<inf>2</inf> sources concerning their potential utilization within the power-to-gas energy storage technology with regard to capture costs, specific energy requirement and CO<inf>2</inf> penalties. The results of a case study for Austria indicate that there is enough CO<inf>2</inf> available from point sources to store all of the electricity produced from fluctuating renewable power sources (wind power plants and photovoltaics) via power-to-gas. Due to low capture costs, low CO<inf>2</inf> penalties, biogenic origins, and short distances to wind power plants, biogas upgrading facilities and a bioethanol plant were determined to be the CO<inf>2</inf> sources best suited for utilization in novel power-to-gas plants. However, as the total amount of CO<inf>2</inf> produced from these facilities is relatively low in Austria, other CO<inf>2</inf> sources would also be required. With moderate capture costs and CO<inf>2</inf> penalties, power plants and an existing refinery could also provide CO<inf>2</inf> for power-to-gas. Although large amounts of CO<inf>2</inf> are available from iron, steel, and cement production facilities, these sources are not recommended for CO<inf>2</inf> utilization in power-to-gas, as the CO<inf>2</inf> penalty is relatively high and the facilities are rarely located near wind power plants in Austria. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",,"Graves, C., Ebbesen, S.D., Mogensen, M., Lackner, K.S., (2011) Renew.

It has been reported that this modular pancake structure provides excellent mechanical holding, effective cooling, and high magnetic flux density for stability of the superconducting coil. However, soldering for interconnecting each double pancake causes current decay, cryogenic coolant loss, and thermal stress. Thus, this paper investigates an improved double pancake winding, named the ""jointless double pancake coil winding"" and demonstrates the efficacy for minimizing the electrical loss of the high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coil, assembled in the modular double pancake types. It presents a winding method that avoids soldering between the pancake connections and thus removes the primary cause of the electrical loss generated in the existing design. This proposed winding method can effectively achieve zero electrical loss. This paper particularly presents the application of the proposed winding for the HTS-SMES and demonstrates the feasibility and improved functional benefits with reference to the conventional coil. This paper should maximize the operational benefits of using the SMES coil employing the proposed winding method in charge and discharge operations and should increase the effectiveness and efficiency in cryogenic systems. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","energy loss; High temperature superconductors; joints; superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES); wind power; windings, superconducting coils","Song, H., 2G HTS coil technology development SuperPower (2013) IEEE Trans.

In this paper, a numerical simulation on the wind turbine S825 airfoil is conducted with k-ω turbulence model at different attack angles. By comparing with experimental data, a new method of modifying k-ω model is proposed. A modifying function is proposed to limit the production term in ω equation based on fluid rotation and deformation. This method improves turbulent viscosity and decreases separating region when the airfoil works at large separating conditions. The predictive accuracy could be improved by using the modified k-ω turbulence model. © 2015, Science Press, Institute of Engineering Thermophysics, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","aerodynamic performance; k-ω model; non-equilibrium; S825 airfoil; separation","Li, Q., Maeda, T., Kamada, Y., Analysis of Aerodynamic Load on Straight-bladed Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (2014) Journal of Thermal Science, 23 (4), pp. 315-324; Tangler, J.L., The Nebulous Art of Using Wind-Tunnel Airfoil Data for Predicting Rotor Performance (2002) Wind Energy, 5, pp. 245-257; Ribeiro, A.F.P., Awruch, A.M., Gomes, H.M., An airfoil optimization technique for wind turbines (2012) Applied Mathematical Modelling, 36 (10), pp. 4898-4907; Gross, A., Fasel, H.F., Flow Control for NREL S822 Wind Turbine Airfoil (2012) AIAA Journal, 50 (12), pp. 2779-2790; Liu, Y., Sun, J., Lu, L., Corner Separation Control by Boundary Layer Suction Applied to a Highly Loaded Axial Compressor Cascade (2014) Energies, 7, pp. 7994-8007; Smirnov, P.E., Menter, F.R., Sensitization of the SST Turbulence Model to Rotation and Curvature by Applying the Spalart-Shur Correction Term (2009) Journal of Turbomachinery; Sanderse, B., van der Pijl, S.P., Koren, B., Review of computational fluid dynamics for wind turbine wake aerodynamics (2011) Wind Energy, 14 (7), pp. 799-819; Liu, B., Zhang, B., Liu, Y., Investigation of model development for deterministic correlations associated with impeller-diffuser interactions in centrifugal compressors (2015) Science China Technological Sciences, 58 (3), pp. 499-509; Liu, Y., Liu, B., Lu, L., Study of modeling unsteady blade row interaction in a transonic compressor stage Part 1: Code development and deterministic correlation analysis (2012) Acta Mechanica Sinica, 28 (2), pp. 281-290; Liu, Y., Liu, B., Lu, L., Study of modeling unsteady blade row interaction in a transonic compressor stage Part 2: Influence of deterministic correlations on time-averaged flow prediction (2012) Acta Mechanica Sinica, 28 (2), pp. 291-299; Liu, B., Zhang, B., Liu, Y., Numerical investigations of impeller-diffuser interactions in a transonic centrifugal compressor stage using nonlinear harmonic method (2014) Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers Part A-Journal of Power and Energy, 228 (8), pp. 862-877; Liu, Y., Lu, L., Fang, L., Modification of Spalart-Allmaras model with consideration of turbulence energy backscatter using velocity helicity (2011) Physics Letters A, 375 (24), pp. 2377-2381; Liu, Y., Yu, X., Liu, B., Turbulence models assessment for large-scale tip vortices in an axial compressor rotor (2008) Journal of Propulsion and Power, 24 (1), pp. 15-25; Spalart, P.R., Shur, M., On the Sensitization of Turbulence Models to Rotation and Curvature (1997) Aerospace Science and Technology, pp. 297-302; Hellsten, A., Some Improvements in Menter's k-omega SST Turbulence Model (1998) 29th AIAA Fluid Dynamics Conference; Kok, J.C., Resolving the dependence on freestream values for the k-omega turbulence model (2000) AIAA Journal, 38 (7), pp. 1292-1295; Rung, T., Bunge, U., Schatz, M., Restatement of the Spalart-Allmaras eddy-viscosity model in strain-adaptive formulation (2003) AIAA Journal, 41 (7), pp. 1396-1399; Somers, D.M., (2005) Design and experimental results for the S825 Airfoil; Wilcox, D.C., (2006) Turbulence Modeling for CFD, pp. 124-128; Truesdell, C., (1954) The Kinematics of Vorticity, pp. 106-108",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928998943

The major objective of this undertaking is to enable the deployment of cost effective direct drive HTS generators for large off-shore wind turbines. The improved conductor performance allows for a significant reduction of the length of HTS tapes required to generate the excitation field and thus to a reduction of the overall generator cost. This paper presents design and optimization work to find the best generator topology based on the 4X conductor to minimize the levelized cost of energy. The electromagnetic model uses the commercial package FlexPDE as the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) solver. The model takes the power and RPM requirements as inputs, and outputs the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for the turbine. The model estimates the actual mass and cost of the generator assuming mass production of multiple units per year. The paper presents the model developed in detail as well as the results obtained from the analysis through Monte-Carlo design space exploration. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","Finite Element Analysis; High Temperature Superconductivity; Levelized Cost of Electricity; Wind turbine generators","Tao, H.Y.S., Srivastava, A.K., Pineda, R.L., Mandal, P., Wind power generation impact on electricity price in ERCOT Proc.

The hydrodynamic pressure exerted on the structure by the ocean water, modeled as compressible non-viscous ideal fluid, is calculated taking into account the fluid-structure interaction, the energy absorption by the seabed, and the energy radiation into infinity. From the hydrodynamic pressure, the added mass and the effective load, resulting from the hydrodynamic pressure, are obtained. They are combined with the finite element model of the structure, resulting in a numerical model for the entire coupled system. For validation of the numerical model, the hydrodynamic pressures induced by the vertical motion of the seabed at free field, and due to the vertical vibration of a floating massless rigid disk, are calculated and compared with exact analytical solutions. The developed method is applied to seismic analysis of a simplified support structure for floating offshore wind turbines subjected to the hydrodynamic pressures induced from seaquakes. Analysis results show that dynamic response of a floating offshore structure induced by the vertical seismic motion of the ocean bed can be greatly influenced by the compressibility of sea water and the energy absorption capacity of the seabed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Deep reductions in emissions require a focus not just on energy and mitigation policy but on factors underlying this development. The Kaya identity has been recommended to track national progress with respect to sustainability and carbon emissions in the development path. This study applies an extended Kaya identity to the energy-related carbon emissions of Spain. Implemented through a divisia index decomposition annually from 1990 to 2011, it highlights the impact of factors such as affluence and energy intensity. A marked departure from previous studies is the separation of the effects of the carbon-free energy sources; both renewables and nuclear as fundamental mitigation measures. The results show that affluence and population have acted to increase emissions and energy intensity was increasing until recent years. Fuel substitution has acted to decrease emissions but while renewable energy has reduced emissions with the increasing importance of biomass, wind and solar, the decline in share of nuclear has acted to increase emissions. Implications for the development path and policy are discussed and lessons are relevant both for industrialised and industrialising nations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon emissions; Decomposition analysis; Development path; Nuclear; Renewables; Spain","(2012) Resumen Annual de Climatológico, , http://www.aemet.es/documentos/es/serviciosclimaticos/vigilancia_clima/resumenes_climat/anuales/res_anual_clim_2011.pdf, Agencia Estatal de Meteorologia (accessed 08.01.14); Alcántara, V., Roca, J., Energy and CO2 emissions in Spain methodology of analysis and some results for 1980-90 (1995) Energy Econ., 17 (3), pp. 221-230; Alcántara, V., Padilla, E., Input-output subsystems and pollution: an application to the service sector and CO2 emissions in Spain (2009) Ecol.

It is found that the main structures and characteristics are the same as during strong wind episodes with cold air outbreaks on land. The high frequency turbulent fluctuations (period <1 min) are nearly random and isotropic with weak coherency, but the gusty wind disturbances (1 min<period <10 min) are anisotropic with rather strong coherency. However, in the windy atmospheric boundary layer at sea, compared with that over land, there are some pronounced differences: (1) the average horizontal speed is almost independent of height, and the vertical velocity is positive in the lower marine atmospheric boundary layer; (2) the vertical flux of horizontal momentum is nearly independent of height in the low layer indicating the existence of a constant flux layer, unlike during strong wind over the land surface; (3) the kinetic energy and friction velocity of turbulent fluctuations are larger than those of gusty disturbances; (4) due to the independence of horizontal speed to height, the horizontal speed itself (not its vertical gradient used over the land surface) can be used as the key parameter to parameterize the turbulent and gusty characteristics with high accuracy. © 2015, Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","coherent structure; cold surge; turbulence; wind gust; windy marine atmospheric boundary layer","Andreas, E.L., Sea spray and the turbulent air-sea heat fluxes (1992) J.

This study presents a numerical simulation calculating convection and radiation heat losses from four different receiver shapes including external and cavity type receivers with different opening ratios (ratio of cavity aperture area to receiver area). The simulation was carried out using Fluent CFD (computational fluid dynamics) software considering three different receiver temperatures (600, 750, and 900. °C), three wind velocities (1, 5, and 10. m/s), and two wind directions (head-on and side-on). The simulation results were then used for deriving a simplified correlation model which gives the fraction of convection heat loss by a function of opening ratio, receiver temperature, and wind velocity. The calculated fraction can be easily converted to convection heat loss, total heat loss, or receiver efficiency once the radiation heat loss is estimated by any applicable prediction model. Calculated heat loses by the proposed simple correlation model showed good agreements with the simulation results with 11.4% and 5.9% average absolute deviations for convection heat loss and total heat loss, respectively. Validation of the model with experimental data was also carried out using test results available from three central receiver systems (Martin Marietta, Solar One and Solar Two). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Central tower; Convection; Efficiency; Heat loss; Radiation; Solar receiver","Boehm, R.F., A review of convection loss data from solar central receivers (1987) J.

Many methods were proposed in the literature for finding best locations for DG placement considering various criteria. Sometime, it becomes difficult for combined placement of different kinds of renewable based DGs, such as solar, wind and fuel cell. The criterion of minimizing total system cost was used previously by many researchers for locating the optimal sites for DGs using OPF formulations. In this case, three different cost functions are formulated for different kinds of renewable energy sources (RESs). By taking combined cost function of all the RESs in the OPF to identify location for each different kind of sources becomes very cumbersome task. It would be difficult to find the exact locations for various kinds of RESs that is where to place which type of RESs. In order to solve this difficulty, three different objectives have been considered separately for determining the optimal locations for each kind of RESs using mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) method considering loadability, losses and cost. Having many alternatives with these three objectives, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) has been used to make a decision over getting the optimal locations for these different kinds of RESs. The proposed methodology has been demonstrated on 15-node radial distribution system and 69-node mesh distribution system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Analytical hierarchical process; Distributed generation; Mixed-integer non-linear programming; Optimal power flow; Renewable energy sources","Kemp, R., (1997) Environmental policy and technical change, pp. 290-311. , Edward Elgar, UK; Rau, N.S., Wan, Y.H., Optimum location of resources in distributed planning (1994) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 9, pp. 2014-2020; Keane, A., O'Malley, M., Optimal allocation of embedded generation on distribution networks (2005) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 20, pp. 1640-1646; Pisică, I., Bulac, C., Eremia, M., Optimal distributed generation location and sizing using genetic algorithms (2009) Proceeding of the 15th International Conference on Intelligent System Application to Power System (ISAP 2009), , Curitiba, Brazil; Gautam, D., Mithulananthan, N., Optimal DG placement in deregulated electricity market (2007) Elect Power Syst Res, 77, pp. 1627-1636; Singh, R.K., Goswami, S., Optimum allocation of distributed generation based on nodal pricing for profit, loss reduction, and voltage improvement including voltage rise issue (2010) Elect Power Syst Res, 36, pp. 637-644; Borges, C.L.T., Falcao, D.M., Optimal distributed generation allocation for reliability losses and voltage improvement (2006) Int J Elect Power Energy Syst, 28, pp. 413-420; Nara, K., Hayashi, Y., Ikeda, K., Ashizawa, T., Application of tabu search to optimal placement of distributed generators (2001) IEEE PES Winter Meeting, pp. 918-923; Bompard, E., Napoli, R., Wan, B., Orsello, G., Economics evaluation of a 5kW SOFC power system for residential use (2008) Hydrogen Energy, 33, pp. 3243-3247; Agalgaonkar, A.P., Kulkarni, S.V., Khaparde, S.A., Multi-attribute decision making approach for strategic planning of DGs (2005) IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, pp. 2985-2990; Sahraei-Ardakani, M., Peydayesh, M., Rahimi-Kian, A., Multi-Attribute optimal DG planning under uncertainty using AHP method (2008) Proceedings of the IEEE-PES GM, 2008, , Pittsburg, PA, USA; Pan, J., Teklu, Y., Rahman, S., de Castro, A., An interval-based MADM approach to the identification of candidate alternatives in strategic resources planning (2000) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 15, pp. 1441-1446; Yoon, K., Kim, G., Multiple attribute decision analysis with imprecise information (1989) IIE Trans, 21, pp. 21-25; (1998) A user's guide, , GAMS Software; Ashokkumar, R., Aravindhababu, P., An improved power flow technique for distribution systems (2009) J Comp Sci Inform Elect Eng, 3. , 185; Baran, M.E., Wu, F.F., Optimal capacitor placement on radial distribution systems (1989) IEEE Trans Power Del, 4, pp. 725-734; Masters, G.M., (2004) Renewable and efficient electric power systems, , John Wiley & Sons, New Jersey, USA; Fingersh, L., Hand, M., Laxson, A., (2006) Wind turbine design cost and scaling model, , National Renewable Energy Laboratory Report",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922325984

P2G systems require both a supply of green electricity and a source of CO2. Cheap electricity is essential for a financially sustainable P2G system. Using a PLEXOS model it was determined that deploying 50MWe of P2G capacity on the 2030 Irish electrical grid may reduce absolute levels of curtailed wind by 5% compared to the base case. CO2 capture is expensive. The cheapest method of sourcing CO2 for a P2G system is to employ a methanation process whereby biogas from anaerobic digestion is mixed with hydrogen from surplus electricity. Anaerobic digestion in Ireland has a potential to produce biomethane to a level of 10.2% of energy in transport (19.2PJ/a). The potential CO2 resource from anaerobic digestion could allow for a further 8.9% of energy in transport (16.6PJ/a) from P2G production. An optimal model is proposed including for co-location of a biogas system with a P2G system. The model includes for demand-driven biogas concepts allowing electrical grid balancing and the supply of gaseous transportation fuel.

The innovation of the LARS is the combination of the analysis of the acoustic signals and the force excitation. Generic plates of a standardized material (Vetronit EGS 619) and segments of rotor blades of wind turbines were tested. The generic specimens, 2 and 6 mm in thickness, were damaged with various impact energies caused by a spherical impactor with a diameter of 16 mm, which generated impact damages ranging from barely visible to clearly visible on the generic specimen as well as on segments of real rotorblades of windturbines. The impacts have been measured to account for damage diameter, form and area, indentation depth and bulge height. In addition, blind holes of different depths have been drilled to assess the depth of penetration of the methods tested. As observed in scientific literature as well as in current research, impact damages exhibit a peanut-shaped damage area when impacted with minimum threshold energy. The current research tested several of the specimens using X-ray computed tomography as a reference measurement. These results were compared to the data obtained by ultrasonic methods, LARS and optical lock-in thermography. Finally, all methods have been applied to evaluate rotor blades of wind turbines.

While models based on this simplified geometry provide only approximations to the true processes of instability-driven mass and angular momentum transport, their simplicity makes them invaluable tools for both semi-analytic modeling and simulations of long-term evolution where two- or three-dimensional calculations are too computationally costly. Despite the utility of these models, the only publicly-available frameworks for simulating them are rather specialized and non-general. Here we describe a highly flexible, general numerical method for simulating viscous thin disks with arbitrary rotation curves, viscosities, boundary conditions, grid spacings, equations of state, and rates of gain or loss of mass (e.g., through winds) and energy (e.g., through radiation). Our method is based on a conservative, finite-volume, second-order accurate discretization of the equations, which we solve using an unconditionally-stable implicit scheme. We implement Anderson acceleration to speed convergence of the scheme, and show that this leads to factor of ~5 speed gains over non-accelerated methods in realistic problems, though the amount of speedup is highly problem-dependent.

It describes the solar interior plasma (SIP) on the bounded scale and the solar wind plasma (SWP) on the unbounded scale from the viewpoint of plasma-based theory. This differs from the previously reported gravito-electrostatic sheath (GES) model employed to precisely define the solar surface boundary (SSB) on the fact that the present investigation incorporates variable temperature, magnetic field and collisional processes on the solar plasma flow dynamics. We show that the included parameters play important roles in the solar plasma dynamics. We demonstrate that the SSB location shifts outward as a result of the magnetic field by 14 % in comparison with that predicted by the GES model. As a consequence of the interaction of the plasma with magnetic field, the width of the sheath broadens by 25 % in comparison with the GES model predicted value. This physically means that the magnetic field decreases the distribution of the tiny (inertialess) electrons relative to the massive (inertial) ions, which in turn increases the confining wall potential value resulting in the increased width. Besides, the sonic point moves inward by 8 % as a result of collisions in the SIP that leads to rapid acceleration. Here, collisional dynamics plays an important role in the conversion process of the electron thermal energy into the bulk plasma flow energy. An interesting feature of continuous and smooth transition of the electric current density from the SIP to the SWP (with finite positive divergence on both the scales) through the SSB under inhomogeneous temperature distribution is also reported. Finally, the analyses may be applied to understand the realistic equilibrium dynamics of stellar plasmas never addressed before within the earlier GES framework like establishment of current-field correlation, properties of the slow solar wind and its effects on the interaction mechanism with the magnetic field, heliospheric current sheet, etc. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Gravitoelectromagnetism; Plasma sheath; Solar wind","Acheson, D.J., (1990) Elementary Fluid Dynamics, , Oxford University Press, UK:; Aschwanden, M.J., (2005) Physics of the Solar Corona, , Springer, Berlin:; Axford, W.I., McKenzie, J.F., (1996) Astrophys.

Diesel fuel costs represent a significant portion of the utilities' expenditure. Solar photovoltaic (PV) integration is an attractive solution reduces fossil fuel dependency for such communities. This study presents an off-grid hybrid PV/diesel model developed using dynamic modelling and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques. Dynamic subsystem models were developed in Simulink and ANN methods were employed for predictive modelling. Utilizing simple climate data (humidity, rain fall, ambient temperature and wind speed) and load profile as model inputs, generator and PV output powers and fuel consumption can be accurately predicted. Experimental data were used for ANN training and model validation. A comparative analysis was conducted between the Simulink model and an existing industrial design tool for a remote community in the Northern Australia. Simulation results showed that the developed model is a viable planning and analytical tool for aiding future off-grid PV-to-diesel system integration applications, with R2 values ranging from 0.92 to 0.99 and mean relative errors below 5%. Lastly, the incorporation of both dynamic and ANN modelling techniques in a single model reduces modelling complexity whilst maintaining its accuracy and ease-of-use. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Artificial neural network;

Most of the previous design models for calculating airflow due to single-sided natural ventilation have been based on the assumption of simple openings. Since, most windows are not simple openings, but rather can create flow obstructions when opened; the impact of window structure on ventilation needs to be accounted for in order to accurately predict the ventilation rate in buildings. This paper presents an experimental and numerical evaluation of the impact of three types of windows - hopper, awning, and casement - on airflow in the case of single-sided natural ventilation. Semiempirical models for predicting the ventilation rate were developed for these window types and validated by both large-eddy simulations and full-scale measurements. In general, the predictions agreed with the measured results within an error of 25%, and the new models can be used for the design of natural ventilation systems. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Multistage bubble evaporators and multistage bubble condensers allow for effective recovery and reuse of latent heat via a heating/cooling circuit throughout all column stages. The system can operate with salinities of 5000-35,000. ppm. Following the HD process, cooled vapour provides the tropical type greenhouse with a humid environment for selected crops. Additional condensation occurs along the greenhouse skin and is gravity-fed to drip line irrigation. Low grade energy options such as solar-thermal, photovoltaic, wind, geo-thermal and salinity-gradient solar ponds provide the energy for the Bubble-Greenhouse. Alternatively, waste heat from diesel power stations nearby can provide cogeneration of electricity and bubble evaporator heat and pressure requirements. Crops grown inside a greenhouse demonstrate a strongly reduced water demand and the closed environment protects crops from insects and diseases. As the technology is conceptually simple to implement, it holds great potential for community participation, empowerment, skills development and capacity building of local people in remote locations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Bubble evaporation; Greenhouse food production; Greenhouse water desalination; Multi-stage bubble condenser; Remote community development; Thermal desalination","Ahmed, M., Arakel, A., Hoey, D., Thumarukudy, M.R., Goosen, M.F.A., Al-Haddabi, M., Al-Belushi, A., Feasibility of salt production from inland RO desalination plant reject brine: a case study (2003) Desalination, 158, pp. 109-117; Antony, A., Low, J.H., Gray, S., Childress, A.E., Le-Clech, P., Leslie, G., Scale formation and control in high pressure membrane water treatment systems: a review (2011) J.

The significant decrease in 7Be concentrations, corresponding to measurements collected by stations located within Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is demonstrated. This effect can be attributed to the process of enhanced wet deposition within the ITCZ. To quantify this effect data collected by IMS stations within ITCZ were thoroughly analyzed. It was found that the atmospheric content of 7Be strongly decreases under the rain conditions. The rain mediated depletion of 7Be to half of its before rain value, needs about 62h in case of light precipitation, while in the case of moderate precipitation about 38h is needed. In addition the evaluated impact of humidity showed that increase in relative humidity by 20%, for example from 70%±5% to 90%±5% causes almost a double decrease in beryllium concentration in surface air. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Atmospheric aerosols; Beryllium-7; CTBTO global monitoring system; Latitudinal distribution; Scavenging coefficient; Wet deposition","Aldahan, A., Possnert, G., Vintersved, I., Atmospheric interactions at northern high latitudes from weekly Be-isotopes in surface air (2001) Appl.

This study proposes a novel cost-effective validation approach using targeted field measurements and numerical simulations as an alternative to the wind-tunnel and full-scale field measurement approaches that typically require significant human resources and instrumentation to develop convective heat transfer coefficient (CHTC) for buildings located in the urban environment. This study first introduces new CHTC correlations for regular arrays of cubic buildings. A field measurement is then conducted in an actual urban thermal environment characterized by the plan area density λ<inf>p</inf> = 0.25. Afterwards, this urban thermal environment is numerically simulated using CHTC values for the specified λ<inf>p</inf> and appropriate thermal boundary conditions. The results of the numerical simulations are compared with the measured air temperatures to indirectly validate the CHTCs for external surfaces of buildings. The results show that the difference between the simulated and measured air temperatures is small and typically within 5%. Furthermore, this study created a calibrated building energy simulation model to deploy newly developed CHTCs for building heating energy consumption calculations. Specifically, the energy simulations used both newly developed and commonly used CHTCs to analyze the influence of CHTCs on the heating energy simulation results. A comparison between the simulated heating and actual heating energy consumption shows that the developed CHTCs have a positive influence on the accuracy of the energy simulation results. © 2015, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","building energy simulation; CFD simulation; convective heat transfer coefficients; energy consumption; field measurement; outdoor thermal environment","ASHRAE, (2002) ASHRAE Guideline 14-2002.

The tidal forcing is derived from an imposed, boundary-enhanced free-surface deflection that advances cyclonically around a central amphidrome. The tidal forcing perturbs a shallow pycnocline, sloshing it up and down over the shoaling bottom. Nonlinearities in the near-shore internal tide produce an azimuthally independent 'set-up' of the isopycnals that in turn drives an approximately geostrophically balanced, cyclonic, near-shore, sub-surface jet. The sub-surface cyclonic jet is an example of a slowly evolving, nearly balanced flow that is excited and maintained solely by forcing in the fast, super-inertial frequency band. Baroclinic instability of the nearly balanced jet and subsequent interactions between eddies produce a weak transfer of energy back into the inertia-gravity band as swirling motions with super-inertial vorticity stir the stratified fluid and spontaneously emit waves. The sub-surface cyclonic jet is similar in many ways to the poleward flows observed along eastern ocean boundaries, particularly the California Undercurrent. It is conjectured that such currents may be driven by the surface tide rather than by winds and/or along-shore pressure gradients. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Baroclinic instability; Cyclonic jet; Internal tide; Poleward eastern boundary currents","Barkan, R., Winters, K.B., Smith, S.G.L., Energy cascades and loss of balance in a re-entrant channel forced by wind stress and buoyancy fluxes (2014) J.Phys.Oceanogr., 45, pp. 272-293; Collins, C.A., Margolina, T., Rago, T.A., Ivanov, L., Looping RAFOS floats in the California Current System (2013) Deep-Sea Res.

In winter, DCCs are more frequent over the central NP, from approximately 30°N to 45°N, than over other regions. The high frequencies are roughly equal to those occurring in this region in summer. Most of these DCCs have cloud tops above a 12 km altitude, and the highest top is approximately 15 km. These wintertime marine DCCs commonly occur during surface circulation conditions of low pressure, high temperature, strong meridional wind, and high relative humidity. Further, the maximum probability of DCCs, according to the high correlation coefficient, was found in the region 10°–20° east and 5°–10° south of the center of the cyclones. The potential relationship between DCCs and cyclones regarding their relative locations and circulation conditions was also identified by a case study. Deep clouds were generated in the warm conveyor belt by strong updrafts from baroclinic flows. The updrafts intensified when latent heat was released during the adjustment of the cyclone circulation current. This indicates that the dynamics of cyclones are the primary energy source for DCCs over the NP in winter. © 2015, Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","CloudSat; deep convective clouds; marine cyclones; northern Pacific","Alcala, C.M., Dessler, A.E., Observations of deep convection in the tropics using the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (2002) J.

Estimations made by the model are compared to measurements obtained from data loggers installed in an urban canyon of Masdar Institute (Abu Dhabi). Based on these comparisons, we first evaluate the most likely ratios of heat released into the urban canyon by a building air handling unit and the wind tower that produces adiabatically cooled air. Next, we analyze three specific case studies to obtain a local estimate of the accuracy that is reached by the coupled scheme. To estimate its global precision, we perform a sensitivity and Monte-Carlo analysis over the most likely ratios of heat emitted by the air handling unit and the wind tower. Although validation in a dense downtown is still lacking and will be undertaken in the future, this study suggests that urban temperature and humidity can be estimated with an acceptable accuracy under moderate waste heat releases and anthropogenic heat gains. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This tempts policymakers in developing countries to sort out ways to increase commercial energy demand so that their invaluable resources are best utilized. Country like Bangladesh may fall in trap if quickly declining and immensely valuable energy is wasted in unsustainable growth. This urges for better use of its scarce resources for sustainable growth. In this paper, we aim to identify how energy consumption in Bangladesh is related to various growth indicators like national income, financial development, industrialization and urbanization in the long-run in search of a right path for sustainable development. In this study we try to assess the relationship among energy consumption, financial development, economic growth, industrialization and urbanization from 1980 to 2010. A number of cointegration techniques are employed to examine whether there is a long-run relationship. Besides these, we also employed augmented Granger causality test to examine the causality if presents. This study finds that financial development, economic growth, industrialization and urbanization have positive impact on energy consumption in short-run but industrialization has no impact in the long run. Our causality test ensures that the above mentioned variables Granger cause energy consumption. For sustainable growth, industrialization should be given priority as future consumption of energy in industrial sector will be greater than any other sector. This future demand can only be fulfilled by injecting more and more renewable energy through solar, wind and other technology as nonrenewable energy are declining quickly. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cointegration; Dynamic ordinary least squares; Energy consumption; Industrialization","Abosedra, S., Dah, A., Ghosh, S., Electricity consumption and economic growth, the case of Lebanon (2009) Appl Energy, 86 (4), pp. 429-432; Acaravci, A., Ozturk, I., On the relationship between energy consumption, CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and economic growth in Europe (2010) Energy, 35 (12), pp. 5412-5420; Ahamad, G.M., Islam, N.A.K.M., Electricity consumption and economic growth nexus in Bangladesh: revisited evidences (2011) Energy Policy, 39 (10), pp. 6145-6150; Ahmed, A.U., Del Ninno, C., Food for education program in Bangladesh: an evaluation of its impact on educational attainment and food security (2002) Food Consumption and Nutrition Division discussion paper, p. 138; Ahuja, D., Tatsutani, M., Sustainable energy for developing countries (2009) Surv Perspect Integr Environ Soc, 2, p. 1; Ahmed, N., Bakht, Z., Yunus, Md., Size structure of manufacturing industry and implications for growth and poverty (2011) Bangladesh Country Paper, , Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies; Akan, Y., Dogan, M., Isik, C., The causality relationship between energy consumption and economic growth: the case of Turkey (2010) Enerj Piyas Düzenleme Ank, 1 (1), pp. 101-120; Akarca, A.T., Long, T.V., Relationship between energy and GNP: a reexamination (1980) J Energy Dev, 5, p. 2; Amusa, H., Amusa, K., Mabugu, R., Aggregate demand for electricity in South Africa: an analysis using the bounds testing approach to cointegration (2009) Energy Policy, 37 (10), pp. 4167-4175; Aqeel, A., Butt, M.S., The relationship between energy consumption and economic growth in Pakistan (2001) Asia-Pacific Dev J, 8 (2), pp. 101-110; Asafu-Adjaye, J., The relationship between energy consumption, energy prices and economic growth: time series evidence from Asian developing countries (2000) Energy Econ, 22 (6), pp. 615-625; Bahmani-Oskooee, M., How stable is M2 money demand function in Japan?

This paper provides a detailed review of the statistical methods and results from 12 large-scale regional wind integration studies. In particular, we focus our review on the modeling methods and conclusions associated with estimating short-term balancing reserves (regulation and load-following). Several important observations proceed from this review. First, we found that many of the studies either explicitly or implicitly assume that wind power step-change data follow exponential probability distributions, such as the Gaussian distribution. To understand the importance of this issue we compared empirical wind power data to Gaussian data. The results illustrate that the Gaussian assumption significantly underestimates the frequency of very large changes in wind power, and thus may lead to an underestimation of undesirable reliability effects and of operating costs. Secondly, most of these studies make extensive use of wind speed data generated from mesoscale numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. We compared the wind speed data from NWP models with empirical data and found that the NWP data have substantially less power spectral energy, a measure of variability, at higher frequencies relative to the empirical wind data. To the extent that this difference results in reduced high-frequency variability in the simulated wind power plants, studies using this approach could underestimate the need for fast ramping balancing resources. On the other hand, the magnitude of this potential underestimation is uncertain, largely because the methods used for estimating balancing reserve requirements depend on a number of heuristics, several of which are discussed in this review. Finally, we compared the power systems modeling methods used in the studies and suggest potential areas where research and development can reduce uncertainty in future wind integration studies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Generally, renewable technologies require higher initial investments in infrastructure than fossil-based power systems. To assess the tradeoffs of increased up-front emissions and reduced operational emissions, we present, to our knowledge, the first global, integrated life-cycle assessment (LCA) of long-term, wide-scale implementation of electricity generation from renewable sources (i.e., photovoltaic and solar thermal, wind, and hydropower) and of carbon dioxide capture and storage for fossil power generation. We compare emissions causing particulate matter exposure, freshwater ecotoxicity, freshwater eutrophication, and climate change for the climate-change-mitigation (BLUE Map) and business-as-usual (Baseline) scenarios of the International Energy Agency up to 2050. We use a vintage stock model to conduct an LCA of newly installed capacity year-by-year for each region, thus accounting for changes in the energy mix used to manufacture future power plants. Under the Baseline scenario, emissions of air and water pollutants more than double whereas the low-carbon technologies introduced in the BLUE Map scenario allow a doubling of electricity supply while stabilizing or even reducing pollution. Material requirements per unit generation for low-carbon technologies can be higher than for conventional fossil generation: 11-40 times more copper for photovoltaic systems and 6-14 times more iron for wind power plants. However, only two years of current global copper and one year of iron production will suffice to build a low-carbon energy system capable of supplying the world's electricity needs in 2050. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

The widespread presence of distributed generation (DG) units reduces the loading passing through the distribution transformers and consequently improves the dynamic thermal failures. The system reliability is investigated for various penetrations of different scenarios from the view of DG technologies. The introduced method is applied to a realistic distribution system comprising different distribution transformers in Iran. The sensitivity analysis corresponding to adequacy indices such as expected energy not-supplied (EENS) based on DG penetrations is performed. By the use of the novel methodology proposed, it is possible to recognize how different DG technologies and penetrations can impact on the system reliability. The results demonstrate that the diesel generators and hybrid systems including diesel generators, photovoltaic units, and wind turbines are the most promising DG technologies to improve the transformer failures and the reliability of micro-grids compared with renewable DG units. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The development of wind power may lead to unexpected environmental impacts. This paper systematically reviews the available evidence on the impacts of wind energy on environments in terms of noise pollution, bird and bat fatalities, greenhouse gas emissions, and land surface impacts. We conclude that wind energy has an important role to play in future energy generation, but more effort should be devoted to studying the overall environmental impacts of wind power, so that society can make informed decisions when weighing the advantages and disadvantages of particular wind power development. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However Tenerife has reached grid parity in photovoltaics (PV) and wind energy. The Spanish government has just approved a new legislation to stimulate the deployment of new PV and wind energy systems in all Spanish insular systems mainly to reduce the cost of these systems. This paper analyses the current electric power system and energy production in Tenerife, especially PV and wind energy, and investigates the consequences of this new legislation and the planning initially approved by the government of the Canary Islands to substantially increase the share of both technologies in the horizon 2020. This paper shows that the Tenerife power system is technically capable of managing the ramps expected to occur in the defined near term scenarios. However, the cost per MWh will increase because of the curtailment of renewable energy generation and the operation of the thermal power system in suboptimal conditions.

And while it provides the flexibility and adaptability needed for climate change initiatives, the paper argues that many networks collaborate too loosely to have the capacity to reach strategic goals or mobilize local players. There is often a disconnect between national policy goals and on-the-ground dynamics. Instead, government should adopt a network perspective which does not eliminate state action, but involves network management institutions at arm’s length of government. As an example for this mode of network governance, the research looks at the Swedish “National Network for Wind Power”, which was initiated by government and is now led by four wind coordinators managing the development of on- and off-shore wind electricity. The paper compares Swedish performance before and after the introduction of the wind network and shows how these government efforts have transformed Sweden from a weak performer to being a frontrunner in Europe. © 2015 The Editor, Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis: Research and Practice","case study; climate change; comparative; network governance; network management; renewable energy; wind power",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929438576

The strongest challenges for wind energy conversion system (WECS) are to handle the intermittency of wind and to maintain the grid reliability. The power electronics and energy storage systems are essential elements of the WECS. This paper attempts to provide various new directions to the future wind energy researchers to improve the wind turbine aerodynamics, electric generators' configurations with improved control of power electronics and lower cost energy storage system for designing a reliable wind turbine generator system. This study will work as a guideline for the researchers to understand the development and requirement of a reliable and smart wind energy conversion system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, there lies great potential for small wind turbines (SWT) in areas with sufficient wind resources. This paper presents a review of the SWT sector in Kenya. The review consists of a description of the status of the sector and a more in-depth investigation into factors and dynamics that hinder sector growth. This investigation is performed by using a combination of two theoretical approaches: Strategic Niche Management (SNM) and the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP). The main insights from this review are that the SWT sector in Kenya is growing but is characterized by one-time experiments, fragmented learning experiences, lack of focus and low quality products and services. The weakly aligned network with many underperforming actors and unaligned expectations is the main cause of the weak current status of the sector. Despite the low rural electricity access and growing electricity demand, niche upscaling remains cumbersome due to external factors such as corruption, poverty, lack of innovation and an anti-entrepreneurial mind-set. The results of this review serve as inputs for recommendations for all niche actors on what can be done to make the niche grow. In addition, the paper includes ideas on how the SNM and MLP approaches could become better suited for reviewing and analyzing renewable energy technologies in developing countries such as SWTs in the Kenyan context. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Kenya; Multi-Level Perspective; Small wind turbine; Strategic Niche Management","http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/resources/energydevelopment/energyaccessdatabase/, Energy Access Database.

In this work, a megawatt wind turbine drive train is subject to theoretical and experimental dynamic analysis. The method of rigid-flexible coupling multibody dynamics was applied to develop a dynamic model of the entire drive train. This model was then used to study the natural characteristics of the system. The blades, hub, main shaft, and speed-up gearbox in the dynamic model were modeled as flexible bodies. The potential resonances of the system were detected through Campbell and modal energy distribution analyses. Theoretical results show that the first-order natural frequency of the system is approximately 1.72 Hz. This frequency represents a torsional vibration mode, Moreover, resonances are not observed within the normal operating speed range of the drive train.

The disturbances affect active power quality, reactive power and r.m.s. phase to phase voltage. In this paper, we propose an original system and control to solve firstly the problems due to the variation of DC-voltage source and secondly the brutal impact of active and reactive powers. The principle of the proposed wind energy system with STATCOM supercapacitor energy storage is to limit the rapid variation of active power and give the required reactive power compensation to the induction machine during the torque change. The supercapacitor is directly coupled to the common DC-link of the whole bidirectional DC-AC converter. The control strategy of the STATCOM uses a Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) approach to regulate the currents injected or absorbed by the inverter. The same strategy is used to control the variable DC supercapacitor voltage. The simulation results of the STATCOM using a state-feedback with integral controller for id, iq currents of the converter and a simple proportional (Kp) controller cascaded to d axis current loop for DC voltage source are presented and discussed. Finally, implementation in real time is performed and the first experimental results are presented to validate the proposed control. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The object is to study and model the correlation and fluctuation of load demands, photovoltaic (PV) and wind power plants (WPPs) which have an important influence on transmission lines and bus voltages. Moreover, as an important tool of saving waste heat energy in the thermoelectric power plant, the power networks share of combined heat and power (CHP) has increased dramatically in the past decade. So, the probabilistic OPF (POPF) problem considering valve point effects, multi-fuel options and prohibited zones of thermal units (TUs) is firstly formulated. The PV, WPP and CHP units are also modeled. Then, a new method utilizing enhanced binary black hole (EBBH) algorithm and 2m + 1 point estimated method is proposed to solve this problem and to handle the random nature of solar irradiance, wind speed and load of consumers. The correlation between input random variables is considered using a correlation matrix. Finally, numerical results are presented and considered regarding the IEEE 118-busses, including PV, WPP, CHP and TU at several busses. The simulation and comparison results obtained demonstrate the broad advantages and feasibility of the suggested framework in the presence of dependent non-Gaussian distribution of random variables. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Combined heat and power; Enhanced binary black hole algorithm; optimal power flow; Photovoltaic system; Power system correlations; Probabilistic; Wind energy","Madrigal, M., Ponnambalam, K., Quintana, V.H., Probabilistic optimal power flow (1998) Proc.

During October 2006, there were extensive damages along the east Korean coast due to high storm waves induced by winter storms passing over the ES. This paper investigates the performance of a wave model, WAVEWATCH III, for the rough sea conditions in October 2006 with respect to the wind input and dissipation terms because the wave-breaking dissipation is the least known source term, which acts as a tuning knob for the closure of the action balance equation. Three package-like wind input-dissipation parameterizations, the WAM3 type (WAM-equiv), Tolman and Chalikov terms (TC96), and WAM4 type and its variant (WAM4+), are used experimentally for their performances under the same wind forcing obtained from atmospheric modelling with WRF. Overall, all experiments illustrate good accordance with observed wave characteristics. Among them, the WAM4+ results exhibit the best performance based on the Taylor diagram and index of agreement. In terms of dissipation behaviour, the TC96 results depict high energy losses at high frequency over 0.25 Hz, whereas the WAM-equiv runs display less dissipation at the same frequency. The WAM4+ results lie between those of the WAM-equiv and TC96. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this research the required spinning reserve is detached into two main parts. The first part of the reserve is procured to overcome imbalances between load and generation in the system. The second part of the required spinning reserve is scheduled according to the probability of unit outages. In order to overcome uncertainties caused by wind generation and load forecasting errors different scenarios of wind generation and load uncertainties are generated. For each scenario the reserve deployed by different components are taken account as the first part of the required reserve which is used to overcome imbalances. The second part of the required reserve is based on reliability constraints. The total expected energy not supplied (TEENS) is the reliability criterion which determines the second part of the required spinning reserve to overcome unit outage possibilities. This formulation permits the independent system operator to purchase the two different types of reserve with different prices. The introduced formulation for reserve quantification is also capable of managing and detaching the reserve provided by responsive loads and energy storage devices. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem including linearized formulations for reliability metrics. Obtained results show the efficiency of the proposed approach compared with the conventional stochastic and deterministic approach. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Demand response; Energy storage device;

In order to model wind speed data smoothly, several statistical distributions have been studied. Truncated distributions are defined as a conditional distribution that results from restricting the domain of statistical distribution and they also cover base distribution. This paper proposes, for the first time, the use of upper-truncated Weibull distribution, in modeling wind speed data and also in estimating wind power density. In addition, a comparison is made between upper-truncated Weibull distribution and well known Weibull distribution using wind speed data measured in various regions of Turkey. The obtained results indicate that upper-truncated Weibull distribution shows better performance than Weibull distribution in estimating wind speed distribution and wind power. Therefore, upper-truncated Weibull distribution can be an alternative for use in the assessment of wind energy potential. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Key thermoeconomic parameters are examined which include, cost of the power produced, cost of the exergy lost, exergy efficiency, exergetic improvement potential, air mass flow rate through the wind turbine, and power produced. It was concluded that the wind turbine performance improved as the shroud area ratio increased. Consequently, the cost of the power produced became low for the case of high area ratio and vice-versa. It was demonstrated that the cost was significantly high under low wind speed. The same finding was observed for the cost rate of the exergy loss in which the cost was the lowest for the highest area ratio value considered in the present study. The findings also showed that the exergetic improvement potential increased as the wind speed increased and exergetic improvement potential enhanced further at high shroud area ratio. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Cost of power; Exergy efficiency; Exergy loss; Shrouded wind turbines; Thermoeconomic; Wind energy","Igra, O., Research and development for shrouded wind turbines (1981) Energy Convers Manage, 21 (1), pp. 13-48; Fletcher, C.A.J., Computational analysis of diffuser-augmented wind turbines (1981) Energy Convers Manage, 21, pp. 175-183; Dick, E., Momentum analysis of wind energy concentrator systems (1984) Energy Convers Manage, 24, pp. 19-25; Hansen, M.O.L., Sørensen, N.N., Flay, R.G.J., Effect of placing a diffuser around a wind turbine (2000) Wind Energy, 3, pp. 207-213; Dias Do Rio Vaz, D.A.T., Mesquita, A.L.A., Vaz, J.R.P., Blanco, C.J.C., Pinho, J.T., An extension of the blade element momentum method applied to diffuser augmented wind turbines (2014) Energy Convers Manage, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.03.064; Werle, M.J., Presz, W.M., Ducted wind/water turbines and propellers revisited (2008) J Propul Power, 24 (5), pp. 1146-1150; Ozgener, O., A small wind turbine system (SWTS) application and its performance analysis (2006) Energy Convers Manage, 47, pp. 1326-1337; Ozgener, O., Ozgener, L., Exergy and reliability analysis of wind turbine systems: A case study (2007) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 11 (8), pp. 1811-1826; Pope, K., Dincer, I., Naterer, G.F., Energy and exergy efficiency comparison of horizontal and vertical axis wind turbines (2010) Renew Energy, 35 (9), pp. 2102-2113; Redha, A.M., Dincer, I., Gadalla, M., Thermodynamic performance assessment of wind energy systems: An application (2011) Energy, 36 (7), pp. 4002-4010; Baskut, O., Ozgener, O., Ozgener, L., Second law analysis of wind turbine power plants: Cesme, Izmir example (2011) Energy, 36 (5), pp. 2535-2542; Mostafaeipour, A., Economic evaluation of small wind turbine utilization in Kerman, Iran (2013) Energy Convers Manage, 73, pp. 214-225; Ozgenera, O., Ozgenerb, L., Dincer, I., Analysis of some exergoeconomic parameters of small wind turbine system (2009) Int J Green Energy, 6 (1), pp. 42-56; Baskut, O., Ozgener, L., Exergoeconomic assessment of a wind turbine power plant (WTTP): Cesme, Izmir, example (2012) Energy, 47, pp. 577-581; Sahin, A.D., Dincer, I., Rosen, M.A., New spatio-temporal wind exergy maps (2006) ASME J Energy Resour Technol, 128 (3), pp. 194-202; Koroneos, C., Katopodi, E., Maximization of wind energy penetration with the use of H2 production - An exergy approach (2011) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 15, pp. 648-656; Van Gool, W., Energy policy: Fairy tales and factualities (1997) Innovation and Technology - Strategies and Policies, , Springer; Bejan, A., Tsatsaronis, G., Moran, M., (1995) Thermal Design and Optimization, , Wiley; Energy Analysis Department, Simple Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) Calculator Documentation, , http://%20www.nrel.gov/analysis/tech_lcoe_documentation.html, accessed June 2014; Short, W., Packey, D.J., Holt, T., (1995) A Manual for the Economic Evaluation of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Technologies, , NREL/TP-462-5173; Tegen, S., Lantz, E., Hand, M., Maples, B., Smith, A., Schwabe, P., (2011) Cost of Wind Energy: Review, , National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Agency IRE, (2012) Renewable Energy Technologies: Cost Analysis Series: Wind Power, , IRENA; Cory, K., Schwabe, P., (2009) Wind Levelized Cost of Energy: A Comparison of Technical and Financing Input Variables, , Technical report",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925308307

The isolated wind energy system using Double-fed Induction Generator is capable of supplying different loads such as balanced, unbalanced and nonlinear loads. The isolated wind energy supply is designed by using wound rotor induction generator and partial scale back to back connected voltage source converters at rotor side. The voltage source converters are called rotor-front voltage source converter and load/stator-front voltage source converter having the common capacitive direct current link. The presented study investigates the application stator/load side converter for load harmonics mitigation in isolated Double-fed Induction Generator based Wind Power Supply System. The shunt active power filter function is added in the convention control scheme of the load/stator-front voltage source converter to improve load harmonics. The control scheme proposed for stator/load side converter is based on the instantaneous active and reactive component of the load current method. Also a new and simple technique for rotor side converter is presented to regulate Voltage and Frequency at stator/load terminals. Different possible case studies are presented to show the effectiveness of both techniques proposed. Simulation results obtained from a 2 MVA Double-fed Induction Generator based wind power system, prototype in MATLab/Simulink, are given and discussed in this paper. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is applied to Jilin City to conduct 16 terms of dynamic simulation work with GRP as objective function subject to mass, value and energy balances aided by the extended input-output table with renewable energy industries introduced. Simulation results indicate that achievement of GHG emission reduction target is contributed by renewable energy industries, ERPs and industrial restructuring collectively, which reshape the terminal energy consumption structure with a larger proportion of renewable energy. Wind power, hydropower and biomass combustion power industries account for more in the power generation structure implying better industrial prospects. Mining, chemical, petroleum processing, non-metal, metal and thermal power industries are major targets for industrial restructuring.

The distributed generations are considered as wind generators, photovoltaic generators, battery energy storage systems in the supply side and a large number of smart houses in the demand side. A smart house consists of the electric vehicle, heat pump, photovoltaic generator and solar collector. The electric vehicle and heat pump are considered as the controllable loads which can compensate the power for the forecast error of renewable energy sources. As a result, power generation cost of the smart grid can reduce through coordinated with distributed generations and thermal units scheduling process. The electric vehicles of the smart house are considered as the spinning reserve in the scheduling process which lead to lessen the additional operation of thermal units. Finally, obtained results of the proposed system have been compared with the conventional method. The conventional method does not consider the electric vehicle in the smart houses. The acquired results demonstrate that total power generation cost of the smart grid has been reduced by the proposed method considering forecast error. Effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified by the extensive simulation results using MATLAB® software. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Battery energy storage; Electric vehicle; Smart grid; Smart houses; Thermal unit commitment; Wind power uncertainty","Sun, C.W., Ouyang, X.L., Cai, H.B., Luo, Z.C., Li, A.J., Household pathway selection of energy consumption during urbanization process in China (2014) Energy Convers Manage, 84, pp. 295-304; Wu, B., Wang, L., Comparable analysis methodology of CCHP based on distributed energy system (2014) Energy Convers Manage, 88, pp. 863-871; Chen, K., Wang, J.F., Dai, Y.P., Liu, Y.Q., Thermodynamic analysis of a low-temperature waste heat recovery system based on the concept of solar chimney (2014) Energy Convers Manage, 80, pp. 78-86; Thornton, A., Monroy, C.R., Distributed power generation in the United States (2011) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 15, pp. 4809-4817; Ferrari, M.L., Traverso, A., Pascenti, M., Massardo, A.F., Plant management tools tested with a small-scale distributed generation laboratory (2014) Energy Convers Manage, 78, pp. 105-113; Choudar, A., Boukhetala, D., Barkat, S., Brucker, J.M., A local energy management of a hybrid PV-storage based distributed generation for microgrids (2015) Energy Convers Manage, 90, pp. 21-33; Picciariello, A., Reneses, J., Frias, P., Soder, L., Distributed generation and distribution pricing: Why do we need new tariff design methodologies?

The variable nature and limited predictability of some renewables will require novel system operation methods to properly size and cost-efficiently allocate the required reserves. The current state-of-the-art stochastic unit commitment models internalize this sizing and allocation process by considering a set of scenarios representing the stochastic input during the unit commitment optimization. This results in a cost-efficient scheduling of reserves, while maintaining the reliability of the system. However, calculation times are typically high. Therefore, in this paper, we merge a state-of-the-art probabilistic reserve sizing technique and stochastic unit commitment model with a limited number of scenarios in order to reduce the computational cost. Results obtained for a power system with a 30% wind energy penetration show that this hybrid approach allows to approximate the expected operational costs and reliability of the resulting unit commitment of the stochastic model at roughly one thirtieth of the computational cost. The presented hybrid unit commitment model can be used by researchers to assess the impact of uncertainty on power systems or by independent system operators to optimize their unit commitment decisions taking into account the uncertainty in their system.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929598447

Efficient electrochemical energy storage devices play a crucial role in storing harvested energies in our daily lives. For example, rechargeable batteries can store energy generated by solar cells during the daytime and release it during night-time. In particular, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have received considerable attention ever since their early commercialization in 1990s. However, with initiatives by several governments to build large-scale energy grids to store energy for cities, problems such as the high cost and limited availability of lithium starts to become major issues. Sodium, which also belongs to Group 1 of the periodic table, has comparable electrochemical properties to Lithium, and more importantly it is considerably more accessible than lithium. Nonetheless, research into sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) is currently still in its infancy compared to LIBs, although great leaps and bounds have been made recently in terms of research and development into this technology. Here in this review, we summarize the recent advancements made, also covering the prospective materials for both the battery cathode and anode. Additionally, opinions on possible solutions through correlating trends in recent papers will be suggested. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Tarascon, J.-M., Armand, M., (2001) Nature, 414, pp. 359-367; Arico, A.S., Bruce, P., Scrosati, B., Tarascon, J.-M., Van Schalkwijk, W., (2005) Nat.

This paper presents various potential ANM schemes based on the photovoltaic inverter control (PVIC) considering enhanced utilization of the inverter reactive power capability. Depending on the active power generation of PV arrays, inverter size and desired reactive power settings, several PVIC schemes are proposed. The PVIC schemes are incorporated in the optimal power flow (OPF) and formulated as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem. In this study, the PVIC schemes are applied to maximize the total wind-distributed generation (DG) penetration on a typical U.K. distribution system. Various case studies are presented and compared to evaluate the performance. The results show that the proposed schemes can significantly increase the wind penetration levels by 45.4% and up to 92.3%.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929591319

Through field investigation and review of the previous literature, the authors have investigated the distribution, thickness and age of the Xinjiang loess, and analyzed factors that control these parameters in the Xinjiang in northwest China, Central Asia. The loess sediments cover river terraces, low uplands, the margins of deserts and the slopes of the Tianshan Mountains and Kunlun Mountains and are also present in the Ili Basin. The thickness of the Xinjiang loess deposits varies from several meters to 670 m. The variation trend of the sand fraction (>63 μm) grain-size contour can indicate the local major wind directions, so we conclude that the NW and NE winds are the main wind directions in the North and South Xinjiang, and the westerly wind mainly transport dust into the Ili basin. We consider persistent drying, adequate regional wind energy and well-developed river terraces to be the main factors controlling the distribution, thickness and formation age of the Xinjiang loess. The well-outcropped loess sections have mainly developed since the middle Pleistocene in Xinjiang, reflecting the appearance of the persistent drying and the present air circulation system. However, the oldest loess deposits are as old as the beginning of the Pliocene in the Tarim Basin, which suggests that earlier aridification occurred in the Tarim Basin rather than in the Ili Basin and the Junggar Basin. © 2015 Li et al.",,"An, Z.S., The history and variability of the East Asian paleomonsoon climate (2000) Quat Sci Rev, 19, pp. 171-187; Zachos, J., Pagani, M., Sloan, L., Thomas, E., Billups, K., Trends, Rhythms, and Aberrations in Global Climate 65 Ma to Present (2001) Science, 292, pp. 686-693. , PMID: 11326091; An, Z.S., Liu, T.S., Lu, Y.C., Porter, S.C., Kukla, G., Wu, X.H., The long-term paleomonsoon variation recorded by the loess-paleosol sequence in Central China (1990) Quat Int, 7-8, pp. 91-95; Guo, Z.T., Ruddiman, W., Hao, Q.Z., Wu, H.B., Qiao, Y.S., Zhu, R.X., Onset of Asian desertification by 22Myr ago inferred from loess deposits in China (2002) Nature, 416, pp. 159-163. , PMID: 11894089; Li, Y., Song, Y.G., Qian, L.B., Li, X.M., Qiang, X.K., An, Z.S., Paleomagnetic and fission-track dating of a Late Cenozoic red earth section in the Liupan Shan and associated tectonic implications (2013) J Earth Sci, 24, pp. 506-518; Liang, L.J., Sun, Y.B., Beets, C.J., Prins, M.A., Wu, F., Vandenberghe, J., Impacts of grain size sorting and chemical weathering on the geochemistry of Jingyuan loess in the northwestern Chinese Loess Plateau (2013) J Asian Earth Sci, 69, pp. 177-184; Song, Y.G., Fang, X.M., Li, J.S., An, Z.S., Miao, X.D., The Late Cenozoic uplift of the Liupan Shan, China (2001) Sci China D: Earth Sci, 44, pp. 176-184; Song, Y.G., Li, J.J.M., Xia, F., Dong, H.M., Red clay sediment in the central Chinese Loess Plateau and its implication for the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau (2005) J Mount Sci, 2, pp. 137-145; Song, Y.G., Shi, Z.T., Dong, H.M., Nie, J.S., Qian, L.B., Chang, H., Loess magnetic susceptibility in Central Asia and its paleoclimatic significance (2008) Intern Geosci & Remote Sens Symp, 2, pp. 1227-1230; Sun, Y.B., Clemens, S.C., An, Z.S., Yu, Z.W., Astronomical timescale and palaeoclimatic implication of stacked 3.6-Myr monsoon records from the Chinese Loess Plateau (2006) Quat Sci Rev, 25, pp. 33-48; Sun, Y.B., Wang, X.L., Liu, Q.S., Clemens, S.C., Impacts of post-depositional processes on rapid monsoon signals recorded by the last glacial loess deposits of northern China (2010) Earth Planet Sci Lett, 289, pp. 171-179; Xiong, S., Ding, Z., Zhu, Y., Zhou, R., Lu, H., A ∼6 Ma chemical weathering history, the grain size dependence of chemical weathering intensity, and its implications for provenance change of the Chinese loess-red clay deposit (2010) Quat Sci Rev, 29, pp. 1911-1922; Obruchev, V.A., (1958) The Questions of the Origin of Loess the Question of Sand and Loess, , Science press, Beijing; Liu, T.S., (1965) The Loess Deposits in China, 251p; Fang, X.M., Lü, L.Q., Yang, S.L., Li, J.J., An, Z.S., Jiang, P.A., Loess in Kunlun Mountains and its implications on desert development and Tibetan Plateau uplift in west China (2002) Sci China D: Earth Sci, 45, pp. 289-299; Fang, X.M., Shi, Z.T., Yang, S.L., Yan, M.D., Li, J.J., Jiang, P.A., Loess in the Tian Shan and its implications for the development of the Gurbantunggut Desert and drying of northern Xinjiang (2002) Chin Sci Bull, 47, pp. 1381-1387; Song, Y.G., Chen, X.L., Qian, L.B., Li, C.X., Li, Y., Li, X.X., Distribution and composition of loess sediments in the Ili Basin, Central Asia (2014) Quat Int, 334-335, pp. 61-73; Song, Y.G., Shi, Z.T., Fang, X.M., Nie, J.S., Naoto, I., Qiang, X.K., Loess magnetic properties in the Ili Basin and their correlation with the Chinese Loess Plateau (2010) SCI CHINA Earth Sci, 53, pp. 419-431; Sun, J.M., Source Regions and Formation of the Loess Sediments on the High Mountain Regions of Northwestern China (2002) Quat Res, 58, pp. 341-351; Jia, J., Xia, D.S., Wang, B., Wei, H.T., Liu, X.M., Magnetic investigation of Late Quaternary loess deposition, Ili area, China (2012) Quat Int, 250, pp. 84-92; Jia, J., Xia, D., Wang, B., Zhao, S., Li, G., Wei, H., The investigation of magnetic susceptibility variation mechanism of Tien Mountains modern loess: Pedogenic or wind intensity model?

With no adjustable parameters, the parametrisation yields the horizontal and vertical mesoscale fluxes in terms of coarse-resolution fields and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). We compare terms of the parametrisation diagnosed from coarse-grained fields with the eddy mesoscale fluxes diagnosed directly from the high resolution model. An expression for the EKE in terms of mean fields has also been found to get a closed parametrisation in terms of the mean fields only. In 40 numerical experiments we simulated two types of flows: idealised flows driven by baroclinic instabilities only, and more realistic flows, driven by wind and surface fluxes as well as by inflow-outflow. The diagnosed quasi-instantaneous horizontal and vertical mesoscale buoyancy fluxes (averaged over (Formula presented.) – (Formula presented.) and 10 days) demonstrate a strong scatter typical for turbulent flows, however, the fluxes are positively correlated with the parametrisation with higher ((Formula presented.)) correlations at the experiments with larger baroclinic radius Rossby. After being averaged over 3–4 months, diffusivities diagnosed from the eddy resolving simulations are consistent with the parametrisation for a broad range of parameters. Diagnosed vertical mesoscale fluxes restratify mixed layer and are in a good agreement with the parametrisation unless vertical turbulent mixing in the upper layer becomes strong enough in comparison with mesoscale advection. In the latter case, numerical simulations demonstrate that the deviation of the fluxes from the parametrisation is controlled by dimensionless parameter estimating the ratio of vertical turbulent mixing term to mesoscale advection. An analysis using a modified (Formula presented.)-equation reveals that the effects of the vertical mixing of vorticity is responsible for the two–three fold amplification of vertical mesoscale flux. Possible physical mechanisms, responsible for the amplification of vertical mesoscale flux are discussed. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","(Formula presented.)-equation; Active mixed layer; Eddy diffusivity; Eddy resolving simulations; Mesoscale parametrisation; Restratification",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929256676

The increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy, and the development of advanced information and communication technologies, give rise to questions on how additional flexibility obtained from loads can be used in order to optimize the use of resources and assets. This paper proposes a comprehensive stochastic decision making model for the coordinated operation of wind power producers and demand response (DR) aggregators participating in the day-ahead market. In order to account for the uncertainty around the true outcomes of day-ahead prices and wind power, a minimum conditional value at risk term has been included in the model formulation. Numerical results illustrate how the proposed bidding strategy for wind and demand response (DR) pairing increases the expected benefit of both resources and reduces the related risk.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929207012

Two distinct spectral regions (separated by a smooth break at proton scales) develop with clear power-law scaling, each one occupying about a decade in wavenumbers. The simulation results simultaneously exhibit several properties of the observed solar wind fluctuations: spectral indices of the magnetic, kinetic, and residual energy spectra in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) inertial range along with a flattening of the electric field spectrum, an increase in magnetic compressibility, and a strong coupling of the cascade with the density and the parallel component of the magnetic fluctuations at sub-proton scales. Our findings support the interpretation that in the solar wind, large-scale MHD fluctuations naturally evolve beyond proton scales into a turbulent regime that is governed by the generalized Ohm's law. © 2015.

Extensive studies examined the kinetic properties of Alfvén waves in simple Maxwellian or bi-Maxwellian plasmas. However, the observed electron velocity distribution functions in the solar wind are more complex. In this study, we analyze the properties of kinetic Alfvén waves (KAWs) in a plasma with two drifting electron populations. We numerically solve the linearized Maxwell-Vlasov equations and find that the damping rate and the proton-electron energy partition for KAWs are significantly modified in such plasmas, compared to plasmas without electron drifts. We suggest that electron drift is an important factor to take into account when considering the dissipation of Alfvénic turbulence in the solar wind or other β ∼ 1 astrophysical plasmas. © 2015.

Within high mountain Asia, WWD are the primary contributor to regional precipitation during winter. In this work, we present a novel WWD tracking methodology, which provides an inventory of location, timing, intensity, and duration of events, allowing for a comprehensive study of the factors that relate WWD to orographic precipitation, on an individual event basis and in the aggregate. We identify the relationship between the strength of disturbances, the state of the background environment during their propagation, and precipitation totals in the Karakoram/western Himalaya. We observe significant differences in convective and mechanical instability contributions to orographic precipitation as a function of the relationship between the intensity of WWD and the background temperature and moisture fields, which exhibit strong intraseasonal variability. Precipitation is primarily orographically forced during intense WWD with strong cross-barrier winds, while weaker WWD with similar precipitation totals are observed to benefit from enhanced instability due to high moisture content and temperature at low levels, occurring primarily in the late winter/premonsoon. The contribution of these factors is observed to fluctuate on a per-case basis, indicating important influences of intraseasonal oscillations and tropical-extratropical interactions on regional precipitation. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Wien",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929095825

The purpose of this paper is to propose a new direct-drive wind power generator (DWPG), which can offer ultra-high torque density. First, magnetic gear (MG) is integrated to achieve non-contact torque transmission and speed variation. Second, armature windings are engaged to achieve electromechanical energy conversion. Interior permanent magnet (PM) design on the inner rotor is adopted to boost the torque transmission capability of the integrated MG. Nevertheless, due to lack of back iron on the stator, the proposed generator does not exhibit prominent salient feature, which usually exists in traditional interior PM (IPM) machines. This makes it with good controllability and high power factor as the surface-mounted permanent magnet machines. The performance is analyzed using finite element method. Investigation on the magnetic field harmonics demonstrates that the permanent-magnetic torque offered by the MG can work together with the electromagnetic torque offered by the armature windings to balance the driving torque captured by the wind turbine. This allows the proposed generator having the potential to offer even higher torque density than its integrated MG. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Chen, J., Nayar, C., Xu, L., (2000) IEEE Trans.

It is found that these intense substorms are typically isolated events and are only loosely related to magnetic storms. SSS events can occur during super (Dst &leq;&ndash;250 nT) and intense ('100 nT &geq; Dst >&ndash;250) magnetic storms. SSS events can also occur during nonstorm (Dst &geq;&ndash;50 nT) intervals. SSSs are important because the strongest ionospheric currents will flow during these events, potentially causing power outages on Earth. Several SSS examples are shown. SSS events appear to be externally triggered by small regions of very high density (∼30 to 50 cm&minus;3) solar wind plasma parcels (PPs) impinging upon the magnetosphere. Precursor southward interplanetary magnetic fields are detected prior to the PPs hitting the magnetosphere. Our hypothesis is that these southward fields input energy into the magnetosphere/magnetotail and the PPs trigger the release of the stored energy. © Author(s) 2015.

To this end, lower-carbon infrastructure (LCI) developments are likely to increase. However, oppositional local social networks regularly slow or halt LCI proposals during the public participation processes conducted during planning. Using social capital as a conceptual lens, an analytical framework is developed with the aim of improving current understanding of local resistance. Specifically, the framework analyses the lifecycle of social networks through two case studies that explore resistance to a wind farm and a gas-fired power plant. The analysis identifies reasons for the formation, operation, dissipation, and endurance of the social networks. The article is relevant to public participation processes in natural resource management and infrastructure proposals in the rural and outer urban fringe. 2015 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC","lower-carbon infrastructure; resistance; social capital; social networks",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929001250

E.","Improving offshore wind turbine reliability is a key industry goal to improve the availability of this renewable energy generation source. The semiconductor devices in the wind turbine power converter are traditionally considered as the most sensitive and important components to achieve this and managing their thermomechanical stressing is vital, since this is one of their principal long-term aging mechanisms. Conventional deterministic reliability prediction methods used in industrial applications are not suitable for wind turbine applications, due to the stochastic nature of the wind speed. This paper develops an electrothermal model of the power devices, which is integrated with a wind turbine system model for the investigation of power converter thermal cycling under various operating conditions. The model has been developed to eliminate the problems of pulse width modulation switching, substantially reducing simulation time. The model is used to improve the current controller tuning method to reduce thermal stresses suffered by the converter during a grid fault. The model is finally used to design a control method to alleviate a key problem of the doubly fed induction generator—severe thermal cycling caused during operation near synchronous speed.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928975182
