Therefore, it is of paramount importance to understand and predict their performance in different ambient conditions. Here, we explore the influence of air exposure on the electrical conduction in carbon nanotube fibres and films produced via floating catalyst chemical vapour deposition. We recognise that on top of the previously well-explored oxygen doping effect these macroscopic materials are also significantly affected by humidity. The adsorption of water vapour causes an increase in the weight of the assemblies, increase in electrical conductivity at room temperature or changes in the resistance-temperature dependence at low temperatures. It is suggested that the water vapour is mainly adsorbed by the standard clustering mechanisms observed in other carbon materials, but the mechanisms responsible for the improvement in electrical performance are much more debatable. We present a strong indication that the carbon nanotubes are neither n-doped nor p-doped by water molecules and provide further discussion on the potential role of water in the electrical transport of carbon nanotube assemblies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the wettability of these carbons has not been investigated as yet. In this work, CICs with different pore sizes (20-50 nm) were synthesized and heat treated at 1500 °C under a N<inf>2</inf> atmosphere. Heat treatment was found to not alter the nanoporous structure of these carbons, but did significantly decrease their oxygen content. Contact angle kinetics (CAK) and water vapor sorption (WVS) experiments were carried out to determine the wettability of the CICs, before and after heat treatment, showing that the as-synthesized CICs surfaces are much more hydrophilic when compared to commercial carbon black (Vulcan carbon, VC). The high hydrophilicity of the CICs is likely due to their high surface-specific oxygen atomic density (∼10 μmol m-2). Further heat treatment significantly decreases the hydrophilicity of CICs because of the removal of oxygen atoms from their surfaces, as also reflected by their cyclic voltammetric response in acidic solutions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies on this topic have been limited to the basal surface of graphite. Apparent water-contact angle (WCA) values reported in the literature for the basal surface of graphite or graphene sheet vary from 35° to 126°, due to factors such as surface contamination and roughness. The intrinsic wettability of graphitic carbon remains uncertain. Here we report the first experimental attempt of quantifying the intrinsic wettability of the edge surface of graphite. We show that the basal surface is intrinsically hydrophilic with a WCA of about 61°; the edge surface is more hydrophilic than the basal surface and has an intrinsic WCA likely less than 40°. We also show that the apparent WCA is highly sensitive to sample preparation procedures. Annealing, a commonly used method for removing surface organic contaminants, could result in an underestimated WCA due to oxidation by the trace O<inf>2</inf> in the inert gases. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Although continuous progresses have been achieved in the syntheses of diverse GQDs, it is still a challenge in size-controllable and high-yield preparation of well dispersed GQDs via simple routes. Herein, we present a top-down synthesis of GQDs by using a SBA-15 template as a nanoreactor via a HNO<inf>3</inf> vapor cutting strategy. With the recyclable ordered mesoporous SBA-15 template and a silica grid, a high-yield (48%) preparation as well as a facile separation of yellow-luminescent GQDs have been achieved. The obtained GQDs containing abundant oxygen-containing groups (ca. 30% for oxygen content) showed a narrow size distribution (2.5-5.2 nm), good water solubility, good photostability and high selectivity for Fe(III) sensing in tap water with satisfying recovery. Further experiments indicated that Cu(II), Co(II), Mn(II), Ni(II) could also quench the fluorescence of the as-prepared GQD after its surface states being adjusted, which might presage more possible applications of this material. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These materials were saturated with a poly(ammonium-4-styrene sulfonate) water soluble polymer and then carbonized at 1123 K. This process increases significantly the materials strength and density. A uniform deposition of the polymer-derived carbon on the external layers of the graphene sheets of the monolith was found. The carbon from polymer not only provided more contact between the graphene sheets but also apparently increased the overall graphitization level (based on Raman spectra). The modification decreased the electrical resistance by one order of magnitude compared to that of the graphene monolith. N<inf>2</inf> adsorption at 77 K showed that the thus-treated graphene monoliths have quite homogenous pores with the pore width of 0.7 nm. These pores, combined with large transport pores, and conductive properties make the monoliths tested the promising materials for separation, energy storage, and/or gas sensing. The tunability of the properties and pore structure of the robust graphene ultramicroporous monolith through the control of chemistry of the initial GO monolith was shown. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Surprisingly, even under mild tribological conditions, a tribo-induced hybridization change (sp3 towards sp2) can be clearly detected at the top of the coating resulting in the formation of a 40 nm thick amorphous sp2 rich carbon layer with embedded diamond nanoparticles less than 5 nm diameter. Classical molecular dynamics simulations of diamond single crystal asperity collisions can explain this finding. Tribochemical amorphization of the contact zone between the colliding diamond grains followed by fracture events at the asperity shoulders produces ultra-nanodiamonds that remain attached to the amorphous carbon phase. An additional atomistic sliding simulation of two ultra-nanocrystalline diamond coatings yields an amorphous sp2 rich carbon layer that grows at a rate that is comparable to corresponding layers on the softest diamond single crystal surfaces. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Focusing on the relationship between structural change and electrical and thermal properties, high-purity SWCNTs were fabricated using the water-assisted CVD method and treated at high temperatures (1500-2000 °C) in an argon atmosphere. We showed that the electrical and thermal properties of the SWCNTs were improved by ∼2.9 and 3.0, respectively, which required lower treatment temperatures than for multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs). In addition to the crystallinity improvement, the wall number and diameter increased with treatment temperature. When compared to as-grown SWCNTs of similar wall number and diameter, the heat treated SWCNTs exhibited higher electrical and thermal properties, which suggested that the property improvements could be attributed to not only to the wall number and diameter but also to the improvement in crystallinity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to evaluate the dynamic impact of FC and organic load on the generation of haloacetic acids (HAAs) and trihalomethanes (THMs) in simulated wash water. Lettuce juice was sequentially added into FC solution with FC periodically replenished. Water samples were collected after each lettuce juice addition to measure water qualities and determine HAAs and THMs using US-Environmental-Protection-Agency (EPA) methods. Concentrations of 88-2103 μg/l of total HAAs and 20.79-859.47 μg/l of total THMs were detected during the study. Monobromoacetic, tribromoacetic, chlorodibromoacetic and trichloroacetic acid were the major HAAs components. Chloroform (trichloromethane) was the primary THMs present. A significant correlation of HAAs with chemical oxygen demand and THMs with FC was observed. Results indicated that optimizing wash water sanitizing systems to limit organic matters and maintain minimal effective FC concentration is critical. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Free chlorine; Haloacetic acids; Organic loads; Trihalomethanes","Artes, F., Gomez, P., Aguayo, E., Escalona, V., Artes-Hernandez, F., Sustainable sanitation techniques for keeping quality and safety of fresh-cut plant commodities (2009) Postharvest Biology and Technology, 51, pp. 287-296; Connell, G., (1996) The chlorination/chloramination handbook, , American Water Works Association Denver, CO; Council directive 98/83/EC of 3 November 1998 on the quality of water intended for human consumption (1998) Official Journal of European Communities, 330 L., pp. 32-54; Gil, M.I., Selma, M.V., Lopez-Galvez, F., Villaescusa, R., Allende, A., Fresh-cut produce sanitation and wash water disinfection: Problems and solutions (2009) International Journal of Food Microbiology, 134, pp. 37-45; Gómez-López, V.M., Lannoo, A.-S., Gil, M.I., Allende, A., Minimum free chlorine residual level required for the inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and trihalomethane generation during dynamic washing of fresh-cut spinach (2014) Food Control, 42, pp. 132-138; Luo, Y., Nou, X., Millner, P., Zhou, B., Shen, C., Yang, Y., A pilot plant scale evaluation of a new process aid for enhancing chlorine efficacy against pathogen survival and cross-contamination during produce wash (2012) International Journal of Food Microbiology, 158, pp. 133-139; Rico, D., Martin-Diana, A.B., Barat, J.M., Barry-Ryan, C., Extending and measuring the quality of fresh-cut fruit and vegetables: A review (2007) Trends in Food Science and Technology, 18, pp. 373-386; Shen, C., Evaluation of chlorine efficacy against Escherichia coli O157:H7 survival and cross-contamination during continuous produces washing process with water quality change (2014) International Journal of Food Science, Nutrition and Dietetics, 3, pp. 1-5; Shen, C., Luo, Y., Nou, X., Wang, Q., Millner, P., Dynamic effects of free chlorine concentration, organic load, and exposure time on the inactivation of Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (2013) Journal Food Protection, 76, pp. 386-393; US-EPA, (1992) EPA method 524.2 measurement of purgeable organic compounds in water by capillary column gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, , http://water.epa.gov/scitech/methods/cwa/bioindicators/upload/2007_11_27_methods_method_524_2.pdf, Accessed 03.17.15; US-EPA, (2003) EPA method 552.3 determination of haloacetic acids and dalapon in drinking water by liquid-liquid microextraction, derivatization and gas chromatography with electron capture detection, , http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw/methods/pdfs/methods/met552_3.pdf, Accessed 03.17.15; US-EPA, (2009) National primary drinking water regulations, , http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/upload/mcl-2.pdf, Accessed 03.17.15; US-FDA, (2008) Commodity specific food safety guidelines for the fresh tomato supply chain, , http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/GuidanceRegulation/UCM171708.pdf, Accessed 03.17.15; US-FDA, (2009) Methods to reduce/eliminate pathogens from produce and fresh-cut produce, analysis and evaluation of preventive control measures for the control and reduction/elimination of microbial hazards on fresh and fresh-cut produce, , http://www.fda.gov/Food/ScienceResearch/ResearchAreas/SafePracticesforFoodProcesses/ucm091363.htm, Accessed 03.17.15; Van Hautev, S., Ampers, I., Holvoet, K., Uyttendaele, M., Physicochemical quality and chemical safety of chlorine as a reconditioning agent and wash water disinfect for fresh-cut lettuce washing (2013) Applied Environmental Microbiology, 79, pp. 2850-2861; White, G.C., (2010) White's handbook of chlorination and alternative disinfectants, , 5th ed.

In using solar energy, water, CO2 and mineral salts to produce a large amount of biomass for the food chain, cyanobacteria constitute the first biological barrier against the entry of toxics into the food chain. In addition, cyanobacteria have the potential for the solar-driven carbon-neutral production of biofuels. However, cyanobacteria are often challenged by toxic reactive oxygen species generated under intense illumination, i.e., when their production of photosynthetic electrons exceeds what they need for the assimilation of inorganic nutrients. Furthermore, in requiring high amounts of various metals for growth, cyanobacteria are also frequently affected by drastic changes in metal availabilities. They are often challenged by heavy metals, which are increasingly spread out in the environment through human activities, and constitute persistent pollutants because they cannot be degraded. Consequently, it is important to analyze the protection against oxidative and metal stresses in cyanobacteria because these ancient organisms have developed most of these processes, a large number of which have been conserved during evolution. This review summarizes what is known regarding these mechanisms, emphasizing on their crosstalk. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","Exopolysaccharides; Glutathione; Heavy metals; Oxidative stress; Regulation; Synechocystis; Transport systems","Schopf, W.J., The paleobiological record of photosynthesis (2011) Photosynth.

The aim of this study was to ascertain the nutritional composition and the content and profile of phenolic compounds of three edible flowers, monks cress (Tropaeolum majus), marigold (Tagetes erecta) and paracress (Spilanthes oleracea), and to determine the relationship between the presence of phenolic compounds and the antioxidant capacity. Proximate composition, total dietary fibre (TDF) and minerals were analysed according to official methods: total phenolic compounds (TPC) were determined with Folin-Ciocalteu’s reagent, whereas antioxidant capacity was evaluated using Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) assays. In addition, phenolic compounds were characterised by HPLC-DAD-MSn. In relation to the nutritional value, the edible flowers had a composition similar to that of other plant foods, with a high water and TDF content, low protein content and very low proportion of total fat—showing significant differences among samples. The levels of TPC compounds and the antioxidant capacity were significantly higher in T. erecta, followed by S. oleracea and T. majus. Thirty-nine different phenolic compounds were tentatively identified, with flavonols being the major compounds detected in all samples, followed by anthocyanins and hydroxycynnamic acid derivatives. In T. erecta small proportions of gallotannin and ellagic acid were also identified. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Edible flowers; HPLC-DAD-ESI/MSn; Nutritional value; ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity); Phenolic compounds; TEAC (trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity)","Kaisoon, O., Siriamornpun, S., Weerapreeyakul, N., Meeso, N., Phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities of edible flowers from Thailand (2011) J.

The core-shell structure of PA6/PPy NFM can be clearly proved under scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effects of initial solution pH and ionic strength, as well as the comparison of the adsorption capacity of functionalized (PA6/PPy NFM) and non-functionalized (PA6 NFM) adsorbent, were examined to reveal the possible adsorption mechanism. The results indicated that π-π interaction and electrostatic interaction should play a key role in the adsorption process. The kinetics and thermodynamics studies also further elucidated the detailed adsorption characteristics of atrazine removal by PA6/PPy NFM. The adsorption of atrazine could be well described by the pseudo-second-order equation. The adsorption equilibrium data was well fitted with the Freundlich isotherm model with a maximum adsorption capacity value of 14.8 mg/g. In addition, the increase of adsorption rate caused by a temperature increase could be felicitously explained by the endothermic reaction. The desorption results showed that the adsorption capacity remained almost unchanged after six adsorption/desorption cycles. These results suggest that PA6/PPy NFM could be employed as an efficient adsorbent for removing atrazine from contaminated water sources. © 2015, Yang et al.; licensee Springer.","Adsorption characteristics;

The efficacy of PDT depends on the local nanothermodynamic conditions near the cell/nanodrug system that control both the level of intracellular translocation of nanoparticles in the pathogenic cell and their agglomeration on the cell membrane. Dendrimers are considered one of the most effective and promising drug carriers because of their relatively low toxicity and negligible activation of complementary reactions. Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrite delivery of PDT agents has been investigated in the last few years for tumour selectivity, retention, pharmacokinetics and water solubility. Nevertheless, their use as drug carriers of photosensitizing molecules in PDT for cardiovascular disease, targeting the selective necrosis of macrophage cells responsible for atheromatous plaque growth, has never been investigated. Furthermore, the level of aggregation, translocation and nanodrug delivery efficacy of PAMAM dendrimers or PAMAM/zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) conjugates on human atheromatous tissue and endothelial cells is still unknown. In this work, the aggregation of PAMAM zero generation dendrimers (G0) acting as drug delivery carriers, as well as conjugated G0 PAMAM dendrimers with a ZnPc photosensitizer, to symptomatic and asymptomatic human carotid tissues was investigated by using atomic force microscopy (AFM). For the evaluation of the texture characteristics of the AFM images, statistical surface morphological and fractal analytical methodologies and Minkowski functionals were used. All statistical quantities showed that the deposition of nanodrug carriers on healthy tissue has an inverse impact when comparing to the deposition on atheromatous tissue with different aggregation features between G0 and G0/ZnPc nanoparticles and with considerably larger G0/ZnPc aggregations on the atheromatous plaque. The results highlight the importance of using PAMAM dendrimer carriers as a novel and promising PDT platform for atherosclerosis therapies. © 2015, Spyropoulos-Antonakakis et al.; licensee Springer.","AFM;

Furthermore, many studies only refer to one variety of maize. However, the few studies that include at least two varieties indicate that the respective choice will play a major role in how the yields will develop under a changing climate throughout the 21st century. This study will evaluate how far this choice of variety will affect future yields, identify the main factors to explain potential differences, and determine the magnitude of spatial variability. Results: The results suggest clearly differentiated development paths of all varieties. All varieties show a significant positive trend until the end of the century, though the medium variety also shows a significant decline of 5% during the first 30 years and only a slight recovery towards +5% around the century’s end. The late variety has the clearest and strongest positive trend, with peaks of more than +30% increase of biomass yields and around 25% average increase in the last three decades. The early variety can be seen as in-between, with no negative but also not an as-strong positive development path. All varieties have their strongest increase after the mid of the 21st century. Statistical evaluation of these results suggests that the shift from a summer rain to a winter rain climate in Germany will be the main limiting factor for all varieties. In addition, summer temperatures will become less optimal for all maize crops. As the data suggests, the increasing atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> concentrations will play a critical role in reducing the crops water uptake, thus enabling yield increases in the first place. Conclusions: This study clearly shows that maize yields will develop quite differently under the assumed climatic changes of the 21st century when different varieties are regarded. However, the predominant effect is positive for all discussed varieties and expected to be considerably stronger in the second half of the century. © 2015, Degener and Kappas; licensee Springer.","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Crop yield; Maize varieties; Summer drought","online statistical database, F.A.O.F.A.O., (2014) Rome. 04, 2, p. 2014. , http://faostat3.fao.org; DeStatis, (2013) Statistical Yearbook of Germany 2013, , Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbade; Homepage of the Chamber of Agricultre of Lower Saxony: homepage of the Chamber of Agricultre of Lower Saxony (2014) Oldenburg.

The influences of the alkali activator concentration, mineral composition of metakaolin, ratio of slag to slag + metakaolin, and concentration of NaNO3 on the cement performance were all evaluated in detail. The compressive strength of cemented nitrate solutions with AASC and AASMC aged for 28 days was from 13.4 to 42 MPa depending on the NaNO3 concentration. X-ray diffractometer, differential thermal analyzer, and electron microscope analyses suggested that NaNO3 crystallizes in cementitious matrices without reacting with the hydration products of AASC and AASMC. X-ray microtomography showed that the solidified NaNO3 solution with a salt concentration of 700 g/l and AASC had a denser microstructure without shrinkage microcracks, a smaller macropore volume, and smaller macropore sizes than hardened AASC-based paste mixed with water. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Such reductions will be of concern to forest managers looking to improve forest productivity during the establishment and initial growth phases of plantation-grown Pinus radiata D. Don. The objective of this research was to assess how growth, biomass, leaf area and water-use efficiency in juvenile Pinus radiata responded to the timing and duration of water deficits.Methods: Two-year-old Pinus radiata seedlings (cultivated in a polyhouse) were subjected to various water deficit treatments. Needle water potential, tree growth, biomass partitioning, leaf characteristics and water-use efficiency were measured to assess the impact that the timing and duration of water deficits had on productivity.Results: Cyclical re-watering of the early- and late-season drought treatments led to large fluctuations in needle water potential. The summer drought treatment resulted in a sustained low needle water potential over the summer months. Total water stress integral (S<inf>ψ</inf>) was 41.4, 66.8, 55.2 and 97.6 MPa-days for the well-watered, early-season cyclical drought, late-season cyclical drought and summer drought treatments, respectively. In general, water deficits decreased tree growth, reduced crown size, reduced biomass accumulation and leaf area, and resulted in more enriched values of δ13C, all of which were significantly (P < 0.05) affected by treatment. Summer drought reduced height, diameter and basal area by 24.7%, 33.1% and 52.3%, respectively. Total biomass was reduced by 64.7% and total leaf area by 40.0%, compared with the well-watered treatment. The reduction in stem diameter growth was larger for the late-season treatment than the early-season treatment when compared with the well-watered trees suggesting that late-season drought is more detrimental than early-season drought to tree growth.Conclusion: The results provide insight for forest managers of Pinus radiata into the importance of managing water deficits in order to maximise forest production of juvenile trees. Results suggest that late-season drought is more detrimental to absolute growth and biomass accumulation than early-season drought. © 2015, Waghorn et al.; licensee Springer.","Biomass; Clone; Growth; Leaf area; Pinus radiata; Productivity; Water deficits; Water stress; Water-use efficiency","Albaugh, T.J., Allen, H.L., Dougherty, P.M., Kress, L.W., King, J.S., Leaf area and above- and belowground growth responses of loblolly pine to nutrient and water additions (1998) Forest Science, 44, pp. 317-328; Allen, R.G., Pereira, L.S., Raes, D., Smith, M., (1998) Crop Evaporation - Guidelines for Computing Crop Water Requirements.

Catal. B 2012, 119-120, 49-55). With extension of previous study, a simple and effective technique of atmospheric-pressure cold plasma of humid air is explored for in-situ regeneration of Au nanocatalysts. In comparison with ineffective regeneration by dry plasma, humid plasma using synthetic air (20% O<inf>2</inf> balance N<inf>2</inf>) as discharge gas surprisingly exhibited effective regeneration performance over Au catalyst due to significant contribution of water vapor. After plasma regeneration for 5min, the regeneration degree of Au catalysts significantly increased up to 98% under humid plasma in presence of 2.77vol.% water, while decreased down to negative 29% under dry plasma. To disclose the mechanism of water vapor contribution to greatly improved regeneration degree, the characterizations of regenerated catalysts, and the analyses of electric discharge characteristics and gaseous products during the plasma regeneration were conducted. The significant contribution of water vapor embodies in that it speeds up the decomposition of carbonate species and simultaneously inhibits the formation of poisoning species of nitrogen oxides. Furthermore, normal air instead of synthetic air in humid plasma regeneration was implemented on the evaluations of the deactivated Au catalysts after a long-term reaction and during ten deactivation-regeneration cycles, which ensured the feasibility and reliability of in-situ plasma regeneration of Au nanocatalysts as a simple, effective and promising technique. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Air plasma; Au catalyst; CO oxidation; In-situ regeneration; Water vapor","Haruta, M., (2004) Gold bull., 37, pp. 27-36; Gong, J., (2011) Chem.

In this work, we present a novel ternary sensitizer miargyrite AgSbS<inf>2</inf> for optimized ZnO, and the ZnO/AgSbS<inf>2</inf> nanoarrays film was applied on photoelectrochemical (PEC) photoelectrodes. Strikingly, the photocurrent density of this electrode was up to 5.08 mA cm-2 at 0.096V versus Ag/AgCl. The excellent PEC properties stems from the enhanced absorption spectrum, high speed of photo-induced charges transmission velocity and appropriate energy gap of coupled nanostructures.

However, consumption of caloric beverages (CB) has increased considerably worldwide. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the association between CB and PW intake in Mexican adults with a low socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: In a cross-sectional design, beverage consumption was evaluated with a 24-h beverages recall using the five-step multiple-pass method recommended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Physical activity, anthropometric and sociodemographic information were obtained. CB was defined as those beverages that provide energy, with the exception of low-fat milk and beverages with noncaloric sweeteners. Participants were classified into five groups according to their PW consumption (nondrinkers and four quartiles). Differences between groups were evaluated with ANOVA and Bonferroni tests for multiple comparisons among quartiles. A two-stage Heckman regression model was designed with robust standard errors, adjusting for potential confounders. Results: A total of 1108 adults between 21 and 59 years of age were evaluated. A negative association was noted between PW intake and CB consumption (p <0.001) with the exception of natural juice, which was positive (p <0.01) and sodas that no differences were found between quartiles. Specifically, for every milliliter of PW, the intake of CB was 3.4, 1.3, 0.68 and 0.38 mL in each quartile, respectively (p <0.001). In Heckman's model, PW consumers were 0.5 times less likely to consume CB (p = 0.029). This probability increased to 0.9 for low-fat milk, skim milk and beverages without added sugar (LFM-BWAS) consumers (p <0.001). Also, for every 100 mL of PW consumption, CB intake diminished by 20 mL (p <0.001). In turn, for every 100 mL of LFM-BWAS consumption, a reduction of 47 mL in CB was observed (p <0.001). Conclusions: Higher PW consumption was associated with lower CB consumption. This association suggests that future studies are warranted to determine if increasing PW intake in a low SES Mexican population can reduce intake of CB. © 2015 Illescas-Zarate et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Adults;

The whole three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) procedure is performed in a completely open-source way. Blender, enGrid, OpenFOAM and ParaView are employed for geometry creation, mesh generation, case simulation and post process, respectively. Original solver ‘buoyantBoussinesqSimpleFoam’ is selected for the present study, and a temperature-dependent solver ‘buoyantBoussinesqSimpleTDFoam’ is developed to ensure the simulation is more realistic. The two solvers are used for same cases and compared to corresponding experimental results. The flow regime in these cases is laminar (Reynolds number is 150) and the Rayleigh number range is 0.7 × 107 ~ 5 × 107. By comparison, the average natural Nusselt numbers of water and Al2O3/water nanofluids are found to increase with the Rayleigh number. At the same Rayleigh number, the Nusselt number is found to decrease with nanofluid volume fraction. The temperature-dependent solver is found better for water and 1% Al2O3/water nanofluid cases, while the original solver is better for 4% Al2O3/water nanofluid cases. Furthermore, due to strong three-dimensional flow features in the horizontal cylinder, three-dimensional CFD simulation is recommended instead of two-dimensional simplifications. © 2015, Meng and Li; licensee Springer.","Nanofluid; Natural heat convection; OpenFOAM; Temperature-dependent solver","Report number: ANL/MSD/CP-84938; CONF-951135-29 ON: DE96004174 (1995) TRN, 96 (1707); Li, Y., Zhou, J., Tung, S., Schneider, E., Xi, S., A review on development of nanofluid preparation and characterization (2009) Powder Technol, 196 (2), pp. 89-101; Jacopo, B., David, C., Venerusetal: A benchmark study on the thermal conductivity of nanofluids (2009) Journal of Applied Physics, 106, p. 094312; Lazarus Godson, B., Raja, D., Mohan Lal, S., Wongwises: Enhancement of heat transfer using nanofluids - an overview (2010) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 14 (2), pp. 629-641; Ghadimi, A., Saidur, R., Metselaar, H.S.C., A review of nanofluid stability properties and characterization in stationary conditions (2011) Int J Heat Mass Transf., 54, pp. 4051-4068; Nsofor, C.E., Recent patents on nanofluids (nanoparticles in liquids) heat transfer (2008) Recent Patents Mechan Eng, 1 (3), pp. 190-197; Ostrach, S., Natural convection in enclosures (1988) J Heat Transf, 110 (4b), pp. 1175-1190; Wang, X.-Q., Mujumdar, A.S., A review on nanofluids - part 2: experiments and applications (2008) Braz J Chem Eng, 25 (4), pp. 631-648; Sarkar, J., A critical review on convective heat transfer correlations of nanofluids (2011) Renew Sust Energ Rev., 15, pp. 3271-3277; Kamyar, A., Saidur, R., Hasanuzzaman, M., Application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for nanofluids (2012) Int J Heat Mass Transf., 55, pp. 4104-4115; Haddad, Z., Oztop, H.F., Abu-Nada, E., Mataoui, A., A review on natural convective heat transfer of nanofluids (2012) Renew Sust Energ Rev, 16 (7), pp. 5363-5378; Putra, N., Roetzel, W., Das, S.K., Natural convection of nano-fluids (2003) Heat Mass Transf, 39 (8-9), pp. 775-784; Wen, D., Ding, Y., Formulation of nanofluids for natural convective heat transfer applications (2005) Int J Heat Fluid Flow, 26 (6), pp. 855-864; Li, C.H., Peterson, G.P., Experimental studies of natural convection heat transfer of Al2O3/DI water nanoparticle suspensions (nanofluids) (2010) Advances in Mechanical Engineering, Article ID, p. 742739; Rui, N., Sheng-Qi, Z., Ke-Qing, X., An experimental investigation of turbulent thermal convection in water-based alumina nanofluid (2011) Physics of Fluids, 23, p. 022005; Nnanna, A.G.A., Experimental model of temperature-driven nanofluid (2007) J Heat Transf, 129 (6), pp. 697-704; Ho, C.J., Liu, W.K., Chang, Y.S., Lin, C.C., Natural convection heat transfer of alumina-water nanofluid in vertical square enclosures: an experimental study (2010) Int J Therm Sci, 49 (8), pp. 1345-1353; Bresme, F., Oettel, M., Nanoparticles at fluid interfaces (2007) J Physics-Condense Matter., 19, p. 413101; Lervik, A., Bresme, F., Kjelstrup, S., Heat transfer in soft nanoscale interfaces: the influence of interface curvature (2009) Soft Matter., 12, pp. 2407-2414; Eliodoro, C., Pietro, A., Enhancing surface heat transfer by carbon nanofins: towards an alternative to nanofluids?

CIS/ZnS NCs were facilely synthesized via a stepwise, consecutive hybrid flow reactor approach. To stabilize the optical properties of hydrophobic CIS/ZnS NCs, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was chosen as a matrix for aqueous phase transfer. As the result, a high quantum yield (QY) of 56.0% and excellent photostability were acquired in aqueous media. For removing excessive surfactants, cold treatment (4°C) of the CTAB-water solution was adopted to prevent further agglomeration of CIS/ZnS NCs, which could secure high stability over 6 months (less 2% reduction in QY). The optical features and structure of the obtained CTAB stabilized CIS/ZnS (CTAB-CIS/ZnS) NCs have been characterized by UV–vis and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies, XRD, XPS, EDX, and TEM. The high stability and PL of water soluble CTAB-CIS/ZnS NCs suggest their potential in nanoelectronics and bioapplications. © 2015, Lee and Han; licensee Springer.","Cold treatment; CTAB; CuInS2/ZnS nanocrystals;

Environmental land use conflicts were set up on the basis of land use and land capability maps, coded as follows: 1 - agriculture, 2 - pasture, 3 - pasture/forest, and 4 - forest. Land capability was assessed by the ruggedness number methodology (RN). The difference between the codes of capability and use defines a conflict class, where a negative or null value means no conflict and a positive value means class i conflict. Within and without the conflict areas, ecological quality of surface water was evaluated by the metrics EPT taxa, IPtIN index, diversity of Shannon-Wiener and Evenness index. Macroinvertebrate communities are strongly correlated to conflict classes, because sites without (reference sites) or with minor physicochemical and hydromorphological degradation (Class 1) presented high diversity, evenness, EPT taxa and IPtIN index, while more impacted sites (Class 2) presented an ecological status not fulfilling the demands of the European Union Water Framework Directive (2000/60). The present study indicates a significant impact of land use on water quality which has straight influence on the distribution of biota, emphasizing the key role of riparian vegetation in the conservation of aquatic ecosystems. The highest impacts on macroinvertebrate assemblages were associated with changes in water quality parameters such as temperature, oxygen saturation (%), turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), nitrates, phosphates and sulphates, conductivity and dissolved oxygen, as well as hydromorphological alterations driven by the total absence of riparian vegetation as a consequence of terrace building, agriculture and the resectioning/reinforcement of the banks associated with the culture of vine. Macroinvertebrates proved reliable to distinguish conflict classes and separate seasons. The main conservation measures required to improve the conflict areas in the short and medium term mainly include the adoption of agroforestry practices as these not only improve the quality of water and soil, maintaining land resources over a long period of use, but also brings many benefits to the landowner. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Environmental degradation; Land capability; Macroinvertebrates; Water quality","Abdala, V.L., (2012) Diagnóstico hídrico do rio Uberaba - MG como subsídio para a gestão das áreas de conflito ambiental, p. 64. , (Ph.D. in Agronomy), State University of São Paulo.

In this work, hollow α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> nanofibers made of rice-like nanorods were successfully synthesized via a simple hydrothermal reaction on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofiber template followed by calcination. The crystallographic structure and the morphology of the as-prepared α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> nanofibers were characterized by X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, and scanning electron microscope. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted, and ultraviolet-visible spectra were recorded before and after the adsorption to investigate the dye adsorption performance. The results showed that hollow α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> fiber assembles exhibited good magnetic responsive performance, as well as efficient adsorption for methyl orange in water.

Both organic and inorganic thin films can be deposited by ALD with a variety of precursors. In this work, the performances of Al2O3 thin films and Al2O3/alucone hybrid films have been investigated. The samples with a 50 nm Al2O3 inorganic layer deposited by ALD at a low temperature of 80°C showed higher surface roughness (0.503 ± 0.011 nm), higher water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) values (3.77 × 10−4 g/m2/day), and lower transmittance values (61%) when compared with the Al2O3 (inorganic)/alucone (organic) hybrid structure under same conditions. Furthermore, a bending test upon single Al2O3 layers showed an increased WVTR of 1.59 × 10−3 g/m2/day. However, the film with a 4 nm alucone organic layer inserted into the center displayed improved surface roughness, barrier performance, and transmittance. After the bending test, the hybrid film with 4 nm equally distributed alucone maintained better surface roughness (0.339 ± 0.014 nm) and barrier properties (9.94 × 10−5 g/m2/day). This interesting phenomenon reveals that multilayer thin films consisting of inorganic layers and decentralized alucone organic components have the potential to be useful in TFE applications on flexible optical electronics. © 2015, Xiao et al.;

Silver nanoparticle (Agnano) coatings on filtration membranes can prevent bacterial adhesion and the initiation of biofilm formation. In this study, Agnano are immobilized via direct reduction on porous zirconia capillary membranes to generate a nanocomposite material combining the advantages of ceramics being chemically, thermally and mechanically stable with nanosilver, an efficient broadband bactericide for water decontamination. The filtration of bacterial suspensions of the fecal contaminant Escherichia coli reveals highly efficient bacterial retention capacities of the capillaries of 8 log reduction values, fulfilling the requirements on safe drinking water according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Maximum bacterial loading capacities of the capillary membranes are determined to be 3 × 109 bacterial cells/750 mm2 capillary surface until back flushing is recommendable. The immobilized Agnano remain accessible and exhibit strong bactericidal properties by killing retained bacteria up to maximum bacterial loads of 6 × 108 bacterial cells/750 mm2 capillary surface and the regenerated membranes regain filtration efficiencies of 95-100%. Silver release is moderate as only 0.8% of the initial silver loading is leached during a three-day filtration experiment leading to average silver contaminant levels of 100 μg/L. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Bactericide membrane surface; Ceramic capillary membrane; Immobilized silver nanoparticles; Macroporous; Silver leaching","Beloin, C., Roux, A., Ghigo, J.M., Escherichia coli biofilms (2008) Curr.

Groundwater without any treatment is the predominant source of drinking water by inhabitants of these communities. However, the quality of this water source is not immediately known, raising questions of its safety. Results of a regional composite of groundwater obtained, shows high iron (27%) and zinc (36%) contents in Boji-Boji Agbor area, manganese (31%) was highest in Boji-Boji Owa. Alihame recorded the lowest value of zinc (8%), while manganese was lowest in Agbor Obi area (12%). Arsenic, cadmium, and chromium were below detection limit in all the sample sites. Correlational matrix analysis revealed no significant relationships between metal types studied. Analyses of chronic daily dose intake (CDI), and hazard index were all very low. A hazard index of 0.01 was obtained. One-way ANOVA show significant statistical difference in the mean concentrations of the heavy metals for the different sample sites, which indicate that different sites contribute differently to the mean concentrations of the groundwater in the study area. Four conclusions are drawn from this study. Indications are that the heavy metals present in the Nigerian aquifer are very much below the maximum concentration levels and guideline values of national and WHO standards. Secondly, there is a heavier load of these metals in the city centre than in the suburbs; with Boji-Boji area Agbor/Owa urban areas accounting for 27 and 20 percent of load respectively. Thirdly, the below detection limit results for some of the metal ions and the very low concentrations of those detected are pointers to the absence of industrial activities and mining. Finally, the groundwater in the study area is considered to be generally safe with respect to the contaminants studied and results posted for the composite samples. Inhabitants are therefore under no illusion of immediate or remote health challenges with regards to the heavy metals analyzed. More individual sampling, however, is recommended. © 2015, Oyem et al.; licensee Springer.","Boji-Boji area; Chronic daily intake; Ground water; Guideline value; Hazard Index; Heavy metals","Ahaneku, I.E., Adeoye, P.A., Impact of pit laterines on groundwater quality of Fokoslum, Ibadan, Southwestern Nigeria (2014) Brit J of Appl Sci and Tech, 4 (3), pp. 440-449; APHA, (2005) Standard Methods for Water and Wastewater, , American Public Health Association, Washington, D.C:; Avwunudiogba, A., A comparative analysis of soil and nutrient losses on maize plant with different tillage practices in Ikpoba River basin of south-western Nigeria (2000) Niger Geogrhc J New Series, 3 (4), pp. 199-208; Bresline, E., Sustainable water supply in developing countries.

The results revealed for the first time the high antioxidant activity of sterilized yacon flour. The best extract obtained by boiling 8.9% (w/v) of yacon flour in deionised water for 10 min exhibited a total antioxidant capacity of 222 ± 2 mg (ascorbic acid equivalent)/100 g DW and a total polyphenol content of 275 ± 3 mg (gallic acid equivalent)/100 g DW associated to the presence of four main phenolic compounds: chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, coumaric acid and protocatechuic acid, as well as the amino acid tryptophan. The most abundant was chlorogenic acid, followed by caffeic acid. Biological assays revealed that the extract had indeed antioxidant protection, and no pro-oxidant activity. In conclusion, sterilized yacon tuber flour has the potential to be used in the food industry as a food ingredient to produce functional food products. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Antioxidant;

This strategy calls for the first preparation of metal complexes between RE precursors and dodecylamine (DDA) in water/ethanol mixture at room temperature and subsequent thermal decomposition at elevated temperature. The influence of reaction time and water/ethanol volume ratios on the morphology and size of as-prepared RE hydroxides are investigated. CeO2 nanoparticles with spherical shape could be directly obtained by hydrothermal treatment of complexes formed between Ce precursors and DDA. In addition, by further calcinating the RE hydroxides at high temperature in air, RE oxide nanorods could be readily produced. © 2015, Li et al. ; licensee Springer.","Hydrothermal; Hydroxide; Nanorod; Oxide; Rare earth","Shen, J., Sun, L.-D., Yan, C.-H., Luminescent rare earth nanomaterials for bioprobe applications (2008) Dalton Trans., 42, pp. 5687-5697; Zhou, Z., Hu, H., Yang, H., Yi, T., Huang, K., Yu, M., Up-conversion luminescent switch based on photochromic diarylethene and rare-earth nanophosphors (2008) Chem Commun., 39, pp. 4786-4788; Si, R., Flytzani-Stephanopoulos, M., Shape and crystal-plane effects of nanoscale ceria on the activity of Au-CeO2 catalysts for the water-gas shift reaction (2008) Angew Chem Int Ed., 47, pp. 2884-2887; Mele, P., Artini, C., Ubaldini, A., Costa, G.A., Carnasciali, M.M., Masini, R., Synthesis, structure and magnetic properties in the Nd2O3–Gd2O3 mixed system synthesized at 1200°C (2009) J Phys Chem Solids., 70, pp. 276-280; Yamada, Y., Segawa, M., Sato, F., Kojima, T., Sato, S., Catalytic performance of rare earth oxides in ketonization of acetic acid (2011) J Mol Catal A: Chem., 346, pp. 79-86; Gai, S., Li, C., Yang, P., Lin, J., Recent progress in rare earth micro/nanocrystals: soft chemical synthesis, luminescent properties, and biomedical applications (2014) Chem Rev., 114, pp. 2343-2389; Sinclair, A., Rodgers, J.A., Topping, C.V., Míšek, M., Stewart, R.D., Kockelmann, W., Synthesis and properties of lanthanide ruthenium(III) oxide perovskites (2014) Angew Chem Int Ed., 53, pp. 8343-8347; Zhao, Y.-L., Song, Y.-L., Song, W.-G., Liang, W., Jiang, X.-Y., Tang, Z.-Y., Progress of nanoscience in China (2014) Front Phys., 9, pp. 257-288; Yan, Z.-G., Yan, C.-H., Controlled synthesis of rare earth nanostructures (2008) J Mater Chem., 18, pp. 5046-5059; Wang, X., Li, Y., Synthesis and characterization of lanthanide hydroxide single-crystal nanowires (2002) Angew Chem Int Ed., 41, pp. 4790-4793; Song, X.C., Zheng, Y.F., Wang, Y., Selected-control synthesis of dysprosium hydroxide and oxide nanorods by adjusting hydrothermal temperature (2008) Mater Res Bull., 43, pp. 1106-1111; Xu, Z., Li, C., Yang, P., Zhang, C., Huang, S., Lin, J., Rare earth fluorides nanowires/nanorods derived from hydroxides: hydrothermal synthesis and luminescence properties (2009) Cryst Growth Res., 9, pp. 4752-4758; Wang, P., Bai, B., Huang, L., Hu, S., Zhuang, J., Wang, X., General synthesis and characterization of a family of layered lanthanide (Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd) hydroxide nanowires (2011) Nanoscale., 3, pp. 2529-2535; Zhang, X., Yang, P., Wang, D., Xu, J., Li, C., Gai, S., La(OH)3:Ln3+ and La2O3:Ln3+ (Ln = Yb/Er, Yb/Tm, Yb/Ho) microrods: synthesis and up-conversion luminescence properties (2012) Cryst Growth Des., 12, pp. 306-312; Song, Y., You, H., Huang, Y., Yang, M., Zheng, Y., Zhang, L., Highly uniform and monodisperse Gd2O2S:Ln3+ (Ln = Eu, Tb) submicrospheres: solvothermal synthesis and luminescence properties (2010) Inorg Chem., 49, pp. 11499-11504; Yang, J., Sargent, E.H., Kelley, S.O., Ying, J.Y., A general phase-transfer protocol for metal ions and its application in nanocrystal synthesis (2009) Nat Mater., 8, pp. 683-689; Zhang, N., Yi, R., Zhou, L., Gao, G., Shi, R., Qiu, G., Lanthanide hydroxide nanorods and their thermal decomposition to lanthanide oxide nanorods (2009) Mater Chem Phys., 114, pp. 160-167; Seitz, M., Oliver, A.G., Raymond, K.N., The lanthanide contraction revisited (2007) J Am Chem Soc., 129, pp. 11153-11160; Xin, Y., Wang, Z., Qi, Y., Zhang, Z., Zhang, S., Synthesis of rare earth (Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu and Gd) hydroxide and oxide nanorods (nanobundles) by a widely applicable precipitation route (2010) J Alloy Compd., 507, pp. 105-111; Vekilov, P.G., What determines the rate of growth of crystals from solution?

Irrigation by flooding provides this crop with particular characteristics, including at harvest, when it causes difficulties for machinery traffic due to the high soil water content. In addition to this, a large amount of green material is left on the soil, which if not burned, a practice which is prohibited or in the process thereof in many countries, impedes later work to the point where over 600 to 800. kg/ha affects establishment of rice in the following season. The above is complicated by the use of direct sowing (DS), which achieves positive results, both in lowering costs and recovering soil, although there is no knowledge of how the planosol soils in Corrientes Province, Argentina, behave under these traffic conditions. The main objectives of this study were to: a) Find out how tools can be used best for improving decomposition of residue from harvesting rice grown under DS and their impact on soil compaction, and b) determine, for short periods, the amount of rice straws deposited on the surface and its decomposition time with various management techniques. A split plot with main factor arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replicates was performed. The use of harvester without spreader, harvester with rubber-flailed spreader, and harvester with metal-flailed spreader was assessed as the main factor. Additionally, three decomposition methods of rice straw were studied as split factor: passing a roller crimper over rice straw, control weed of rice straw with stubble chopper, and burning rice straw. The main results were: a) The harvester without spreader deposited more material in the center of the tail (21.680. kg/ha) decreasing toward the sides, and b) distribution done by the harvester with metal-flailed spreader was somewhat similar to the harvester with rubber-flailed spreader but with slightly less uniform deposits. The main conclusions were: 1) When planosol soil was trafficked with loads of 152.5. kN, the cone index increased in the subsoil, affecting next growing season, 2) management alternatives that left residue cover attenuated soil compaction caused by the harvester traffic, and 3) the use of a stubble chopper or roller crimper on the rice straw distributed by the harvesters with rubber-flailed or metal-flailed spreaders produced acceleration in decomposition. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Bearing capacity; Machinery traffic; Rice harvest; Soil sustainability","Alakukku, L., Subsoil loosening by mechanical and biological process (1998) Soil Tillage and Biology, NJF Seminar, Agricultural University of Norway, p. 286; Arronratana, U., Boangai, S., Bridge, L., (1972) Soil physical problems associated with crop diversifications in the Central Plain of Thailand, pp. 1-9. , International Rice Commission; ASAE, Standards, Soil cone penetrometer S 313.2 (1992) Am.

Glycol chitosan (G-CHI) was used as the capping ligand aiming to improve the water solubility of the nanoconjugates to produce stable and biocompatible colloidal systems. UV-visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to characterise the synthesis and the relative stability of biopolymer-capped semiconductor nanocrystals. The results clearly demonstrated that the glycol chitosan derivative was remarkably effective at nucleating and stabilising semiconductor CdS quantum dots in aqueous suspensions under acidic, neutral, and alkaline media with an average size of approximately 2.5 nm and a fluorescent activity in the visible range of the spectra. © 2015, Mansur and Mansur; licensee Springer.","78.67.Hc; 81.07.Ta; 82.35.Pq","Mansur, H.S., Quantum dots and nanocomposites (2010) WIRES Nanomeb Nanobi, 2, pp. 113-129; Medintz, I., Uyeda, E.L., Goodman, E.R., Mattousi, H., Goodman ER, Mattousi H.

Our FTIR spectroscopy-based studies for the molecular structure of the materials obtained suggest some interaction of their components in the hybrid layer. The influence of adsorption of water molecules on the conductivity and capacitance of the hybrid composites has been investigated in the temperature range of 20°C to 40°C. We have detected essential changes in the electrical conductivity and capacitance which depend on the humidity of the surrounding atmosphere. For estimating the sensing properties of our composites, we have analyzed the sensing abilities of the hybrid systems and their dynamic characteristics. The hybrid composites as working materials for the sensors provide improved performance of the latter. In particular, the response time is reduced by 3 to 5 times.

Box 518, Rafsanjan, Iran","Soil physical quality indicators (SPQIs) are used to make complex information more accessible to decision makers; however, their site-specific nature may restrict their applicability only to a specific soil type and/or management system. Therefore, it would be advantageous if such indicators could be predicted indirectly from easily available soil properties using inexpensive methods. In this study, we introduce a hybrid algorithm, specifically designed to work with optimized decision tree with particle swarm optimization (PSO-DT), for the prediction of SPQIs (i.e., air capacity, AC; plant-available water capacity, PAWC; and relative field capacity, RFC). The potential power of using the PSO-DT algorithm in setting up a framework for identifying the most determinant parameters affecting the physical quality of agricultural soils in a semiarid region of Iran (Baft plain, 29° 11' to 29° 13' N and 56° 34' to 56° 38' E) was also investigated. An empirical multiple linear regression (MLR) model was constructed as benchmark for the comparison of performance. In results, a permutation of five input features, including soil organic matter (SOM), electrical conductivity (EC), clay, sand, and bulk density (BD), was introduced by the hybrid PSO-DT algorithm as explanatory variables. Using the PSO-DT method resulted in higher model efficiency and coefficient of determination (R2) than the MLR approach. The obtained R2 values for the constructed PSO-DT model for the AC, PAWC, and RFC predictions were 0.91, 0.90, and 0.96, respectively, whereas they were 0.61, 0.16, and 0.47 for the MLR-model. The SOM, clay, and sand parameters were accounted as the discriminating variables of the models constructed for the prediction of AC, PAWC, and RFC indicators, respectively. This study provides a strong basis for the prediction of SPQIs and identifying the most determinant parameters influencing the physical quality of agricultural soils in semiarid regions of Iran; however, its general analytical framework could be applied to other parts of the world with similar challenges. © 2015.","Decision tree; Modeling; Particle swarm optimization; Soil physical quality indicators; Sustainable productivity","Abraham, A., Jain, R., Thomas, J., Han, S.Y., D-SCIDS: distributed soft computing intrusion detection system (2007) J.

These numerical solutions are computationally very intensive, and may not provide the insights that are possible from simpler analytical representations. In this study, temporal moments of solute transport for unsteady unsaturated flows under rainfall conditions at the soil surface are presented for the first time. A local-scale model for water movement is derived from a sharp front approximation and is combined with a model for transport of solute particles along the main characteristics of the flow field. Expressions for travel times from the local-scale model are first presented for pre- and post-ponding conditions. These local solutions are upscaled to field-scale solute transport by adopting a log-normally distributed spatial hydraulic conductivity field. Semi-analytical expressions are developed for temporal moments of travel times. These expressions are compared to 1-D Monte Carlo simulation results, and to 3-D numerical results for model corroboration. The model is used to investigate the behavior of macroscopic Eulerian effective velocities and dispersion at the field-scale. Expressions for asymptotic effective properties show that effective velocity achieves a constant value while effective dispersion increases linearly with depth. The roles of pre-ponding and post-ponding conditions in determining field-scale dispersion are described. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Infiltration; Sharp-front models; Solute transport; Temporal moments; Upscaling","Bresler, E., Dagan, G., Unsaturated flow in spatially variable fields, 3, application of water flow models to various fields (1983) Water Resour.

The intercalation of oleate anions led to extremely expanded interlayer distances (up to approximately 5.2 nm) of the LRH crystals and accordingly disordered stacking of the ab planes along the c-axis and also weakened interlayer interactions, without significantly damaging the ab plane. As a consequence, the thickness of the LRH crystals increased from approximately 1 to 10 μm, exhibiting a behavior similar to that observed from the smectite clay in water. Highly [111]-oriented and approximately 100-nm thick oxide films of (Y0.96TbxEu0.04-x)2O3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.04) have been obtained through spin-coating of the exfoliated colloidal nanosheets on quartz substrate, followed by annealing at 800°C.

Methods: I set up seed traps and took seed samples in three unflooded forests (terra firme, white sand-varillal, palm) and three white-water flooded forests (high restinga, low restinga, tahaumpa) in Peru over a period of one year. Results: I found (1) all forest types had dispersed seed of many unique species, with a few species in common, (2) total seed load peaked in the early part of the year – near the end of the rainy season – and then decreased monotonically over the remainder of the year for all forest types, (3) species richness was greater in unflooded forests compared to flooded forests and the largest number of species were found in terra firme, (4) seeds were more evenly distributed among species in the unflooded forests compared to the flooded forests, and (5) Fisher’s α diversity of seeds was greater in high and low restinga compared to tahaumpa. Conclusions: I conclude for the unflooded forests that seed species number and richness increased with soil fertility but for the flooded forests seed species number and richness decreased with months under water. Furthermore, when taken together, results suggest that for forests across the Amazonian landscape differences in flooding regime may have a greater effect on both seed rain load and seed species richness than differences in availability of soil nutrients. © 2015, Myster; licensee Springer.","High restinga; Low restinga; Palm; Tahuampa; Terra firme; White sand","Dalling, J.W., Hubbell, S.P., Silvera, K., Seed dispersal, seedling establishment and gap partitioning among tropical pioneer trees (1998) Journal of Ecology, 86, pp. 674-689; Dalling, J.W., Mueller-Landau, H.C., Wright, S.J., Hubbell, S.P., Role of dispersal in the recruitment limitation of Neotropical Pioneer species (2002) Journal of Ecology, 90, pp. 714-727; Daly, D.C., Prance, G.T., (1989) Brazilian Amazon, pp. 401-426. , In Floristic inventory of tropical countries.

A present-day situation is examined. It describes the widespread adoption of a granite tempered water jar by two social communities of potters who used to produce distinct ranges of morpho-functional vessels. The analysis of the transmission mechanisms shows that diffusion of such traits occurred both through indirect and direct transmission. Indirect transmission occurred at the inter-group level while direct transmission under the form of technical guidance occurred at the intra-group level. These were triggered by the intention of the artisans to produce a model valued by the consumers and which sells well. This intention took place in a context of collapse of the previous economic system. These results suggest that in a context where ceramic production was previously diversified and economically complementary, the standardization of morpho-functional traits signals that an established «rule» was transgressed and therefore that major socio-economic changes took place. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Diffusion; Ethno-archaeology; India; Pottery; Social boundary; Standardization; Transmission","Arnold, D.E., Does the standardization of ceramic pastes really mean specialization?

PEDOT polymer was electrochemically coated over a quantum dot-sensitized semiconductor and efficiently suppressed the back electron transfer from the semiconductor, thereby improving the photocurrent as compared to the uncoated control (13 vs 6mA/cm2, respectively). Impedance analysis revealed that the PEDOT-coated quantum dot electrode had reduced recombination resistance and increased electron lifetime values. Notably, the prepared electrode showed outstanding performance under visible-light irradiation in the absence of applied bias potential. Under this condition, the hybrid electrode structure generated hydrogen at a rate of 370μmolcm-2 h-1 with a sacrificial electrolyte. Furthermore, a quantum efficiency of 6.9% and turnover number of 2210 were achieved by the PEDOT-coated electrode. The photo-stability test revealed that the PEDOT polymer coated electrode showed longer stability compared to the uncoated electrode. The findings presented in this report highlight the advantages of designing and constructing the hybrid electrode structure and be applicable to other photocatalytic materials and photoelectrochemical reactions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Hydrogen production; Photo-electrochemistry; Polymer coating; Quantum dots; Solar energy conversion","Walter, M.G., Warren, E.L., McKone, J.R., Boettcher, S.W., Mi, Q.X., Santori, E.A., Lewis, N.S., (2010) Chem.

We asked if UD can accurately estimate U<inf>osm</inf> both in healthy subjects and in different clinical scenarios of kidney disease. Methods: UD was assessed by refractometry. U<inf>osm</inf> was measured by freezing point depression in spot urines obtained from healthy volunteers (N = 97) and in 319 inpatients with acute kidney injury (N = 95), primary glomerulophaties (N = 118) or chronic kidney disease (N = 106). Results: UD and U<inf>osm</inf> correlated in all groups (p < 0.05). However, a wide range of U<inf>osm</inf> values was associated with each UD value. When UD was ≤ 1.010, 28.4% of samples had U<inf>osm</inf> above 350 mOsm/kg. Conversely, in 61.6% of samples with UD above 1.020, U<inf>osm</inf> was below 600 mOsm/kg. As expected, U<inf>osm</inf> exhibited a strong relationship with serum creatinine (S<inf>creat</inf> ), whereas a much weaker correlation was found between UD and S<inf>creat</inf>. Conclusion: We found that UD is not a substitute for U<inf>osm</inf>. Although UD was significantly correlated with U<inf>osm</inf>, the wide dispersion makes it impossible to use UD as a dependable clinical estimate of U<inf>osm</inf>. Evaluation of the renal concentrating ability should be based on direct determination of U<inf>osm</inf>. © 2015 Souza et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Kidney disease; Urinalysis; Urine concentrating ability; Urine density; Urine osmolality","Czernichow, P., Polak, M., (2011) Testing Water Regulation, 1. , 4th ed.

In this study, CO<inf>2</inf> hydrogenation over composite catalysts comprised of Cu-Zn-Al oxide catalyst and HB zeolite was examined for the synthesis of C<inf>2+</inf> hydrocarbons by the combination of methanol synthesis over Cu-Zn-Al oxide and concurrent conversion of methanol over HB zeolite. When a non-modified zeolite was used for the composite catalyst, the yield of C<inf>2+</inf> hydrocarbons was poor (<0.5C-mol%), which was lower than that of oxygenated compounds (methanol and dimethyl ether). The strong acid sites of zeolite for the transformation of dimethyl ether to C<inf>2+</inf> hydrocarbons were seriously deactivated. The employment of zeolites modified with 1,4-bis(hydroxydimethylsilyl) benzene remarkably improved the catalytic activity of the corresponding composite catalysts to produce C<inf>2+</inf> hydrocarbons in yields of more than 7C-mol%. The best yield of C<inf>2+</inf> hydrocarbons became approximately 12.6C-mol% under a pressure of 0.98MPa. The disilane modification produced hydrophobic zeolites showing water contact angles more than 130°. The disilane compound was converted to some condensed aromatics during CO<inf>2</inf> hydrogenation at 300°C, and the hydrophobicity was maintained even after the reaction.

Probe 6 showed good optical behavior in acetonitrile and upon interaction with different metal ions and anions displayed strong fluorescence quenching (∼87%; switch-Off) with Cu2+ while remained silent toward the tested anions, respectively. Moreover, 6-Cu2+ ensemble when tested toward different anions only fluoride (F-) enable copper displacement (as CuF2) and led to fluorescence enhancement (switched-On). Probe 6 has selectively detected Cu2+ in real water sample, and on cellulose paper strips. Additionally, the naked eye sensitive ""On-Off-On"" sensing behavior of 6 mimics the function of a sequential logic circuit at molecular level.

Resistance and resilience, measured as amplitude and frequency of oscillations in bacterial communities after a disturbance, were suggested as integral indicators of soil health, but until now there is little proof for this hypothesis. In this study, resistance and resilience of microbial communities and 24 soil chemical and biological parameters were analyzed and correlated to suppression of flax wilt (caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lini) in three experiments. Soil samples were collected on three different dates from a recently converted organic greenhouse and a similar, neighboring greenhouse under conventional management. The dynamics of copiotrophic and oligotrophic bacteria after a disturbance were monitored, and the resistance and resilience were calculated. The organic soil showed significantly higher water-holding capacity, organic matter content, total C and N contents, C:N ratio of the small particulate organic matter fraction, microbial biomass carbon, oxygen uptake rate, copiotrophic and oligotrophic bacterial communities and suppression of flax wilt incidence. After incorporation of a grass-clover mixture in both soils, the densities of copiotrophic and oligotrophic bacteria oscillated over time. The relative amplitudes of the oscillations (in grass-clover amended over non-amended soil) and the frequencies of the oscillations of both trophic groups were lower for the organic soil, indicating that the resistance and resilience of the microbial community were greater in this soil. These results support the hypothesis that the bacterial response to a disturbance can serve as an integral indicator for soil health, including disease suppressiveness. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Conventional; Disease suppression; Microbial activity; Organic; Resilience; Soil health","Amir, H., Alabouvette, C., Involvement of soil abiotic factors in the mechanisms of soil suppressiveness to Fusarium wilts (1993) Soil.

Two successive rice fields (1st field and 2nd field) were divided into fertilized and non-fertilized parts and CH4 measurements were conducted at the inlet, middle and outlet positions of each field. The results showed that CH4 emissions at non-fertilized parts were higher than those at fertilized part in both rice fields. The average CH4 emissions ranged from 8.7 to 26.6 mg m-2 h-1 in all positions in both rice fields. The spatial variation in CH4 emission among the positions was high in both rice fields with the highest emissions in the outlet of the 1st field and the inlet of the 2nd field. The CH4 emissions at these two positions showed 2 - 2.5 times higher than those at other positions in both rice fields. Stepwise regression analysis indicates that soil total carbon content is the primary factor for CH4 emission. The average CH4 emissions during rice growing season were 13.5 mg m-2 h-1 for the 1st field and 15.7 mg m-2 h-1 for the 2nd field. Spearman rank order correlation analysis showed that CH4 emission was significantly and positively correlated with soil temperature, surface water depth and negatively correlated with soil redox potential. The result indicated that high within field spatial variation in CH4 emissions required different site specific management practices to mitigate CH4 emissions in lowland paddy rice soil. © 2015, Oo et al.; licensee Springer.","Fertilizer; Lowland rice; Methane emission; Soil properties; Spatial variation","Adhya, T.K., Mishra, S.R., Rath, A.K., Bharati, K., Mohanty, S.R., Ramakrishnan, B., Rao, V.R., Sethunathan, N., Methane efflux from rice-based cropping systems under humid tropical conditions of eastern India (2000) Agric Ecosys Environ, 79, pp. 85-90; Adhya, T.K., Pattanaik, P., Satpathy, S.N., Kumarswamy, S., Sethunathan, N., Influence of phosphorus application on methane emission and production in flooded paddy soils (1998) Soil Biol Biochem, 30 (2), pp. 177-181; Babu, Y.J., Nayak, D.R., Adhya, T.K., Potassium application reduces methane emission from flooded field planted to rice (2006) Biol Fert Soil, 42 (6), pp. 532-541; Banik, A., Sen, M., Sen, S.P., Effects of inorganic fertilizers and micronutrients on CH4 production from wetland rice (Oryza sativa L) (1996) Biol Fert Soils, 21, pp. 322-391; Bodelier, P.L.E., Hahn, A.P., Arth, I.R., Frenzel, P., Effects of ammonium-based fertilization on microbial processes involved in methane emissions from soils planted with rice (2000) Biogeochem, 51, pp. 225-257; Bodelier, P.L.E., Roslev, P., Henckel, T., Frenzel, P., Stimulation by ammonium-based fertilizers of methane oxidation in soil around rice roots (2000) Nature, 403, pp. 421-424; Cai, Z., Xing, G., Yan, X., Xu, H., Tsuruta, H., Yagi, K., Minami, K., Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from rice paddy fields as affected by nitrogen fertilizers and water management (1997) Plant Soil, 196, pp. 7-14; Carroll, J.J., What is Henry’s Law?

Vein orebodies are localized in NW-trending extensional faults. Hydrothermal alteration is well developed and includes silicification, potassic alteration, chloritization and sericitization. Three stages of mineralization are recognized based on field evidence and petrographic observation and are marked by assemblages of quartz-arsenopyrite-pyrite (stage I), quartz-pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite-sphalerite (stage II) and quartz-galena-silver minerals (stage III). The granite, with a zircon age of 143.2±1.5Ma (n=14, MSWD=0.93), is subalkaline, peraluminous and is classified as A2-type granite originating in a post-orogenic extensional setting during the opening of suture zone between the North China Craton and the Siberia Craton from the Late Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous. The δ34S<inf>CDT</inf> values of sulfides, ranging from 3.19 to 10.65‰, are not consistent with the majority of magmatic hydrothermal deposits in the SGXR, possibly implying accessory source in addition to magmatic source. Microthermometric measurements show that ore minerals were deposited at intermediate temperatures (347.8-136.4°C) with moderate salinities (2.9-14.4wt.% NaCl). Ore-forming fluids were derived largely from magmatic hydrothermal processes, with the addition of meteoric water in late stage. Successive precipitation of Pb, Zn and Ag occurred with changes of physicochemical conditions. Overall considering mineralization features, ore-forming fluids and materials and tectonic setting and comparing with adjacent deposits, the Bianjiadayuan deposit is a mesothermal magmatic hydrothermal vein-type Pb-Zn-Ag deposit controlled by fractures and related to A2-type granite in response to the tectonic/magmatic/hydrothermal activity in late Jurassic. Besides, the explosive breccias in the west area require more attention in future exploration. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","A2-type granite; Bianjiadayuan deposit; Fluid inclusions; S isotope; Southern Great Xing'an Range; Zircon U-Pb dating","Bai, L.A., Sun, J.G., Sun, Q.L., Gu, A.L., Zhao, K.Q., Men, L.J., Ore-forming fluids and genesis of Lianhuashan Cu deposit in middle Da Hinggan Mountains (2012) Miner.

However, despite their potential, an obvious disadvantage of NADES is the high viscosity. Here we explored the dilution effect on the structures and physicochemical properties of NADES and their improvements of applications using quercetin and carthamin. The results of FT-IR and 1H NMR experiments demonstrated that there are intensive H-bonding interactions between the two components of NADES and dilution with water caused the interactions weaken gradually and even disappeared completely at around 50% (v/v) water addition. A small amount of water could reduce the viscosity of NADES to the range of water and increase the conductivity by up to 100 times for some NADES. This study provides the basis for modulating NADES in a controllable way for their applications in food processing, enzyme reactions, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The infusions were analyzed with HS-SPME coupled with GC-MS; 29 volatile compounds were detected, of which nine were found to be scent components. The cultivars were clustered into three clusters characterized according to scent components. The 'Conqueror' and 'Virginia' cultivars had the highest antioxidant activities. The concentrations of polyphenols and flavonoids showed significant positive correlations with antioxidant activity as measured by DPPH, ABTS+, and FRAP assays.

Lipid oxidation increased (p < 0.05) during storage in emulsion gels containing transglutaminase or alginate. Analyses of the half-bandwidth of the 2923 cm-1 band and the area of the 3220 cm-1 band suggest that the order/disorder of the oil lipid chain related to lipid interactions and droplet size in the emulsion gels could be decisive in determining their textural properties.

The new method was based on the dispersion of the sorbent into the sample to maximize the contact surface. In this approach, the dispersion of the sorbent at a very low milligram level was achieved by injecting a mixture solution of the sorbent and disperser solvent into the aqueous sample. Thereby, a cloudy solution formed. The cloudy solution resulted from the dispersion of the fine particles of the sorbent in the bulk aqueous sample. After extraction, the cloudy solution was centrifuged and the enriched analytes in the sediment phase dissolved in ethanol and determined by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Under the optimized conditions, the detection limit for lead and cadmium ions was 1.2 μg L-1 and 0.2 μg L-1, respectively. Furthermore, the preconcentration factor was 299.3 and 137.1 for cadmium and lead ions, respectively. SA-DSPE was successfully applied for trace determination of lead and cadmium in fruit (Citrus limetta, Kiwi and pomegranate) and water samples. Finally, the introduced sample preparation method can be used as a simple, rapid, reliable, selective and sensitive method for flame atomic absorption spectrophotometric determination of trace levels of lead and cadmium ions in fruit and water samples. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The -7 °C sample fillings stored for 180 d had a significantly lower breaking strength and water-holding capacity than those stored at -18 °C and -7 °C/-18 °C (P < 0.05). Microscopy of stained samples showed significant fat exudation in the high (-7 °C) and fluctuating (-7 °C/-18 °C) temperature treatments during storage, coinciding with decreased thermal stability of OMP. There was a more abundant carbonyl production in OMP than in IMP (P < 0.05). The storage modulus G′ in OMP was significantly lower than that in IMP. Moreover, SDS-PAGE showed that -7 °C and -7 °C/-18 °C samples produced more insoluble protein aggregates. These findings indicate that oxidative damage and reduced gelling potential of OMP proteins led to reduced textural properties in frozen dumplings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we characterized the antioxidant capacity (TAC) and the phenolic profile in white, red and black rice varieties, and evaluated the effect of two cooking methods (i.e. ""risotto"" and boiling) on these compounds. Before the cooking, all the varieties contained several phenolic acids, whereas anthocyanins and flavonols were peculiar of black rice and flavan-3-ols of red rice. Among the rice varieties, the black had the highest TAC value. The content of (poly)phenolic compounds and TAC decreased after cooking in all three varieties, but to a lesser extent after the risotto method. As a consequence, the risotto cooking, which allows a complete absorption of water, would be a good cooking method to retain (poly)phenolic compounds and TAC in pigmented and non-pigmented whole-meal rice. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.","(Poly)phenolic compounds; Domestic cooking; Pigmented rice; Total antioxidant capacity","Abdel Aal, E.S.M., Hucl, P., Composition and stability of anthocyanins in blue-grained wheat (2003) Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 51, pp. 2174-2180; Abdel Aal, E.S.M., Young, J.C., Rabalski, I., Anthocyanin composition in black, blue, pink, purple, and red cereal grains (2006) Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 54, pp. 4696-4704; Awika, J.M., Dykes, L., Gu, L., Rooney, L.W., Prior, R.L., Processing of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and sorghum products alters procyanidin oligomer and polymer distribution and content (2003) Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 51, pp. 5516-5521; Barros, F., Awika, J.M., Rooney, L.W., Interaction of tannins and other sorghum phenolic compounds with starch and effects on in vitro starch digestibility (2012) Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 60, pp. 11609-11617; Benzie, I.F.F., Strain, J.J., Ferric reducing/antioxidant power assay direct measure of total antioxidant activity of biological fluids and modified version for simultaneous measurement of total antioxidant power and ascorbic acid concentration (1999) Methods Enzymology, 299, pp. 15-27; Bordiga, M., Gomez-Alonso, S., Locatelli, M., Travaglia, F., Coïsson, J.D., Hermosin-Gutierrez, I., Phenolics characterization and antioxidant activity of six different pigmented Oryza sativa L.

Doughs were observed immediately after mixing, 90 and 360 min of leavening at 30 °C. Fundamental rheology, yeasts heat production by isothermal microcalorimetry and the interaction between water and biopolymers by means of time domain nuclear magnetic resonance were evaluated. In addition aromatic metabolite development was followed by means of the combined application of gas-chromatography and electronic nose. KAMUT® Khorasan flour was found to be more suitable than durum wheat for the fermentation processes tested, especially at acidic conditions, as shown by the increase of the volume and the metabolic heat production by yeast. In acidified dough the pattern of volatile metabolites allowed a clear distinction between the types of dough. Moreover the water/starch proton pool was characterized by higher T<inf>2</inf> values in the KAMUT® Khorasan samples. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to locate the antioxidant ingredients of the aqueous AGE, an activity-guided fractionation approach using ABTS assay, DPPH assay and FRAP assay were conducted to guide the fractionation by means of extraction, column chromatography and semi-preparative HPLC. Some phenols and organosulfur compounds were identified as antioxidants in AGE by GC-MS. Furthermore, UV, IR, ESI-MS, NMR and specific rotation experiments led to the identification of l-phenylalanine, l-tryptophan, (3S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline-3-carboxylic acid, (1S,3S)-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline-3-carboxylic acid, and (1R,3S)-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline-3-carboxylic acid as the major antioxidants in the AGE.

The betalains used as active agent were extracted from purple fruits of Opuntia ficus-indica (BE) and encapsulated with maltodextrin and cladode mucilage MD-CM and only with MD. The microcapsulates were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal analysis (TGA-DSC), tristimulus colorimetry, as well as, their humidity, water activity and dietary fiber content were also determined. The active agent content was measured by UV-Vis spectrophotometry and its composition confirmed by HPLC-ESIMS. A pigment storage stability test was performed at 18 C and different relative humidities. The addition of CM in the formulation increased the encapsulation efficiency, diminished the moisture content, and allowed to obtain more uniform size and spherical particles, with high dietary fiber content.

Among other mineral nutrients, K, Ca and Zn concentrations decreased, while P, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn and B concentrations did not change.

From coarse bran over coarse and fine weatings to low grade flour, the content of starch and lipids increased, while that of DF and ash decreased. Enzyme activity levels differed strongly and were not related to other by-product properties. Average particle size of the by-products was positively correlated with DF and ash contents and their hydration properties. When meals from flour and by-products were composed on the same overall starch level to compensate for differences in endosperm contamination in the by-products, bread specific volume was more strongly depressed with fine weatings and low grade flour than with coarse bran and weatings. This suggests that the properties of the former were intrinsically more detrimental to bread making than those of the latter. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Water was pumped from the test wells at a constant rate while the drawdown in the observation wells was determined as a function of time. The data obtained were subjected to graphical and analytical evaluation using the Cooper-Jacob method. The result revealed that the mean values of the transmissivity, storage coefficient and specific capacity of the aquifer layer are 6.15·10-2 m2/min, 9.3·10-4 and 0.33 m2/min respectively. Analysis of the results indicated that the aquifer will be very productive and able to supply sufficient quantity of water for the people. The result also revealed that the aquifer is confined and therefore dependable to provide good quality water for the people living in the area. © 2014 Anomohanran and Iserhien-Emekeme.","Aquifer parameters; Groundwater; Pumping test; Specific capacity; Storage coefficient; Transmissivity","Akaolisa, C., Aquifer transmissivity and basement structure determination using resistivity sounding at Jos plateau state Nigeria (2006) Environ.

Large number of textile industries are located on the coastal areas due to ease of transport to the various places in world and help in building nations economy, but on the contrary the effluents released from these industries are proving a great problem for the marine life. Therefore, industrial effluents containing dyes must be treated before their safe discharge into the environment. There are various physiochemical methods are conventionally used. These methods are effective but quite expensive leading to the production of solid sludge. Bacterial spp. capable of thriving under high salt conditions could be employed for the treatment of saline dye-contaminated textile wastewaters. Most of the Scientists used chemical coagulation, Flocculation and Precipitation techniques for the removal of dye colors from waste waters. But this method is not cost beneficial as it generates huge amount of Sludge and to dispose the sludge is major problem. The physical methods are also not cost effective. So only biological treatment using acclimatized microorganisms could remove 99-100% dye colour from wastewater. Hence now a day most of the workers concentrated on biotransformation of textile azo dyes by adapted organisms. The use of co substrates also slightly increased the decolorization of dye solution. Some scientists showed that the products of dye degradation are not toxic to biological system. Products formed can be determined by Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) technique, Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) etc. © 2014 Shertate and Thorat.","Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD); Ecological and Toxicological Association Of Dyes (ETAD); Organic Pigment Manufactures (OPM)","Acuner, E., Dilek, F.B., Treatment of tectilon yellow 2 G by chlorella vulgaris (2004) Process Biochem, 39, pp. 623-631; Ajayi, S.O., Osibanjo, O., The state of environment in Nig.

Modification with various crosslinkers, namely glyoxal, polyisocyanate, a glyoxal-polyisocyanate combination, waterborne epoxy latex and modified polyamide, were employed to further enhance the water resistance of the thermal-acid treated soybean protein (TSP). FTIR and DSC analyses confirmed that all of the crosslinkers could chemically react with the TSP, but the crosslinking degree varied with crosslinker species. The positive effect of crosslinker species on the water resistance and thermal stability of the TSP as evaluated by a boiling water-insoluble test and TGA analysis was in the order modified polyamide. > glyoxal-polyisocyanate. > polyisocyanate. > epoxy latex. > glyoxal. In addition, wood flour-reinforced soybean protein-based composites were successfully fabricated to investigate the possibility of manufacturing acceptable biocomposites using crosslinked and thermal-acid treated soybean protein. FTIR analysis, SEM observation and tensile property evaluation showed that all crosslinkers except glyoxal could react with wood flour to form various chemical bonds at the protein-wood interface and therefore significantly improve the water resistance and tensile strength of the obtained composites. The extent of improvement depended on the crosslinker species and crosslinking mechanism. Modified polyamide was the most preferable crosslinker for commercial applications because its modified composite had good tensile strength and the best water resistance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Crosslinking; Mechanical properties; Soybean protein; Thermal-acid treatment; Water resistance","Arboleda, J.C., Rojas, O.J., Lucia, L.A., Acid-generated soy protein hydrolysates and their interfacial behavior on model surfaces (2014) Biomacromolecules, 15, pp. 4336-4342; Budrugeac, P., Segal, E., Applicability of the kissinger equation in thermal analysis (2007) J.

Yeast extract (YE) and dried spent yeast (DSY) were used as nitrogen supplements. Under high gravity (HG, ~200gl-1 of total sugar) conditions, the addition of either 6gl-1 of YE or 9gl-1 of DSY did not increase the ethanol concentration (P), but it promoted the rate of ethanol production or ethanol productivity (Q<inf>p</inf>). The Q<inf>p</inf> value of the control treatment (no supplement) was 1.96gl-1h-1. The P (93.4-94.0gl-1) and Q<inf>p</inf> (3.89-3.92gl-1h-1) values under the YE and DSY supplementation were comparable, indicating that DSY could be used to replace YE in ethanol production. Under very high gravity (VHG, ~280gl-1 of total sugar) conditions, the supplementation of nitrogen and trace elements (Zn2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+) coupled with the aeration supply were required to improve the ethanol production efficiency. Under the supplementation (in gl-1) of DSY (13.5), Zn2+ (0.01), Mg2+ (0.05) and Mn2+ (0.04) in the presence of aeration supply at 0.05vvm for 12h, the P and Q<inf>p</inf> values were 126.3gl-1 and 2.11gl-1h-1, respectively. The P and Q<inf>p</inf> values under the same supplementation without aeration were 114.8gl-1 and 1.91gl-1h-1, respectively, and these values under no supplementation and no aeration were 108.0gl-1 and 1.50gl-1h-1, respectively. In addition, glycerol (the main by-product during ethanol fermentation) under aeration conditions was ~3gl-1 lower than that without aeration. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aeration; High gravity (HG) fermentation; Low-cost nitrogen; Sweet sorghum; Trace elements; Very high gravity (VHG) fermentation","Alcoba-Florez, J., Mendez-Alvarez, S., Cano, J., Guarro, J., Perez-Roth, E., del Pilar Arevalo, M., Phenotypic and molecular characterization of Candida nivariensis sp. nov., a possible new opportunistic fungus (2005) J.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of gamma irradiation in the phenolic compounds of Ginkgo biloba L. (infusion and methanol/water extract), widely used in traditional medicine and in dietary supplements. Twenty-five compounds were detected, eighteen of which were flavonoids, one phenolic acid, five terpene lactones and one unknown compound. Among the quantified phenolic compounds, flavonoids were the main group present, being two kaempferol derivatives the major compounds found: kaempferol-3- O-dirhamnosylglucoside and kaempferol-3- O-rutinoside. The irradiation with the highest dose (10. kGy) is sufficient to guarantee the product disinfestation and microbial decontamination, also contributing to an increase in the extractability of phenolic compounds, both in methanol/water and infusion preparations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Gamma irradiation; Ginkgo biloba; Phenolic compounds","Acosta-Estrada, B.A., Gutierrez-Uribe, J.A., Serna-Saldivar, S.O., Bound phenolics in foods, a review (2014) Food Chem., 152, pp. 46-55; Alothman, M., Bhat, R., Karim, A.A., Effects of radiation processing on phytochemicals and antioxidants in plant produce (2009) Trends Food Sci.

The proposed system utilises low grade thermal energy to heat thermoelectric generators for power generation and water desalination. A theoretical analysis presents the governing equations to estimate the systems performance characteristics combined with experimental validation. Experimental set-up consists of an electric heat source, thermoelectric modules, heat pipes, a heat sink and an evaporator vessel. Four heat pipes are embedded in a heat spreader block to passively cool the bottom side of the thermoelectric cells. The condenser of these four heat pipes is immersed in a pool of saline water stored in an evaporation vessel which is maintained at sub-atmospheric pressure. The liquid to vapour phase change cooling method achieve low saturation temperature and offers a high heat transfer coefficient for the cooling of the thermoelectric generators.

Therefore, this experimental study was carried out to investigate the flow characteristics such as pressure gradients, flow patterns and holdups/velocity ratios of medium viscosity oil/water flow with low IFT in horizontal pipe of 30.6mm-ID. The medium viscosity oil is a mineral oil with viscosity and density of about 24cP and 872kgm-3 respectively at 25°C. Measurement of the flow characteristics covered the range of mixture velocities from 0.1 to 1.5m/s and input oil volume fractions from 0.1 to 0.9. Pressure gradients were found to increase with increase in mixture velocities and input oil fractions. Phase inversions were observed at mixture velocity as low as 0.6m/s where there were sharp increase in the pressure gradients and the phase inversion points occurred between 0.55 and 0.6 input oil fractions for the whole range of flow conditions. In addition, all the flow patterns identified using visual observation and high speed video camera can be grouped into three categories - stratified, dual continuous and dispersed flow. In terms of mixture velocity, the stratified flow was observed up to 0.2m/s, the dual continuous flow was between 0.2 and 0.5m/s and the dispersed flow was observed from 0.6m/s and above. The velocity ratios were found to increase with increase in mixture velocity except at high input oil fractions where oil was the continuous phase. It was also observed that water was the faster flowing phase at low and medium mixture velocities while the reverse was the case at high mixture velocity. Lastly, the results of the study were compared with existing results from previous works which used medium-viscosity but high-forming IFT oils. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Flow patterns; Holdups; Low interfacial tension; Medium-viscosity oil; Oil-water; Pressure gradients","Al-Wahaibi, T., Pressure gradient correlation for oil-water separated flow in horizontal pipes (2012) Exp.

The study was performed using an undivided stirred tank reactor equipped with a DSA (Ti/IrO<inf>2</inf>) anode and a zirconium spiral cathode. A statistical design of experiments was used to study the influence of different operating variables: substance concentration (6.0-1624.0μmolL-1), current density (3.25-30.25mAcm-2) and NaCl concentration (0.05-0.4molL-1). According to the Pareto chart, current density was the main variable influencing OXA degradation, followed by NaCl concentration. The effect of the initial pH and type of supporting electrolyte was also evaluated. The latter lead to the identification of different degradation routes which depended on the electrolyte employed. By using the best electrolyte and current density, complete OXA removal and total loss of antimicrobial activity was achieved after only 4min of treatment. The efficiency in the oxacillin degradation was not significantly affected by the initial pH (3-9). Interestingly, no mineralization was observed even after long exposure times (8h). However, 70% of the initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) was eliminated and the level of biodegradability (BOD<inf>5</inf>/COD) increased from 0.03 to 0.84, indicating that the system is able to transform the pollutant into highly oxidized and biodegradable bio-products with no antimicrobial activity. Additionally, different substances and radical scavengers present in wastewaters and natural water did not significantly affect the efficiency of the process. Finally, the more relevant initial aromatic by-products were identified and a degradation schema of the electrochemical oxidation of the OXA antibiotic was proposed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Anodic oxidation; Antibiotics; Antimicrobial activity; DSA anodes; Electro-oxidation; Water treatment","Faouzi, M., Cañizares, P., Gadri, A., Lobato, J., Nasr, B., Paz, R., Rodrigo, M.A., Saez, C., Advanced oxidation processes for the treatment of wastes polluted with azoic dyes (2006) Electrochim.

Undulated pipeline consists of two inclined sections (uphill and downhill) connected between two horizontal pipes (upstream and downstream) at peak configuration. Experiments have been conducted over a wide range of superficial velocities of oil (U<inf>SO</inf>=0.015-1.3m/s) and water (U<inf>SW</inf>=0.1-1.2m/s). Seven different flow patterns (viz., plug, slug, wavy stratified, stratified mixed, wispy annular, dispersion of oil in water and dispersion of water in oil) are identified by visual, imaging and electrical conductance probe techniques at all the four sections. Our results shows that present undulation (5°) has a marginal effect on the flow behavior of viscous oil-water mixture and the range of fluid velocity differs for a particular flow pattern. The pressure gradient characteristics across the peak experiences relatively more pressure gradient as compared to upstream and downstream at U<inf>SW</inf>≥0.6m/s, which is attributed to the combined effect of undulation (viz., peak configuration) along the pipeline, flow pattern, and effective viscosity and density of the fluid mixture. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Electrical conductance probe; Flow pattern transitions; Undulated pipeline; Viscous oil-water flow; Wispy annular flow","Clark, A.F., Shapiro, A., (1949), p. 878Russell, T.W.F., Hodgson, G.W., Govier, G.W., Horizontal pipeline flow of mixtures of oil and water (1959) Can.

The experiments were conducted in a vertical circular tube that was heated uniformly with a large AC power supply. A twisted tape with a twist ratio of 2 or 4 was inserted into the circular tube to induce the swirl flow. The test parameters were as follows: heat flux q=5-19.5MW/m2; system pressure P=3, 4.2, 5MPa; mass flux G=6000, 8000, 10,000kg/(m2s); and inlet bulk temperature T<inf>b</inf><inf>,</inf><inf>i</inf>=50-200°C. The heat transfer coefficients and boiling curves are obtained from single-phase forced convection to fully developed nucleate boiling. The influences of mass flux, heat flux, system pressure, thermodynamic quality, and inlet subcooling on heat transfer are discussed in detail. Special attention is paid to the effect of the twisted tape on subcooled heat transfer. More importantly, a wide set of heat transfer correlations are evaluated on the basis of our experimental data, and relevant recommendations for engineering applications are made according to their prediction accuracies. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.","Heat transfer; High heat flux; ITER; Subcooled flow boiling; Twisted tape","Dobran, F., Fusion energy conversion in magnetically confined plasma reactors (2012) Prog.

Based on these data, power-law correlations are presented for the dimensionless Sauter mean diameter, bubble size distribution, bubble ellipticity, and volumetric mass transfer coefficient in terms of relevant parameters including the axial and azimuthal Reynolds numbers. The interaction between wall-driven Taylor vortices and the axial passage of buoyancy-driven gas bubbles leads to significantly different dependencies of the mass transfer coefficient on important operating parameters such as inner cylinder angular velocity and axial superficial gas velocity than has been observed in horizontally oriented gas-liquid Taylor vortex reactors. In general, the volumetric mass transfer coefficients in vertical Taylor vortex reactors have a weaker dependence upon both the axial and azimuthal Reynolds numbers and are smaller in magnitude than those observed in horizontal Taylor vortex reactors or in stirred tank reactors. These findings can be explained by differences in the size and spatial distribution of gas bubbles in the vertically oriented reactor in comparison with the other systems. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Bubble size distribution; Gas-liquid mass transfer; Multiphase flow; Sherwood number; Taylor-Couette vortex bioreactor","Schlüter, V., Deckwer, W., Gas/liquid mass transfer in stirred vessels (1992) Chem.

Quantification of the accuracy of overheating prediction is of interest in the best-estimate safety analyses, even though the peak cladding temperatures due to the water seal formation in the loop seal seldom approach acceptance criteria as such. The aim of this study was to test and evaluate the accuracy with which the thermal-hydraulic system code nodalizations of the PWR PACTEL predict loop seal clearing in a small break loss-of-coolant-accident test performed with the PWR PACTEL facility. PWR PACTEL is a thermal-hydraulic test facility with two loops and vertical inverted U-tube steam generators. Post-test simulations were performed with the TRACE and APROS system codes. In the post-test simulations, the main events of the transient such as the decrease in the core water level, depressurization of the primary circuit, and the behavior of the water seal formation and clearing in the loop seal were predicted satisfactorily by both codes. However, discrepancies with the experiment results were observed in the analyses with both codes, for example the core temperature excursions were halted too early and the peak temperature predictions were too low. The core water level increase caused by loop seal clearing was overestimated with both codes, and the pressure and temperature were overestimated on the secondary side of the steam generators. Loop Seal 2 was evidently cleared out while Loop Seal 1 remained closed, just like in the experiment. It was noticed that, which of the loop seals clears in the simulations, was sensitive on the nodalization structure and initial conditions. The simulations indicate that the PWR PACTEL nodalizations are capable of simulating loop seal clearing quantitatively well. A quantitative error in the non-conservative direction was observed in peak cladding temperatures in both codes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The loss of these resources is a serious problem in the Taihang Mountains, and the emerging issue with water has threatened the livelihoods of local residents and the sustainability of this region. A simple distributed soil erosion and sediment yield model (DSESYM) has been developed based on WetSpa extension. The effect of land-use change on surface runoff and sediment yield was then analyzed through applying the model in the Chongling watershed. Taking the land-use distribution of the watershed in 2000 as the baseline, fourteen scenarios were performed to characterize the effect of land-use change on surface runoff and sediment load relative to the baseline condition. These scenarios involved converting the mixed land-use to 93.89% of the area being forestland (scenario 1), shrubland (scenario 2), grassland (scenario 3), cropland (scenario 4), mixed crop/forest land (scenarios 5 and 6), mixed crop/shrub land (scenarios 7 and 8), mixed crop/grass land (scenarios 9 and 10), mixed crop/shrub/forest land (scenarios 11 and 12), and mixed crop/grass/forest land (scenarios 13 and 14). The scenario analysis revealed that when land-use was changed to 93.89% of the respective land-use in scenarios 4, 5, 7 and 9, an increase in runoff and sediment yield for single rain events compared to the baseline whereas a change to forest and shrubland caused a decrease (scenarios 1 and 2). Slope is an important factor in soil erosion, but in the study area, when the slope is more than 10°, the difference of stream flow and sediment between forest, shrub and grass was not obvious (scenarios 5, 7 and 9). The model can be used to predict surface runoff, erosion, deposition and sediment yield of each grid cell and the whole watershed in response to land-use scenarios for single rain events in the Taihang Mountains. It is easy to execute if the precipitation process data, the relationships of water and sediment for different land-use, and GIS maps of the study area are available, which makes it suitable for widespread application. © 2015.","Land-use scenarios; Sediment yield; Slope; Soil erosion and sediment yield model; Surface runoff; Taihang Mountains","Alkharabsheh, M.M., Alexandridis, T.K., Bilas, G., Misopolinos, N., Silleos, N., Impact of land cover change on soil erosion hazard in northern Jordan using remote sensing and GIS (2013) Procedia Environ.

Nine urban trees species (hardwood and softwood) from Spain were studied. The experiments were carried out in a semi-continuous reactor at 250. °C for 64. min. The hemicellulose and cellulose recovery yields were between 30%. wt. and 80%. wt. while the lignin content in the solid product ranged between 32%. wt. and 92%. wt. It was observed that an increment of solubilized lignin disfavored the hydrolysis of hemicelluloses. It was determined that the maximum extraction of hemicellulose was achieved at 20. min of solid reaction time while the extraction of celluloses not exhibited a maximum value. The hydrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose would be governed by the hydrolysis kinetic and the polymers accessibility. In addition, the extraction of hemicellulose was negatively affected by the lignin content in the raw material while cellulose hydrolysis was not affected by this parameter. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Biorefinery; Glucose; Process flexibility; Xylose","Arai, K., Smith, R.L., Aida, T.M., Decentralized chemical processes with supercritical fluid technology for sustainable society (2009) J.

Initially, the effect of different geometry parameters that correspond to different design cases have been investigated on the hydrostatic stability of the semisubmersible support platform through the comparison of righting arm and righting moments. Afterwards, the dynamic behavior and performance of the V-shaped semisubmersible wind turbine are presented for one of the examined design cases. Aero-hydro-servo-elastic numerical modeling has been applied for achieving coupled integrated time-domain analysis in order to investigate the dynamics of the V-shaped semisubmersible offshore wind turbine. The water depth is selected to be 100m in order to study the feasibility of such concept in moderate water depth. The wave-induced as well as wave-wind-induced motions, tension of mooring lines and functionality of wind turbine are presented and discussed for selected environmental conditions. In general, the results show that the presented in the present paper V-shaped semisubmersible offshore wind turbine is a promising concept which can enhance the offshore wind industry. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Floating wind turbine; Offshore wind technology; Stochastic dynamics; V-shaped semisubmersible platform; Wave-wind-induced","Breton, S.F., Moe, G., Status, plans and technologies for offshore wind turbines in Europe and North America (2009) Renew Energy, 34 (3), pp. 646-654; Shi, W., Park, H., Han, J., Na, S., Kim, C., Astudy on the effect of different modeling parameters on the dynamic response of a jacket-type offshore wind turbine in the Korean Southwest Sea (2013) Renew Energy, 58, pp. 50-59; Shi, W., Han, J., Kim, C., Lee, D., Shin, H., Park, H., Feasibility study of offshore wind turbine substructures for southwest offshore wind farm project in Korea (2015) Renew Energy, 74, pp. 406-413; Musial, W., Butterfield, S., Ram, B., (2006) Energy from offshore wind, pp. 1888-1898. , Offshore Technology Conference Houston, Texas, USA; Myhr, A., Bjerkseter, C., Ågotnes, A., Nygaard, T.A., Levelised cost of energy for offshore floating wind turbines in a life cycle perspective (2014) Renew Energy, 66, pp. 714-728; Sun, X., Huang, D., Wu, G., The current state of offshore wind energy technology development (2012) Energy, 41, pp. 298-312; Karimirad, M., (2014) Offshore energy structures, , Springer, Switzerland; Karimirad, M., (2011) Stochastic dynamic response analysis of spar-type wind turbines with catenary or taut mooring systems, , [Thesis in partial fulfillment of the Doctor of Philoshophy degree, submitted to and defended in the Department of Marine Technology], Norwegian University of Science and Technology; Butterfield, S., Musial, W., Jonkman, J., Sclavounos, P., (2005) Engineering challenges for floating offshore wind turbines, , Copenhagen Offshore Wind Conference, Copenhagen, Denmark; Hall, M., Buckham, B., Crawford, C., Hydrodynamics-based floating wind turbine support platform optimization: a basis function approach (2014) Renew Energy, 66, pp. 559-569; Bagbanci, H., Karmakar, D., Guedes Soares, C., (2012) Review of offshore floating wind turbine concepts, maritime engineering and technology, pp. 553-562. , Taylor & Francis Group, London, C.

Authigenic carbonates at marine hydrocarbon seeps provide excellent geological and geochemical archives that serve to explore seepage dynamics over time. In this study, we investigated the potential of Mössbuaer spectroscopy and Fe contents of seep-related authigenic carbonates from the Congo Fan, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Black Sea for reconstructing past redox conditions and fluid seepage activity at cold seeps. The Fe speciation observed by Mössbauer spectroscopy and Fe contents suggest that (1) the Congo Fan carbonates precipitated in a sulfidic environment, (2) the formation conditions of seep carbonates were variable at the Gulf of Mexico seep site, ranging from oxic to suboxic and anoxic and even spanning into the methanogenic zone, and (3) the stratified water column of the Black Sea or suboxic condition resulted in low Fe contents of Black Sea carbonates. The study reveals that Fe speciation can provide constraints on the wide range of redox conditions that imprinted seep carbonates during the life span of seepage. Similarly, Mössbauer spectroscopy - particularly when used in combination with the analysis of redox-sensitive elements - is a promising tool to trace variable redox conditions in marine paleoenvironments other than seeps. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Authigenic carbonate; Hydrocarbon seep; Iron; Mössbauer spectroscopy; Redox condition","Algeo, T., Tribovillard, N., Environmental analysis of paleoceanographic systems based on molybdenum-uranium covariation (2009) Chem.

First an oil-in-water emulsion was formed and afterwards the emulsion was dried by spray-drying or by particles from gas saturated solutions-drying (PGSS-drying). β-Glucans were precipitated also by supercritical anti-solvent (SAS), but it was not a suitable drying process for this material. Particles were characterized regarding particle size, morphology, crystallinity, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro activity against B. cinerea. Although the emulsions with β-glucans had bigger droplet size than the ones with lecithin, there was no difference on particle size for each encapsulating material, it was just dependent on the drying process. For all the materials and drying processes, completely amorphous particles were obtained, in spite of the crystalline form of the pure active compounds. Concerning the antifungal activity, the encapsulation of tebuconazole did not improve its action, because it was already very effective. Pristine resveratrol did not reduce fungal growth, but it was inhibited between 50% and 70% with encapsulated resveratrol, which implies the production of an effective fungicide against B. cinerea totally from natural origin substances. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.","Fungicide; Lecithin; PGSS-drying; Resveratrol; Spray-drying; β-Glucan","Adrian, M., Jeandet, P., Effects of resveratrol on the ultrastructure of Botrytis cinerea conidia and biological significance in plant/pathogen interactions (2012) Fitoterapia, 83 (8), pp. 1345-1350; Adrian, M., Jeandet, P., Veneau, J., Weston, L., Bessis, R., Biological activity of resveratrol, a stilbenic compound from grapevines, against Botrytis cinerea, the causal agent for gray mold (1997) J.

A copper fin was employed in the U-tube to assume a constant heat flux. The thermal performance of the EEUSC was evaluated under a wide range of operating conditions. Moreover, to increase the heat transfer efficiency in the U-tube over the thermal resistance of the air gap, a novel method was developed, which entailed filling the gap with high-thermal-conductivity liquid. Multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanofluid was used as the working fluid. Evaluation results showed that the efficiency of the EEUSC is influenced primarily by the air gap and that it increases by 4% with the use of the MWCNT nanoliquid. Calculations based on this improvement revealed that the annual CO<inf>2</inf> and SO<inf>2</inf> emissions will reduce by 1600kg and 5.3kg, respectively, when 50 solar collectors are employed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Apparent conductance; Heat transfer; Nanofluid; Solar collector; U-tube","Liu, L., Wang, Z., Zhang, H., Xue, Y., Solar energy development in China - a review (2010) Renew Sust Energy Rev, 14, pp. 301-311; Badran, A.A., Yousef, I.A., Joudeh, N.K., Hamad, R.A., Halawa, H., Hassouneh, H.K., Portable solar cooker and water heater (2010) Energy Convers Manag, pp. 1605-1609; Frier, D., Cable, R.G., An overview and operation optimization of the Kramer junction solar electric generating system (1999) ISES World Congr, pp. 241-246; Georgiev, A., Simulation and experimental results of a vacuum solar collector system with storage (2005) Energy Convers Manag, 46, pp. 1423-1442; Georgiev, A., Kreider, J., (1979) Medium and high temperature solar processes, , Academic Press, New York; Thirugnanasambandam, M., Iniyan, S., Goic, R., Areview of solar thermal technologies (2010) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 14, pp. 312-322; Kalogirou, S.A., Solar thermal collectors and applications (2004) Prog Energy Combust Sci, 30, pp. 231-295; Mahian, O., Kianifar, A., Kalogirou, S.A., Pop, I., Wongwises, S., Areview of the applications of nanofluids in solar energy (2013) Int J Heat Mass Transfer, 57, pp. 582-594; Sani, E., Barison, S., Pagura, C., Mercatelli, L., Sansoni, P., Fontani, D., Carbon nanohorns-based nanofluids as direct sun light absorbers (2010) Opt Express, 18, pp. 5179-5187; Mohammadnejad, M., Ghazvini, M., Javadi, F.S., Saidur, R., Estimating the exergy efficiency of engine using nanolubricants (2011) Energy Educ Sci Technol Part A Energy Sci Res, 27, pp. 447-454; Roberts, V., Raphael, N.O., Luiz, M., Ricardo, N.N.K., Using a heat pump as an alternative to support solar collector for water heating in Brazil (2012) Int J Air Conditioning Refrig, 20 (3); Amrollahi, A., Rashidi, A.M., Lotfi, R., Meibodi, M.E., Kashefi, K., Convection heat transfer of functionalized MWNT in aqueous fluids in laminar and turbulent flow at the entrance region (2010) Int Commun Heat Mass Transfer, 37, pp. 717-723; Kumaresan, V., Mohaideen Abdul Khader, S., Karthikeyan, S., Velraj, R., Convective heat transfer characteristics of CNT nanofluids in a tubular heat exchanger of various lengths for energy efficient cooling/heating system (2013) Int Commun Heat Mass Transfer, 60, pp. 413-421; Natarajan, E., Sathish, R., Role of nanofluids in solar water heater (2009) Int J Adv Manuf Technol, pp. 1-5; Shuichi, T., Experiment study on thermal transport phenomenon of nanofluids as working fluid in heat exchanger (2014) Int J Air Conditioning Refrig, 22 (1); Duffie, J.A., Bechman, W.A., (1980) Solar engineering of thermal processes, , John Wiley & Sons, New York; Kim, J.T., Ahn, H.T., Han, H., Kim, H.T., Chun, W., The performance simulation of all glass vacuum tubes with coaxial fluid conduit (2007) Int Commun Heat Mass Transfer, 34, pp. 587-597; Kim, Y., Seo, T., Thermal performances comparisons of the glass evacuated tube solar collectors with shapes of absorber tube (2007) Renew Energy, 32, pp. 772-795; Tian, Q., Thermal performance of the U-type evacuated glass tubular solar collector (2007) Build Energy Environ, 26 (3), pp. 51-54. , [in Chinese]; Tian, Q., Study on thermal efficiency and performance of U-tubular all-glass evacuated tube solar collector (2006) Energy Eng, 6, pp. 36-40; Wu, G.S., Yang, J.K., Ge, S.L., Wang, Y.J., Chen, M.H., Chen, Y.F., Thermal conductivity measurement for carbon-nanotube suspensions with the 3ω method (2009) Adv Mater Res, pp. 394-398; Xuan, Y., Roetzel, W., Conceptions of heat transfer correlation of nanofluids (2000) Int J Heat Mass Transfer, 43, pp. 3701-3707; Pak, B.C., Cho, Y.I., Hydrodynamic and heat transfer study of dispersed fluids with submicron metallic oxide particles (1998) Exp Heat Transfer, 11 (2), pp. 151-170; Shah, R.K., Thermal entry length solutions for the circular tube and parallel plates (1975) Proc. 3rd national heat mass transfer conference, , HMT-11-75; Brinkman, H.C., The viscosity of concentrated suspensions and solutions (1952) JChem Phys, 20, pp. 571-581; http://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/coalequivalent.htmWilson, L., Average electricity prices around the world: $/kWh http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/average-electricity-prices-kwhDing, Y., Alias, H., Wen, D., Williams, R.A., Heat transfer of aqueous suspensions of carbon nanotubes (CNT nanofluids) (2006) Int J Heat Mass Transfer, 49, pp. 240-250; Garg, P., Alvarado, J.L., Marsh, C., Carlson, T.A., Kessler, D.A., Annamalai, K., An experimental study on the effect of ultrasonication on viscosity and heat transfer performance of multi-wall carbon nanotube-based aqueous nanofluids (2009) Int J Heat Mass Transfer, 52, pp. 5090-5101",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929353253

Synthetic lead wastewater with concentrations of 10, 40 and 200ppm were treated. The results thus obtained indicated that effluent pH was an essential parameter in determining the efficiency of FBC and FBHC. A comparison between theoretical solubility and residual Pb in effluents revealed that FBHC in the predictable metastable region of pH 6.5-8.5 guaranteed 99% Pb removal and a crystallization ratio of 95% (CR%). XRD analysis suggested that the lead carbonate of FBHC products comprised either a cerussite (PbCO<inf>3</inf>) or a hydrocerussite (Pb<inf>3</inf>(CO<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf>(OH)<inf>2</inf>) phase, depending on pH. FBHC was proven to be effective in remediating lead wastewater under optimal hydraulic conditions (initial molar ratio of [Na<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf>]/[Pb]>1.2, upflow velocity=25-35mh-1 and pH<inf>e</inf>=7.2±0.4), which were all similar to those in FBC. The cross-section loading (L, kgm-2L-1) depended on the input Pb level; L was controlled at 0.15kgm-2 h-1 for treating 10ppm-Pb and was increased to 5.73kgm-2h-1 for 40 and 200ppm-Pb, optimizing the FBHC and FBC processes. Without the addition of seed materials, FBHC recovered purer lead carbonate than did FBC. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cerussite; Crystallization ratio; Hydraulic conditions; Hydrocerussite; Metastable region; Solubility","Fu, F., Wang, Q., Removal of heavy metal ions from wastewaters: a review (2011) J.

The main chemical buffer system of digested effluent is made up of high concentration of acidic species, which lead to a hypothesis that elevation of pH for ammonia release could be achieved by removing supersaturated CO<inf>2</inf>, dissolved carbonate, and bicarbonate solely. The concept was tested in lab scale reactors with digested dairy manure focusing on temperature, bubble size, liquid depth and airflow rate. It has demonstrated that simple air stripping without alkali chemical input is an effective way to elevate pH of the digested effluent due to intriguing chemical shifts strongly related to the high levels of carbon dioxide, bicarbonates and carbonates present in digested effluent. These chemical shifts, ultimately release carbon dioxide and raise the pH of the effluent to levels near 10, which with combined elevated operating temperatures from waste engine heat, can lead to 70-90% shift from ionic to free, gaseous form of ammonia and subsequent recovery of ammonia through acid contact. The chemical relationships and equilibrium shifts associated with the aeration process and its subsequent release of gases were further investigated by chemical equilibrium model. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aeration; Ammonia; Anaerobic digestion; Dairy manure; Modeling","Liao, W., Frear, C., Oakley, K., Chen, S., Leaching-bed reactor for producing stabilised plant growing media from dairy manure (2010) Biosyst.

In general, the run out table is fitted with laminar water jets where the achieved cooling rate is very less because of the Leidenfrost phenomenon. The current research is focused on the comparative study of the cooling processes; by using water jet and air atomized spray cooling techniques on the hot stationary and moving surface. The coolant used in both the cases is surfactant added water with varying concentration of surfactants. In case of stationary bed, the maximum cooling rates achieved for both jet and air atomized spray cooling are at a surfactant concentration of 225. ppm, the values being 167 and 224 °C/s, respectively. On the contrary, for moving surface, highest cooling rates of 163 and 127 °C/s are obtained at a low surfactant concentration of 75 ppm for jet and spray cooling respectively. It is interesting to observe that addition of surfactant has a negative effect on cooling rate for a hot moving surface. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Air atomized spray; Cooling rate; Critical heat flux; Moving surface; Ultrafast cooling","Al-Ahmadi, H.M., Yao, S.C., Spray cooling of high temperature metals using high mass flux industrial nozzles (2008) Exp.

Discovered in 1994 with wells on natural flow or through artificial lift, this field had produced 17.8×106 bbl of oil to date. It was noticed that gas oil ratio had increased in certain parts and oil production declined with time. This study was undertaken to better understand and optimize management and operation of this field. In this brief, we first reviewed the geology, petrophysical properties, and field production history of PSU field. We then evaluated current production histories with decline curve analysis, developed a numerical reservoir model through matching production and pressure data, then carried out parametric studies to investigate the impact of injection rate, injection locations, and timing of injection, and finally developed optimized improved oil recovery (OIR) methods based on ultimate oil recovery and economics. This brief provides an addition to the list of carbonate fields available in the petroleum literature and also improved understandings of Smackover formation and similar analogous fields. By documenting key features of carbonated oil field performances, we help petroleum engineers, researchers, and students understand carbonate reservoir performances.

In such configuration the effects of pressure waves cannot be neglected and therefore commonly used criteria for adjustment of PID governors would not be appropriate. A second-order Π model of the turbine-penstock based on a lumped parameter approach is considered. A correction factor is introduced in order to approximate the model frequency response to the continuous case in the frequency interval of interest. Using this model, several criteria are analysed for adjusting the PI governor of a hydropower plant operating in an isolated system. Practical criteria for adjusting the PI governor are given. The results are applied to a real case of a small island where the objective is to achieve a generation 100% renewable (wind and hydro). Frequency control is supposed to be provided exclusively by the hydropower plant. It is verified that the usual criterion for tuning the PI controller of isolated hydro plants gives poor results. However, with the new proposed adjustment, the time response is considerably improved. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Governor tuning; Long penstock; Pole placement method; Wind-hydro systems","Kaldellis, J., Kavadias, K., Christinakis, E., Evaluation of the wind - hydro energy solution for remote islands (2001) Energy Convers Manag, 42 (9), pp. 1105-1120;

We evaluated the extraction of succinic acid in situ by means of fluorescence measurements from segmented to dispersed flow allowing for localized extraction performance measurements in the reactor types. In addition, we evaluated the overall mass transfer rate in each reactor for similar flow rates showing the relevance of geometrical characteristics in the reactors. Furthermore, the results were correlated with the energy dissipation rate in the reactors for dispersed flow allowing for an easier scalability and performance comparison between several geometries. This correlation is fitted on two accounts, the specific interfacial area a=(c<inf>6</inf>σ/ρ)-0.6ε0.4 which was verified in situ allowing for a study of the reactors in respect to the generated droplet sizes and the overall mass transfer rate (k<inf>l</inf>) which was combined with the specific interfacial area correlation.

Seedy watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris; Joboni population) is irrigated by two methods including full and reduced irrigation systems in Iran. The objective of the present study was to compare seedy watermelon production in full (high input) and reduced (low input) irrigation systems in terms of irrigation water energy use efficiency (IWEUE), energy budget and economic analysis. Data were collected from 116 full irrigated and 93 reduced irrigated farms in northeast of Iran by using a face-to-face questionnaire in 2011-2012. The results showed that the total energy consumed under high input systems was 25625.94 MJ ha-1, whereas under low input was 3129.3 MJ ha-1. IWEUE and all of the energy indexes were improved in the reduced irrigation system compared to the full condition. The direct and renewable energies in the reduced irrigation system were higher than full irrigation. The economical analysis indicated that higher return was gained by the full irrigation system due to higher yield compared to the reduced irrigation system. Human labor had the highest impact on seedy watermelon among the other inputs based on the Cobb-Douglas production function. © 2014 The Authors.",,"Alam, M.S., Alam, M.R., Islam, K.K., Energy flow in agriculture: Bangladesh (2005) American J.

Here the terms aqua, geo and ponics means pond water, pond mud/soil and cultivation, respectively. Producing and regularly harvesting fish in shaded ponds and growing vegetables on surrounding dykes for household consumption was constrained. To overcome the difficulties, an IFCAS (3.66 m × 2.44 m = 9 m2) was set in each of 9 shaded ponds - 5 highly shaded ponds (HSP) and 4 moderately shaded ponds (MSP) - in which GIFT tilapia strain (Orechromis niloticus) was stocked at the rate of 100 m-3 cage. In the ponds, carp species (Catla catla, Labeo rohita, Cirrhinus cirrhosus and Cyprinus carpio) were stocked at the ratio of 1:2:2:1, and at the rate of 14,820 ha-1. Tilapia were fed floating feed and the carp were fed with supplementary feed. Vegetables were grown on the IFCAS scaffold, and tilapia were grown in the net-cage constructed underneath. Women members of HSP households participated fully in the action research in the production of vegetables and fish in IFCAS. Participating households started consuming vegetables and tilapia from IFCAS within 1.5 and 1 month of the start of the experiment, respectively. Average fish consumption of 20 kg household-1 was recorded within four months, of which more than 50% was tilapia from IFCAS. Overall fish and vegetable production was higher in MSP as compared to HSP. A financial analysis showed the benefit-cost ratio of IFCAS was >1, indicating the investment efficiency of IFCAS for farmers. © 2015 The Author.

The focus is set on dairy concentration processes, in which milk is defined as a mixture of water and four dry matter components (fat, proteins, carbohydrates, minerals) modelled as ""pseudo-components"" in a conventional simulator which has been adapted to take into account the behaviour of the liquid food product considered. The significant properties of milk (heat capacity, boiling point elevation, thermal conductivity, density, viscosity, surface tension) are modelled with empirical models found in the literature and implemented in the simulator. In order to validate the approach, an industrial milk evaporation process and a pilot-scale evaporator are modelled and simulated. The results are compared with industrial and experimental results respectively, and show a good agreement with the industrial process. However improvements are needed in modelling the pilot scale evaporator. The proposed approach is generic enough to be extended to other liquid foods. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bovine milk; Chemical process simulator; Evaporation; Food process simulation; Food product modelling","Alcântara, L.A.P., Fontan, R.D.C.I., Bonomo, R.C.F., Souza, Jr.E.C.D., Sampaio, V.S., Pereira, R.G., Density and dynamic viscosity of bovine milk affected by temperature and composition (2012) Int.

The classical design suffers of a very low hydraulic efficiency. The basic challenge is to increase the power output but not the rpms, with a desirable working regime in the range of 120-160 rpm. We study the hydraulic efficiency of waterwheels with analytical expressions and measured data from two laboratory scale designs in a variety of cases that differ in 1) blade inclination angle, 2) inclination angle of the water conduit, 3) blade geometry and 4) impact point of the waterjet on the blade surface. A waterwheel with blades with a notch in the upper edge does not improve the straight blade results. A very simple curved blade profile may enhance the hydraulic efficiency up to 46%. We analyze the performance of the new designs when applied to a real waterwheel located in the western Himalaya by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The maximum power delivered by the traditional wooden made waterwheel is 1.97 kW at 120 rpm. The waterwheel having 36 curved iron blades generates a power equal to 3.2 kW also at 120 rpm. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Computational fluid dynamics; Impulse-type turbine; Watermill; Waterwheel","Sharma, R.C., Bisht, Y., Sharma, R., Singh, D., Gharats (Watermills): indigenous device for sustainable development of renewable hydro-energy in Uttarakhand Himalayas (2008) Renew Energy, 33, pp. 2199-2206; Moritz, L., (1958) Grain-mills and flour in classical antiquity, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Vashisht, A.K., Current status of the traditional watermills of the Himalayan region and the need of technical improvements for increasing their energy efficiency (2012) Appl Energy, 98, pp. 307-315; Miller, G., Kauppert, K., Performance characteristics of water wheels (2004) J Hydraul Res, 42 (5), pp. 451-460; Denny, M., The efficiency of overshot and undershot waterwheels (2004) Eur J Phys, 25, pp. 193-202; Ikeda, T., Iio, S., Tatsuno, K., Performance of nano-hydraulic turbine utilizing waterfalls (2010) Renew Energy, 35, pp. 293-300; Williamson, S.J., Stark, B.H., Booker, J.D., Performance of a low-head pico-hydro Turgo turbine (2013) Appl Energy, 102, pp. 1114-1126; Cobb, B.R., Sharp, K.V., Impulse (Turgo and Pelton) turbine performance characteristics and their impact on pico-hydro installations (2013) Renew Energy, 50, pp. 959-964; Lahimer, A.A., Alghoul, M.A., Sopian, K., Amin, N., Asim, N., Fadhel, M.I., Research and development aspects of pico-hydro power (2012) Renew Sust Energy Rev, 16, pp. 5861-5878; Vicente, S., Bludszuweit, H., Flexible design of a pico-hydropower system for Laos communities (2012) Renew Energy, 44, pp. 406-413; Benecke, G.E., Success factors for the effective implementation of renewable energy options for rural electrification in Inda - potentials of the clean development mechanism (2008) Int J Energ Res, 32, pp. 1066-1079; Singh, K.M., Shrestha, L.K., (2010) Annual report, CRT/N, 2010, , Centre for Rural Technology, Nepal; Mahat, I., Implementation of alternative energy technologies in Nepal: towards the achievement of sustainable livelihoods (2004) Energy Sustain Dev, 8 (2), pp. 9-16; Sovacool, B.K., Bambawale, M.J., Gippner, O., Dhakal, S., Electrification in the Mountain Kingdom: the implications of the Nepal power development project (NPDP) (2011) Energy Sustain Dev, 15, pp. 254-265; Agarwal, S.K., Re-energizing watermills for multipurpose use and improved rural livelihoods (2006) Mt Res Dev, 26 (2), pp. 104-108; Bachmann, A., Traditional and new technology development in the Himalaya (1983) Mt Res Dev, 3 (1), pp. 65-70; Pujol, T., Solà, J., Montoro, L., Pelegrí, M., Hydraulic performance of an ancient Spanish watermill (2010) Renew Energy, 35, pp. 2019-2033; Joshi, C.D., Seshadri, V., Parametric study on the performance of an impulse-type water wheel (1987) IE(I) Journal-ME, 68, pp. 12-18; Pujol, T., Montoro, L., Silva, X., Hydraulic power of slow-rotating waterwheels: a novel analytical approximation (2011) P I Mech Eng C-J Mec, 225, pp. 1495-1506; Anagnostopoulos, J.S., Papantonis, D.E., Flow modeling and runner design optimization in Turgo water turbines (2007) Eng Technol, 28, pp. 206-211; Cumming, G., Fidler, F., Vaux, D.L., Error bars in experimental biology (2007) J Cell Biol, 177 (1), pp. 7-11; Fogiel, M., (1992) The fluid mechanics and dynamics problem solver: a complete solution guide to any textbook, , Research and Education Association, New York; White, F.M., (2011) Fluid mechanics, , McGraw-Hill, New York; Celik, I., Procedure for estimation and reporting of discretization error in CFD applications (1993) J Fluids Eng Editor Policy Statement Control Numer Accuracy J Fluids Eng, pp. 1-7; Pujol, T., Montoro, L., High hydraulic performance in horizontal waterwheels (2010) Renew Energy, 35, pp. 2543-2551; Williamson, S.J., Stark, B.H., Booker, J.D., Low head pico hydro turbine selection using a multi-criteria analysis (2014) Renew Energy, 61, pp. 43-50",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929574875

However, the initial instabilities which determine the primary break-up of the liquid sheet are not well understood. Lack of agreement on the influence of the boundary conditions and the non-dimension scaling of the initial instability persists between theoretical stability analyses and experiments, since there is little experimental data available on the near-field behaviour of the instability. To address this matter, we have undertaken an experimental parametric study of an aerodynamically-driven, non-swirling annular water sheet. The effects of sheet thickness, inner and outer gas-liquid momentum ratio were investigated over an order of magnitude variation in Reynolds and Weber number. From high-speed image correlation measurements in the near-nozzle region, we propose new empirical correlations for the frequency of the instability as a function of the total gas-liquid momentum ratio, with good non-dimensional collapse. From analysis of the instability velocity probability densities, we find two persistent and distinct superimposed instabilities with different growth rates. The first is a short-lived, rapidly saturating sawtooth-like instability. The second is a slower-growing stochastic instability which persists through the break-up of the sheet. The presence of multiple instabilities whose growth rates do not strongly correlate with the shear velocities may explain some of the discrepancies between experiments and stability analyses. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.","Annular liquid sheet instability; Experimental","Kawano, S., Hashimoto, H., Togari, H., Ihara, A., Deformation and breakup of an annular liquid sheet in a gas stream (1997) Atomizat.

Here we report results of a study of the influence of moisture incursion on dielectric relaxation and reliability in porous low-k (2.55) dielectric constant BEOL capacitors. We apply impedance spectroscopy to measure the dielectric loss tangent as a function of temperature and frequency. From the results, we identify two relaxation modes of water in the porous dielectric, exhibiting thermal activation energies of 0.32 eV and 0.56 eV. Study of the lifetime against time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) as a function of the dielectric loss tangent measured at AC voltages below 0.5 V yields an inverse power-law relationship. The dielectric loss tangent thus has the potential to serve as a low-voltage test of the susceptibility to early failure and to provide a link between high voltage, accelerated TDDB testing and the underlying physical processes responsible for dielectric breakdown. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

But the sensitivity of geysering to a variety of parameters is an important consideration in determining its effectiveness as a cooling mechanism. In this paper, an experimental study was made of geyser boiling performance in a vertical heated system with a long rising pipe and heat source located at the bottom. The effects of heat flux (2.0×104Wm-2≤Q<inf>in</inf>≤8.0×104Wm-2), subcooled temperature (5K<δT<inf>sub</inf><80K), coolant inventory (12.5%≤H<inf>v</inf>≤87.5%) and geometry ratio (L/D=55, 83) on the period and intensity of geyser boiling under the conditions with no circulation were investigated. Two vertical pipes of total length of 1750mm and 2650mm with inside and outside diameters of 32 and 38mm were employed with distilled water as a working fluid. Four flow patterns of bubbly flow, slug flow, churn flow and mist packet annular flow were observed and new definitions were proposed for the observed intermittent flow process through visualized method, i.e., thermal storage, subcooled boiling, superheated boiling, vapor eruption and liquid refilling. It was revealed that the period of geyser boiling decreased sharply by increasing the heat load until it became very low and then completely disappeared. The geyser period increased from approximately 23.9-58s by increasing the upper water subcooling from 5K to 78K but changed slightly as the coolant inventory ratio ranged from 12.5% to 87.5%. A larger geometry ratio was a favorable factor for geysering which illustrated that geysering occurred more easily at a larger geometry ratio. In addition, flow pattern map for two-phase flow conditions in vertical channels based on geometry ratios and input powers were presented. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Effective parameters; Flow patterns; Geyser periodicity; Two-phase flow instability; Vertical heated system","Baba, M., Fukushima accident: what happened (2013) Radiat.

This methodology consists of a sea state selection technique (MaxDiss), then this selected sea states are introduced into a numerical model in order to calculate the power performance. Finally this data are interpolated with a non linear technique (Radial Basis functions) in order to obtain the long term performance of a WEC on a long met-ocean data series with low computational requirements. In this paper, three types of converter, a one body heaving converter (follower), a two-body resonant converter as well as a deep water flap are investigated. Also four different locations with different met-ocean conditions in terms of the scatter plots and the sea conditions (swell-wind sea) distribution were selected (North of Spain, West of Denmark, Chile and West of Ireland). The methodology worked perfectly for all the selected alternatives, although it was demonstrated to work better for non-resonant converters that are not band limited in their frequency response. Also, the classical method of power production assessment based on the power matrix was reviewed, analysing the analytical spectrum assumption. The influence of more than one peak spectrum on the power production was found to be large on a sea state by sea state basis (±200%) but also on the Annual Energy Production (±40%). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Long-term; Met-ocean; Power matrix; Sea state; Spectrum; Wave energy converter","Andres, A.D., Guanche, R., del Jesus, F., Vidal, C., Losada, I.J., Time domain model of a teo body heave converter: model and applications (2013) Ocean Eng, 72, pp. 116-123; Guanche, R., de Andres, A., Simal, P.D., Vidal, C., Losada, I.J., Uncertainty analysis of wave energy farms financial indicators (2014) Renew Energy, 68, pp. 570-580; Snarey, M., Terrett, N.K., Willett, P., Wilton, D.J., Comparison of algorithms for dissimilarity-based compound selection (1997) JMol Graph Model, 15, pp. 372-385; Franke, R., Scattered data interpolation: tests of some method (1982) Math Comput, 38, pp. 181-200; Camus, P., Mendez, F., Medina, R., Cofiño, A., Analysis of clustering and selection algorithms for the study of multivariate wave climate (2011) Coast Eng, 58, pp. 453-462; Babarit, A., Hals, J., Muliawan, M.J., Kurniawan, A., Moan, T., Krokstad, J., Numerical benchmarking study of a selection of wave energy converters (2011) Renew Energy, 41; Kerbiriou, M., Prevosto, M., Maisondieu, C., Babarit, A., Clement, A., Influence of an improved sea-state description on a wave energy converter production (2007) Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Artic Engineering, , [San Diego, California, USA]; Kerbiriou, M., Prevosto, M., Maisondieu, C., Clement, A., Babarit, A., Influence of sea-states description on wave energy production (2007) Proceedings of the European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference, , [Porto]; Saulnier, J., Clement, A., Falcao, A., Pontes, T., Prevosto, M., Ricci, P., Wave groupiness and spectral bandwidth as relevant parameters for the performance assessment of wave energy converters (2011) Ocean Eng, 38 (1); Saulnier, J., Prevosto, M., Maisondieu, C., Refinements of sea state statistics for marine renewables: a case study from simultaneous buoy measurements in Portugal (2011) Renew Energy, 36 (11); Falnes, J., (2002) Ocean waves and oscillating systems, , Cambridge University Press; (2000) Goda Random seas and design of maritime structures, 133, p. 367. , equation 10; http://www.seatricity.net/, Seactricity.

Free radicals are thought to be the key intermediates in the ultrasound processing of wine, but their nature has not been established yet. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin trapping with 5,5-dimethyl-l-pyrrolin N-oxide (DMPO) was used for the detection of hydroxyl free radicals and 1-hydroxylethyl free radicals. Spin adducts of hydroxyl free radicals were detected in DMPO aqueous solution after sonication while 1-hydroxylethyl free radical adducts were observed in ultrasound-processed red wine and model wine. The latter radical arose from ethanol oxidation via the hydroxyl radical generated by ultrasound in water, thus providing the first direct evidence of the formation of 1-hydroxylethyl free radical in red wine exposed to ultrasound. Finally, the effects of ultrasound frequency, ultrasound power, temperature and ultrasound exposure time were assessed on the intensity of 1-hydroxylethyl radical spin adducts in model wine. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","EPR; Free radical; Model wine; Spin trapping; Ultrasound; Wine","Mason, T.J., Paniwnyk, L., Lorimer, J.P., The uses of ultrasound in food technology (1996) Ultrason.

The aim of this study was to investigate the energy use efficiency in four double cropping systems including: wheat-silage corn (W-SC), barely-silage corn (B-SC), barely-grain corn (B-GC) and barely-rice (B-R) in the arid regions of Isfahan province, Iran. Data used in this study were collected from 73, 45, 38, 18, 18 wheat, barley, silage corn, grain corn and rice farms, respectively, personal interview using semi-structured questionnaire during 2010. The results indicated that the total energy consumed were 140,422, 128,979, 121,360 and 172,962 MJ ha-1 for the W-SC, the B-GC, the B-SC and the B-R cropping systems, respectively. The share of diesel fuel by 43.36% (W-SC), 43.93% (B-GC), 42.82% (B-SC) and 49.40 % (B-R) was the highest input. This was followed by fertilizer (W-SC: 24.70%, B-GC: 25.12%, B-SC: 27.05 and B-R: 16.11) and water (W-SC: 10.54%, B-GC: 11.76%, B-SC: 10.73 and B-R: 13.85), respectively. The energy use efficiency was found as 1.70 for W-SC, 1.65 for B-GC, 1.64 for B-SC and 1.03 for B-R double cropping systems, respectively. According to the research results the W-SC, B-SC, B-GC and B-R double cropping systems were more efficient in terms of energy, respectively. © 2014 The Authors.","Cereal; Double cropping; Energy efficiency; Environmental health; Productivity; Specific energy","Alam, M.S., Alam, M.R., Islam, K.K., Energy flow in agriculture: Bangladesh (2005) Am.

For all ZnO samples, the XRD studies reveal a hexagonal wurtzite structure, without supplementary diffraction lines. The particle size is influenced by the type of plant extract used and varies between 14 and 70 nm. The biomolecules involved in the biosynthetic procedure was evidenced by FTIR spectroscopy. The presence of Mn and Fe in ZnO powders synthesized by using plant extracts was highlighted by ICP-MS. The EPR spectroscopy confirms the presence of Fe3+ and Mn2+ ions in ZnO samples and its variation depending on the plant extract. Also, Zn vacancy complexes and oxygen vacancies are present in all analyzed samples. A narrowing of the band gap for the ZnO prepared with plant extracts was observed as compared to that of the ZnO, prepared using solely ultrapure water. The photodegradation studies conducted in the presence of UV light irradiation indicated that ZnO nanoparticles prepared using garlic extract exhibit the highest efficiency in the photodegradation of methylene blue dye. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Green synthesis; Photocatalytic properties; Plant extract; Zinc oxide nanoparticles","Akhtar, M.S., Panwar, J., Yun, Y.S., (2013) ACS Sustain.

The formation consists of carbonates with some evaporite intercalations that developed on a gently sloping homoclinal carbonate ramp facing the Late Permian Paleo-Tethys Ocean. This study focuses on the Kish Gas Field (Zagros offshore basin situated between Iran and Qatar), and is based on a 222-m-thick continuous core. Based on the integration of core- and wireline-log data coupled with petrographic analyses of 580 thin sections, three major depositional environments (facies belts) with 11 carbonate microfacies are identified. These include (1) sabkha to tidal flat (laminated to massive anhydrite, dolomudstone with anhydrite nodules, dolomudstone, and intraclastic dolowackestone), (2) lagoon and leeward shoals (bioclastic wackestone/dolowackestone to packstone, and peloid dolopackstone and peloid-bioclastic dolopackstone), and (3) mobile (windward) sand shoal (ooid-peloid dolograinstone, ooid dolograinstone, ooid-intraclast dolograinstone, ooid-bioclast dolograinstone-packstone, and coarse bioclast-intraclast dolograinstone). Diagenetic evolution of the Upper Dalan Formation is associated with evaporative marine, shallow-water normal-marine, meteoric, and burial diagenetic environments. Common diagenetic effects include dolomite and calcite cementation, mechanical and chemical compaction, dissolution, dolomitization, and evaporative (anhydrite) mineralization. Reservoir quality is strongly affected by variations in the original rock fabrics and subsequent diagenetic alterations. The most common pore types include interparticle, moldic, and connected vug (fracture and cavernous). The interparticle porosity-permeability relationship for the studied facies suggests that the reservoir quality is not affected by different crystal sizes and most samples plot in the low porosity and low to high permeability field, or display Lucia class 1 or 2 petrophysical relationships. The study shows that the pervasive pore-filling anhydrite mineralization lead to a significant decrease in porosity and permeability; poikilotopic anhydrite cement reduced matrix porosity, but the pore size was less affected. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbonate diagenesis; Carbonate ramp; Carbonate-evaporite reservoir; Kish Gas Field; Upper Dalan Formation; Zagros","Adabi, M.H., Salehi, M.A., Ghabeishavi, A., Depositional environment, sequence stratigraphy and geochemistry of Lower Cretaceous carbonates (Fahliyan Formation), south-west Iran (2010) J.

To enhance water removal, certain flow-fields induce cross-flow, or flow through the gas-diffusion layer (GDL) via channel-to-channel pressure differences. While beneficial to water removal, cross-flow comes at the cost of higher pumping pressures and may lead to membrane dehydration and other deleterious issues. This paper examines the impact of cross-flow on component saturation levels as determined through in-plane high-resolution neutron radiography. Various humidities and operating conditions are examined, and the results demonstrate that cell saturation levels correlate strongly with the level of cross-flow rate, and lower GDL saturation levels are found to correlate with an increase in permeability at higher flow rates. Effective water removal is found to occur at channel-to-channel pressure gradients greater than the measured breakthrough pressure of the GDL, evidence that similar liquid-water transport mechanisms exist for under-land area transport as in transverse GDL flow. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Breakthrough pressure; Cross-flow; Fuel cells; Gas-diffusion layer; Liquid-water saturation; Neutron radiography; Permeability","Bernardi, D.M., Verbrugge, M.W., Mathematical-model of a gas-diffusion electrode bonded to a polymer electrolyte (1991) Aiche J., 37 (8), pp. 1151-1163; Springer, T.E., Zawodzinski, T.A., Gottesfeld, S., Polymer electrolyte fuel-cell model (1991) J.

However, removing substrates in the post purification stage is difficult, during which harsh reagents are used and the substrates are usually consumed undesirably. In this paper, we report that universal sodium carbonate (Na<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf>) particles can effectively promote the construction of well-structured graphene frameworks based on a quick thermal decomposition of fumaric acids. Notably, the Na<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf> particles are easily separated from graphene through a simple and green method, namely, washing with water at room temperature. Together with the reused characteristic of the recovered Na<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf> particles, this approach is undoubtedly beneficial to the low-cost and clean synthesis of graphene. Benefiting from the framework structure, the as-synthesized graphene exhibits excellent performance in the supercapacitor. The specific capacitance of the GFs-modified electrode was calculated to be 242 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, which was almost twice that of the RGO-modified electrode (134 F g-1). More importantly, the GFs-modified electrode maintained 92.6% retention of its initial specific capacitance (from current density of 0.5 to 16 A g-1), which was much higher than that of 2D graphene-modified electrode. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Framework; Graphene; Rate capability; Supercapacitors; Water-soluble substrate","Novoselov, K.S., Geim, A.K., Morozov, S.V., Jiang, D., Zhang, Y., Dubonos, S.V., Grigorieva, I.V., Firsov, A.A., (2004) Science, 306, pp. 666-669; Novoselov, K.S., Fal'ko, V.I., Colombo, L., Gellert, P.R., Schwab, M.G., Kim, K., (2012) Nature, 490, pp. 192-200; Geim, A.K., (2009) Science, 324, pp. 1530-1534; Zhu, Y., James, D.K., Tour, J.M., (2012) Adv.

Specifically in S-FF coating magnetic nanoparticles with a suitable surfactant provides steric repulsions to prevent particles agglomeration. Selecting the function of surfactant can be engineered according to its application. In the present study, for the first time the application of S-FF in dispersive solid phase extraction of methylene blue (as a cationic dye model) in water and shrimp samples was investigated. For this purpose, in order to use ionic liquid as carrier fluid, the surface of Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> nanoparticles was coated by an anionic surfactant in a polar medium to form a hydrophilic layer around magnetic nanoparticles. In addition to hydrophobic interactions between the analyte and carbonic chain of surfactant, the retention of cationic dye was mainly governed by attractive electrostatic interactions between polar head of surfactant and dye. Under optimized conditions, the relative standard deviation is 2.9%, the limit of detection is 2.5 μg L-1, and the preconcentration factor is 135. ©2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, its use as a nutraceutical ingredient is compromised by its low water solubility, chemical stability, and bioavailability. Encapsulation of resveratrol in protein nanoparticles can be used to overcome these issues. Fluorescence quenching experiments were used to study the interaction of resveratrol with gliadin and zein. Resveratrol interacted with both proteins, but the binding constant was higher for zein than for gliadin at 35 °C. Furthermore, binding between resveratrol and gliadin increased at higher temperatures, which was not observed for zein. Analysis of the thermodynamic parameters suggested that resveratrol-gliadin binding mainly occurs through hydrophobic interactions while the binding with zein is predominantly mediated through hydrogen bonds. These results help rationalise ingredient selection and production of protein nanoparticles and microparticles for encapsulation, protection and release of resveratrol and potentially other bioactive compounds. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Preliminary lab-scale experiments were conducted to determine the optimum extraction temperature and mixing ratio of water and ethanol for the pilot-scale extraction. The maximum yield of curcuminoids in the pilot-scale system was 13.58% (curcumin 4.94%, demethoxycurcumin 4.73%, and bisdemethoxycurcumin 3.91% in dried extracts) at 135 °C/5 min with water/ethanol mixture (50:50, v/v) as a solvent. On the other hand, the extraction yields of curcuminoids were obtained as 10.49%, 13.71% and 13.96% using the 50%, 95% and 100% ethanol, respectively, at the atmospheric condition (60 °C/120 min). Overall results showed that the subcritical solvent extraction is much faster and efficient extraction method considering extracted curcuminoids contents and has a potential to develop a commercial process for the extraction of curcuminoids. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The Se treatments showed dual response, 10 μM of Se significantly increased growth, water relations, photosynthetic attributes along with carbonic anhydrase activity whereas its higher concentrations proved inhibitory in concentration dependent manner. The follow-up application of EBL to the Se stressed plants improved growth, water relations, photosynthesis and simultaneously enhanced the various antioxidant enzymes viz. catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase with the excess accumulation of proline. In addition to this, 10 μM Se increases the efficacy of 10-8 M of EBL and both in combination showed maximum increase for the growth and photosynthetic traits of plants. On the other hand, the elevated level of antioxidant enzymes as well as proline could have conferred tolerance to the Se-stressed plants resulting in improved growth, water relations and photosynthesis. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A variety of fruit infusions: apple red delicious (apple (rd)) (Malus domestica), Mcintosh apple (apple (i)) (Malus pumila), sweet lemon (Citrus limetta) and mango (Magnifera indica) were studied. Effect of water, organic solvents and five different aqueous surfactant formulations viz. SDS, Brij-35, Brij-58, Triton X-100 and Span-40 were explored for the extraction of TPC and determining the antioxidant activity (AA). The TPC and AA (%) were determined using Folin-Ciocalteu (FCA) and DPPH assay, respectively. The effect of surfactant type, concentration and common organic solvents on the extraction of TPC and AA (%) was studied using UV-visible spectrophotometric technique. Among all the extracting systems employed, Brij-58 showed the highest extraction efficiency. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

When orange peel was pretreated by SE at 0.8 MPa for 7 min, combined with 0.8% SAS, the content of SDF was increased from 8.04% to 33.74% in comparison to the control and SDF prepared with SE-SAS showed the high water solubility, water-holding capacity, oil-holding capacity, swelling capacity, emulsifying activity, emulsion stability and foam stability. SDF from orange peel treated by SE-SAS exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher binding capacity for three toxic cations (Pb, As and Cu) and smaller molecular weight (Mw = 174 kDa). Furthermore, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement showed that SDF from orange peel treated by SE-SAS had a higher peak temperature (170.7 ± 0.4 °C) than that of the untreated sample (163.4 ± 0.3 °C). Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) images demonstrated that the surface of SDF from orange peel treated by SE-SAS was rough and collapsed. It can be concluded that SDF from orange peel treated by SE-SAS has the higher potential to be applied as a functional ingredient in food products.","Orange peel; Physicochemical properties; Soluble dietary fiber Steam explosion; Sulfuric-acid soaking","(2010) American Association of Cereal Chemistry International, , AACC Method 32-45 St Paul MN; Abdul-Hamid, A., Luan, Y.S., Functional properties of dietary fiber prepared from defatted rice bran (2000) Food Chemistry, 68, pp. 15-19; Alvira, P., Tomás-Pejó, E., Ballesteros, M., Negro, M.J., Pretreatment technologies for an efficient bioethanol production process based on enzymatic hydrolysis: A review (2010) Bioresource Technology, 101, pp. 4851-4861; (2001) Official Methods of Analysis, , AOAC 17th ed.

In this study, 67 kinds of soybean cultivars were selected, and correlation analysis was conducted between physicochemical indexes of these soybean cultivars and flavor characteristic indexes of soymilk. With clustering analysis, all the soybean cultivars could be classified into three classes, and according to the results of principal component analysis for each class of soymilk flavor characteristics, the soymilk of second class had relatively heavier beany and non-beany flavor, and the third class had weaker flavor. For soybean cultivars of which the soymilk characteristics were unknown, two discriminant functions could be used to predict flavor characteristics if the physicochemical indexes were known. Therefore, screening of soybean cultivars suitable for soymilk processing can be targeted for the flavor favored by consumers and an evaluation method established. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Physicochemical and antioxidant properties of flours were determined using standard methods. Protein, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and antioxidant properties of rice flours increased after germination while phytic acid and total starch contents decreased. Foaming capacity and stability of rice flours increased after germination. Germination resulted to changes in pasting and thermal characteristics of rice flours. Germinated rice flours had better physicochemical and antioxidant properties with reduced phytic acid and starch contents compared to MR 219, which can be utilized as functional ingredients in the preparation of rice-based products. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, raw water, finished water, and tap water from a water plant in Wuhan, China were collected in two different sampling times of the year (January and July). Genotoxic effects of water extracts were evaluated using a combination of three different bioassays: SOS/umu test, HGPRT gene mutation assay, and micronucleus assay, which were separately used to detect DNA damage, gene mutation, and chromosome aberration. The results of three different bioassays showed that all water samples in January and July induced at least one types of genotoxic effects, of which the DNA-damage effects were all detectable. The levels of DNA-damage effects and gene-mutation effects of finished water and tap water in January were higher than those in July. Chlorination could increase the DNA-damage effects of drinking water in January and the gene-mutation effects of drinking water in both January and July, but did not increase the chromosome-aberration effects of drinking water in both January and July. Our results highlighted the importance of using a combination of different bioassays to evaluate the genotoxicity of water samples in different seasons. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Disinfection by-products; Genotoxic effect; HGPRT gene mutation assay; Micronucleus assay; SOS/umu test","Koivusalo, M., Vartiainen, T., Hakulinen, T., Pukkala, E., Jaakkola, J.J., Drinking water mutagenicity and leukemia lymphomas, and cancers of the liver, pancreas, and soft tissue (1995) Arch.

Its sustainable usage and the maintenance of a good quality are essential for an intact environment, human life and a stable economy. Emerging technologies aim for a continuous monitoring of water quality, overcoming periodic analytical sampling, and providing information on the current state of inshore waters in real time. So does the here presented cell-based sensor system which uses RLC-18 cells (rat liver cells) as the detection layer for the detection of water pollutants. The electrical read-out of the system, cellular metabolism, oxygen consumption and morphological integrity detects small changes in the water quality and indicates a possible physiological damage caused. A generalized functional linear model was implemented in order to regress the chemicals present in the sample on the electrical read-out. The chosen environmental pollutants to test the system were chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate pesticide, and tetrabromobisphenol A, a flame retardant. Each chemical gives a very characteristic response, but the toxicity is mitigated if both chemicals are present at once. This will focus our attention on the statistical approach which is able to discriminate between these pollutants. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cell-based sensor; Chlorpyrifos; Generalized functional linear model; Tetrabromobisphenol A; Water quality monitoring","Betts, K., (2013) Environ.

Heavy metals in water resources can come from various industrial activities, and drinking water can be ex-post contaminated by heavy metals such as Cu2+ from house fittings (e.g., water reservoirs) and pipes. Here, we present a new copper biosensor capable of detecting copper ions at concentrations of 1-100μM. This biosensor is based on cells of a specifically modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain immobilized in alginate beads. Depending on the concentration of copper, the biosensor beads change color from white, when copper is present in concentrations below the detection limit, to pink or red based on the increase in copper concentration. The biosensor was successfully tested in the determination of copper concentrations in real samples of water contaminated with copper ions. In contrast to analytical methods or other biosensors based on fluorescent proteins, the newly designed biosensor does not require specific equipment and allows the quick detection of copper in many parallel samples. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Alginate beads; Contaminated water; Copper ion detection; Purine synthesis pathway; Yeast biosensor","Abe, A., Yamashita, S., Noma, A., Sensitive, direct colorimetric assay for copper in serum (1989) Clin.

The role of matching water affinities between oppositely charged headgroups has been explored. Both the headgroups of AS and CTAB are soft, they are matched in water affinities, while the headgroups of SL and CTAB are mismatched in water affinities due to the hard headgroup of SL. At lower temperature, the degree of matching in water affinities between oppositely charged headgroups is a crucial factor influencing the synergism, self-assembly of wormlike micelles and their rheological behaviors: in comparison with the SL/CTAB/H<inf>2</inf>O system, the AS/CTAB/H<inf>2</inf>O system shows much stronger synergism in zero-shear viscosity η<inf>0</inf>, stronger ability of wormlike micelles formation and elongation, much higher scission energy, much longer relaxation time and lower plateau modulus.

Box 36155-316, Shahrood, Iran","In this work, a flow injection analysis (FIA) method was introduced for the determination of trace amounts of thiourea in tap water. This method is based upon the inhibition effect of thiourea on the reaction between meta-cresol purple (MCP) and potassium bromate catalyzed by bromide ions in a sulfuric acid medium. In the presence of thiourea, an induction period appears in the reaction system, and as a result, the absorbance of MCP increases at 525 nm in the FIA manifold. The chemical and FIA variables are studied and optimized using the univariate and Simplex optimization methods. Under the optimum conditions, thiourea can be determined in the range of 0.100-13.0 μg mL-1. The limit of detection (3σ) for thiourea was found to be 0.0310 μg mL-1. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) for six replicate determinations of 0.500, 5.00, and 12.0 μg mL-1 of thiourea were 4.0%, 1.8%, and 1.2%, respectively. The proposed method was also applied for the determination of thiourea in orange juice and orange peel samples with recoveries in the range of 98.0-101%. The analytical speed of the method was calculated to be about 120 sample per hour. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, CoMn<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> could maintain its catalytic activity in the repeated batch experiments. Moreover, HO and SO<inf>4</inf>- radicals participating in the process were evidenced using quenching experiments, and a rational mechanism was proposed. PMS oxidation with CoMn<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> is an efficient technique for remediation of organic contaminants in wastewater. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cobalt manganese oxides; Fenton-like; Organic pollutant; Peroxymonosulfate; Sulfate radical","Yao, Y., Cai, Y., Lu, F., Wei, F., Wang, X., Wang, S., Magnetic recoverable MnFe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> and MnFe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-graphene hybrid as heterogeneous catalysts of peroxymonosulfate activation for efficient degradation of aqueous organic pollutants (2014) J.

The method is based on the diazotization-coupling reaction of nitrite with cefixime and 1-naphthylamine in an acidic solution (Griess reaction). The final product that is an azo dye has an orange color with maximum absorption at 360 nm which Beer's Law is obeyed over the concentration range 0.02-15.00 mg L-1 of nitrite. Optimal conditions of the variables affecting the reaction were obtained by central composite design (CCD). A detection limit of 4.3 × 10-3 mg L-1 was obtained for determination of nitrite by the proposed method. The proposed method was successfully applied to determine nitrite in soil and water samples. The molar absorptivity of the product of the reaction and RSD in determination of nitrite in real samples are 4.1 × 103 (L mol-1 cm-1) and lower than 10%, respectively. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","1-Naphthylamine; Cefixime; Diazotization; Nitrite; Spectrophotometric","US EPA Drinking Water Standards and Health Advisorie, (2004) Drinking Water Standards and Health Advisories, , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Washington, DC, EPA 822-R-04-005; López Pasquali, C.E., Gallego-Picó, A., Fernández Hernando, P., Velasco, M., Durand Alegría, J.S., Two rapid and sensitive automated methods for the determination of nitrite and nitrate in soil samples (2010) Microchem.

Meanwhile, another micro polyester fiber was investigated as comparison. It was found that kapok fibers exihibited low surface energy of 40.64mN/m with highly hydrophobicity and oil wettability. It had high water contact angle up to 151°, adsorbing four oils with average droplet size varying from emulsified state(0.1-25μm) to dispersed state (25-100μm). The average adhesive energies of kapok to four oils were 3.78×10-11-9.40×10-11J, with the highest for vegetable oil. Compared with kapok, polyester fiber adsorbed a large number of smaller oil droplets with their average size within emulsified state for its large specific surface area contributed by micro-fine of the fiber, but showed bad adhesiveness to retain the adsorbed oils with average droplet adhesive energy among 1.49×10-11-2.27×10-11J due to its relative higher surface energy of 59.15mN/m.

The sensing behavior was demonstrated by UV-vis experiments and NMR studies. This sensory system exhibited prominent visual color change toward cyanide ion over other testing anions in DMSO (90%) solvent, with a 1:1 binding stoichiometry and a detection limit down to 3.6×10-8molL-1. Sensor reveals specific anti-jamming activity and reversible in the presence of Cu2+ ions. This concept has been applied to design a logic gate circuit at the molecular level. Further we developed coated graphite electrode using probe 3 as ionophore and studied the performance characteristics of electrode. The sensitivity of ratiometric-based colorimetric assay is below the 1.9μM, accepted by the World Health Organization as the highest permissible cyanide concentration in drinking water. So it can be applied for both quantitative determination and qualitative supervising of cyanide concentrations in real samples. © 2015.","Coated graphite electrode; Colorimetric sensor; Logic gate; Ratiometric sensor","Anzenbacher, P., Tyson, D.S., Jursíková, K., Castellano, F.N., Luminescence lifetime-based sensor for cyanide and related anions (2002) J.

The lack of accurate information about the environmental impact of these excavated rocks and foaming agents added during the excavation process has aroused increasing concern for ecosystems and human health. The present study proposes an integrated approach to the assessment of the potential environmental impact of three foaming agents containing different anionic surfactants and other polymers currently on the market and used in tunnel boring machines. The strategy includes chemical characterization with high resolution mass spectrometry techniques to identify the components of each product, the use of in silico tools to perform a similarity comparison among these compounds and some pollutants already listed in regulatory frameworks to identify possible threshold concentrations of contamination, and the application of a battery of ecotoxicological assays to investigate the impact of each foaming mixture on model organisms of soil (higher plants and Eisenia andrei) and water communities (. Daphnia magna). The study identified eleven compounds not listed on the material safety data sheets for which we have identified possible concentrations of contamination based on existing regulatory references. The bioassays allowed us to determine the no effect concentrations (NOAECs) of the three mixtures, which were subsequently used as threshold concentration for the product in its entirety. The technical mixtures used in this study have a different degree of toxicity and the predicted environmental concentrations based on the conditions of use are lower than the NOAEC for soils but higher than the NOAEC for water, posing a potential risk to the waters due to the levels of foaming agents in the muck. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental toxicology; Phytotest; Soil conditioning agents; Tunneling","Oreste, P., Castellano, M., An applied study on the debris recycling in tunneling (2012) Am.

Moss is sensitive to heavy metals and is therefore considered a pollution indicator. However, it is unknown what kind physiological parameters can indicate metal contaminations quickly and non-invasively. Here, we systematically examined the effects of six heavy metals on physiological parameters and photosynthetic activities of two moss species grown in aquatic media or moist soil surface. We suggest that a phenotype with anthocyanin accumulation pattern and chlorosis pattern and two chlorophyll fluorescence parameters with their images can roughly reflect metal species groups, concentrations and differences between the two moss species. In other words, metal contaminations could be roughly estimated visually using the naked eye. Enzymatic and non-enzymatic anti-oxidative abilities and photosynthetic protein contents of Eurhynchium eustegium were higher than those of Taxiphyllum taxirameum, indicating their differential metal tolerance. Neither anti-oxidative abilities nor photosynthetic proteins were found to be ideal indicators. This study provides new ideas to monitor heavy metals rapidly and non-invasively in water or on wetland and moist soil surface. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Anthocyanin; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Heavy metal monitoring; Moss; Physiological parameters","Bruns, I., Friese, K., Markert, B., Krauss, G.J., The use of Fontinalis antipyretica L. ex Hedw. as a bioindicator for heavy metals. 2.

In the absence of Hg2+ and Pb2+, GF intercalated with the FNA and released moderate strong fluorescence. While in the presence of Hg2+ or Pb2+, the FNA would be induced to form T-Hg2+-T or G-quadruplex structure, interacted with which the GF would exhibit extremely strong or very weak fluorescence. By monitoring the fluorescence changes upon addition of these two ions, the Hg2+ and Pb2+ could be selectively detected as low as 3.23ppb and 2.62ppb. As the main advantage of this assay is simplicity and the feasibility was demonstrated by detecting Hg2+ and Pb2+ in spiked water samples, this assay holds great potential for the development of a cost effective and useful tool for environmental monitoring. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Fluorescent assay; Functional nucleic acid; G-quadruplex; Hg2+ detection; Pb2+ detection; T-Hg2+-T","Cai, S., Lao, K., Lau, C., Lu, J., (2011) Anal.

The QSPR models are developed using molecular descriptors computed through quantum mechanical methods including ab-initio as well as advanced semi-empirical methods. The predictivity of the developed models is tested through state-of-the-art external validation procedures employing an external prediction set of compounds. To analyse the role of instantaneous interactions between electrons (the electron-correlation), the models are also compared with those developed using only the electron-correlation contribution of the quantum chemical descriptor. The electron-correlation contribution towards the chemical hardness and the LUMO energy are observed to be the best predictors for octanol-water partition coefficient, whereas for the octanol-air partition coefficient, the total electronic energy and electron-correlation energy are found to be reliable descriptors, in fact, even better than the polarisability. For aqueous solubility of PCNs, the absolute electronegativity is observed to be the best predictor. This work suggests that the electron-correlation contribution of a quantum-chemical descriptor can be used as a reliable indicator for physico-chemical properties, particularly the partition coefficients. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aqueous solubility; Electron-correlation; Partition-coefficients; Persistent organic pollutants; QSPR; Quantum chemical descriptors","Domingo, J.L., Polychlorinated naphthalenes in animal aquatic species and human exposure through the diet: a review (2004) J.

Nevertheless, each EOR technique suffers from a number of limitations. Surfactant flooding, which is a conventional EOR method, can cause emulsification and displacement of the trapped oil in the reservoir. Surfactants are the most expensive components in a microemulsion. Therefore, selecting a proper surfactant formulation which can mobilize oil without considerable surfactant adsorption is very important. The application of ultrasound is one of the unconventional EOR methods. This causes emulsification of oil and water in the reservoir. Integration of surfactant flooding and ultrasound has the potential to decrease surfactant consumption. Therefore, in the case of integrated ultrasound-surfactant flooding, the phase behavior of surfactant-brine-oil, herewith referred to as the SBO system, is crucial and needs to be investigated. In this study, the effect of ultrasonic stimulation duration on the phase behavior of an SBO system was investigated, and changes in solubilization parameters and optimal salinities are discussed. By comparing the results of the phase behavior of SBO under short and long durations of ultrasonic stimulation, it was concluded that a short duration of stimulation (15. min) yields more volume of microemulsion compared to cases using no ultrasound and a longer duration of ultrasound stimulation. Therefore, by using short durations of ultrasonic stimulation in the integrated ultrasound-surfactant flooding process, the interfacial tension remains low and the surfactant consumption decreases. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Enhanced oil recovery; Microemulsion; Phase behavior; Surfactant flooding; Ultrasonic waves","Gogarty, W.B., Status of surfactant or micellar methods (1978) J.

The increased viscosity of gel brings a negative effect on surface tension which reduces the gel enhanced foam volume. In turn, the increased viscosity could enhance the thickness and strength of foam film which increases foam stability and plugging capacity in porous media. The morphology results show that the gel enhanced foam has a thicker bubble film which enhances its foam stability. The effect of injection mode, gas-liquid ratio, gas injection velocity and formation permeability on the plugging capacity was investigated by single sand-pack experiments. When the gas-liquid ratio and gas injection velocity were respectively set at 1:1 and 0.5. ml/min, co-injection of gel enhanced foaming solution and gas could obtain a better plugging capacity in high permeability sand-packs. Parallel sand-pack experiments show that the profile improvement capacity of high formation permeability ratio is much better than that of low formation permeability ratio. The visual simulation experiment was also conducted to illustrate the flowing behavior of gel enhanced foam. By Jiamin effect or Jamin superimposed effect, directly plugging and bridging in the large pore space, the gel enhanced foam can effectively reduce the permeability of porous media in high permeability zones and divert fluid into low permeability zones, thus increases the swept volume. The treatment has been successfully used in Henan oilfield of China which provides a reference to water production control in other similar high temperature oilfields. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Gel enhanced foam; In-depth profile control; Oilfield application; Plugging capacity; Stability","Patek, T.W., Field applications of steam foam for mobility improvement and profile control (1996) SPE Reserv.

The probe is N,N′-bis(pyridoxal phosphate)-o-phenylenediamine (BPPP). It was synthesized by utilizing the Schiff base condensation reaction of pyridoxal 5-phosphate with 1,2-phenylenediamine. BPPP has the properties of high fluorescence stability, good water solubility and low toxicity. Its maximum excitation wavelength and maximum fluorescence emission wavelength are at 389 and 448 nm, respectively. When BPPP coexists with copper (II), its fluorescence is dramatically quenched. Under a certain condition, the fluorescence intensity decreased proportionally to the concentration of copper (II) by the quenching effect. Based on this fact, we established a fluorescence quenching method for the determination of copper (II). Under optimal conditions a linear range was found to be 0.5-50 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.2 ng/mL. The method has been applied to determine copper (II) in foodstuff samples and the analytical results show good agreement with that obtained from atomic absorption spectrometry method. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.","Copper (II); Fluorescence; Foodstuff; N,N′-bis(pyridoxal phosphate)-o-phenylenediamine; Quenching","Gaggelli, E., Kozlowski, H., Valensin, D., Valensin, G., (2006) Chem.

The length of hydrophobic PSt block chain was found to affect the critical micelle concentration, the micelle aggregation number, and the cloud point. O/W emulsions were obtained through the PIT process using PSt<inf>n</inf>-b-POEGMA<inf>m</inf>-Cl as a surfactant by lowering the temperature of emulsions below the PIT in an ice bath. PSt particles with precisely controlled size in a range between 30 and 120nm were successfully prepared by a free radical polymerization of St droplets initiated by the water- or oil-soluble initiators.

A series of experiments were performed to investigate the mechanisms and factors controlling the H<inf>2</inf>S release. Results of this study show that: (1) the biomass and activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in sludge were the major factors controlling the amount of H<inf>2</inf>S release, (2) the sludge drying temperature had an important effect on both the extent and the timing of H<inf>2</inf>S release from the sludge, and (3) decreasing sludge pH increased the H<inf>2</inf>S release. Based on the findings from this study, a new system that integrates sludge drying and H<inf>2</inf>S gas treatment was developed, by which 97.5% of H<inf>2</inf>S and 99.7% of smoke released from sludge treatments was eliminated. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","H<inf>2</inf>S release; Sewage sludge; Sludge drying; Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB)","Alexander, L.G., Sulfur adsorption Bu, X., Ying, Y., Ji, X., Zhang, C., Peng, W., New development of Zinc-based sorbents for hot gas desulfurization (2007) Fuel Process.

To natural cellulose based flocculants, utilization of hazardous cellulose solvent and simplification of synthetic procedure are the two urgent problems needing to be further improved. In this work, a series of natural dicarboxyl cellulose flocculants (DCCs) were one-step synthesized via Schiff-base route. The cellulose solvent (NaOH/Urea solution) was utilized during the synthesis process. The full-biodegradable flocculants avoid causing secondary pollution to environment. The chemical structure and solution property of the DCC products were characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, TGA, FESEM, charge density and ζ-potential. Kaolin suspension and effluent from paper mill were selected to evaluate the flocculation activity of the DCCs. Their flocculation performance was compared with that of commercial cationic polyacrylamide and poly aluminium chloride flocculants. The positive results showed that the NaOH/Urea solvent effectively promoted the dialdehyde cellulose (DAC) conversion to DCC in the one-step synthesis reaction. The DCCs with the carboxylate content more than 1mmol/g exhibited steady flocculation performance to kaolin suspension in the broad pH range from 4 to 10. Its flocculation capacity to the effluent from paper mill also showed excellent. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Dicarboxyl cellulose; Flocculation activity; Hazardous solvent utilization; Natural flocculant; One-step synthesis","Fu, F.L., Wang, Q., Removal of heavy metal ions from wastewaters: a review (2011) J.

Photoluminescence intensity and fluorescence lifetime was decreasing with increasing CQ concentration. Dynamic light scattering technique found the hydrodynamic diameter of QD suspension in water is in range of 45 nm, whereas in presence of CQ increased to mean values of 67 nm. Calculated from absorption peak position of excition band indicated on average QD size of 3.2 nm. Emission spectroscopy and time-resolved emission studies confirmed preservation of electronic band structure in QD-CQ aggregates. On basis of the presented results, the elucidated mechanism of QD fluorescence quenching is a result of the interaction between QD and CQ due to electron transfer and electrostatic attraction. The results of fluorescence quenching of water-soluble CdTe quantum dot (QD) capped with thiocarboxylic acid were used to implement a simple and fast method to determine the presence of native antioxidant quinones in aqueous solutions. Feasibility studies on this method carried out with oxidized catechin showed a linear relation between the QD emission and quencher concentration, in range from 1 up to 200 μM. The wide linear range of concentration dependence makes it possible to apply this method for the fast and sensitive detection of quinones in solutions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The B[a]P extractability by the four methods decreased with ageing and a first-order exponential model could be used to describe the kinetics of release. Correlation of the kinetic rate constant with major soil properties showed a significant effect of clay and sand contents and pore volume fraction (<6nm) on sequestration of the desorbable fraction (by HPCD) and the water-extractable fraction. Analysis of 14C-B[a]P in soils after ageing showed a limited loss of B[a]P via degradation. Fractionation of B[a]P pools associated with the soil matrix was analysed according to extractability of B[a]P by the different extraction methods. A summary of the different fractions is proposed for the illustration of the effect of ageing on different B[a]P-bound fractions in soils. This study provides a better understanding of the B[a]P ageing process associated with different fractions and also emphasises the extraction capacity of the different methods employed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Ageing; B[a]P; Extractability; Fractionation; Model","Toxicological profile for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (1995), In: A.A.f.T.S.a.D.

Raman bands at 1049 and 1072 cm-1 are assigned to the carbonate symmetric stretching mode. This observation supports the concept of the non-equivalence of the carbonate units in the structure of aerinite. Multiple infrared bands at 1354, 1390 and 1450 cm-1 supports this concept. Raman bands at 933 and 974 cm-1 are assigned to silicon-oxygen stretching vibrations.

Calixarenes as macrocycles have drawn intensive interests for fields such as biomedicine, supramolecular chemistry and smart materials. Here, instead of the normal complicated modification strategy, a facile and efficient method for one-pot synthesis of calix[4]arene crown ether (CCE4) capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) is proposed. The as-prepared CCE4-AuNPs are not only high water dispersity and stability even after storage for 3 months, but also capable of host-guest recognition of diamines in aqueous systems. Size-selective encapsulation of amine group between CCE4 and diamines carry out the aggregation of CCE4-AuNPs. The determination of diamines such as hexamethylenediamine or spermine can be realized by the UV-vis absorbance change and visual color difference. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Biosensors; Calix[4]arenes; Diamines; Gold nanoparticles; Host-guest recognitions; Spermines","Acharya, A., Samanta, K., Rao, C.P., (2012) Coordin.

However, electrochemical detection of proteases, such as botulinum neurotoxin type E (BoNT/E), that cleave a peptide bond between two specific amino acid residues is challenging. This study reports a facile and sensitive electrochemical method for BoNT/E detection. The method is based on a two-step proteolytic cleavage using a target BoNT/E light chain (BoNT/E-LC) and an externally supplemented exopeptidase, l-leucine-aminopeptidase (LAP). BoNT/E-LC cleaves a peptide bond between arginine and isoleucine in IDTQNRQIDRI-4-amino-1-naphthol (oligopeptide-AN) to generate isoleucine-AN. Subsequently, LAP cleaves a bond between isoleucine and AN to liberate a free electroactive AN species. The liberated AN participates in electrochemical-chemical-chemical (ECC) redox cycling involving Ru(NH<inf>3</inf>)<inf>6</inf>3+, AN, and a reducing agent, which allows a high signal amplification. Electrochemical detection is carried out without surface modification of indium-tin oxide electrodes. We show that dithiothreitol is beneficial for enhancing the enzymatic activity of BoNT/E-LC and also for achieving a fast ECC redox cycling. An incubation temperature of 37°C and the use of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer resulted in optimal signal-to-background ratios for efficient BoNT/E detection.

As the melt season progresses, the subglacial hydrologic system drains supraglacial meltwater more efficiently, decreasing basal water pressure and moderating the ice velocity response to surface melting. However, limited direct observations of subglacial water pressure mean that the spatiotemporal evolution of the subglacial hydrologic system remains poorly understood. Here we show that ice velocity is well correlated with moulin hydraulic head but is out of phase with that of nearby (0.3-2 kilometres away) boreholes, indicating that moulins connect to an efficient, channelized component of the subglacial hydrologic system, which exerts the primary control on diurnal and multi-day changes in ice velocity. Our simultaneous measurements of moulin and borehole hydraulic head and ice velocity in the Paakitsoq region of western Greenland show that decreasing trends in ice velocity during the latter part of the melt season cannot be explained by changes in the ability of moulin-connected channels to convey supraglacial melt. Instead, these observations suggest that decreasing late-season ice velocity may be caused by changes in connectivity in unchannelized regions of the subglacial hydrologic system. Understanding this spatiotemporal variability in subglacial pressures is increasingly important because melt-season dynamics affect ice velocity beyond the conclusion of the melt season. ©2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Here we show that recently isolated Arabidopsis thaliana β-carbonic anhydrase double mutants (ca1 ca4) exhibit an inversion in their response to elevated CO<inf>2</inf>, showing increased stomatal development at elevated CO<inf>2</inf> levels. We characterized the mechanisms mediating this response and identified an extracellular signalling pathway involved in the regulation of CO<inf>2</inf>-controlled stomatal development by carbonic anhydrases. RNA-seq analyses of transcripts show that the extracellular pro-peptide-encoding gene EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR 2 (EPF2), but not EPF1 (ref. 9), is induced in wild-type leaves but not in ca1 ca4 mutant leaves at elevated CO<inf>2</inf> levels. Moreover, EPF2 is essential for CO<inf>2</inf> control of stomatal development. Using cell-wall proteomic analyses and CO<inf>2</inf>-dependent transcriptomic analyses, we identified a novel CO<inf>2</inf>-induced extracellular protease, CRSP (CO<inf>2</inf> RESPONSE SECRETED PROTEASE), as a mediator of CO<inf>2</inf>-controlled stomatal development. Our results identify mechanisms and genes that function in the repression of stomatal development in leaves during atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> elevation, including the carbonic-anhydrase-encoding genes CA1 and CA4 and the secreted protease CRSP, which cleaves the pro-peptide EPF2, in turn repressing stomatal development. Elucidation of these mechanisms advances the understanding of how plants perceive and relay the elevated CO<inf>2</inf> signal and provides a framework to guide future research into how environmental challenges can modulate gas exchange in plants. ©2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Ltd., NoidaUttar Pradesh, India","Abstract The deficit in electricity and high diesel costs affects the pumping requirements of community water supplies and irrigation; so using solar energy for water pumping is a promising alternative to conventional electricity and diesel based pumping systems. Solar water pumping is based on photovoltaic (PV) technology that converts solar energy into electrical energy to run a DC or AC motor based water pump. The main objective of the study is to present a comprehensive literature review of solar pumping technology, evaluate the economic viability, identify research gaps and impediments in the widespread propagation of solar water pumping systems and technology. The study focuses on update on solar water pumping technology, performance analysis, optimum sizing, degradation of PV generator supplying power to pump, economic and environmental aspects and advances in PV materials and efficiency improvements. An update on the current state of research and utilization of solar water pumping technology is presented. Factors affecting performance of PV water pumping system, degradation of PV modules and efficiency improving techniques of PV water pumping systems are identified. Solar water pumping is found to be economically viable in comparison to electricity or diesel based systems for irrigation and water supplies in rural, urban and remote regions. The investment payback for some PV water pumping systems is found to be 4-6 years. The recent Indian incentives for PV pumping and policy initiatives for the promotion of solar water pumping in developing countries are also discussed. Potential follow-up research areas are also identified. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Irrigation; Performance analysis; Photovoltaics; PV degradation; Solar energy; Solar water pumping","Foster, R., Majid, G., Cota, A., A test book of solar energy (2014) Renew Energy Environ, , http://www.amazon.com/Solar-Energy-Renewable-Environment, [accessed 07.06.14];

The experimental setup and main parameters of the L625 lidar for water vapor measurement are first presented, then the measurement principle of water vapor and data processing methods are introduced. The water vapor measurement precision of the lidar system was analyzed by comparison with radiosonde. Monthly and seasonal water vapor profiles were built by analyzing 2000-2008 lidar data. In the vertical direction, results show that water vapor content decreases gradually with height. The more the water vapor content in the low atmosphere, the faster the decay rate with altitude. As far as monthly variation, the water vapor content first increases and then decreases with month. The maximum content of water vapor appears in July, at mixing ratio of 15.6. g/kg at 1. km. The seasonal variability of water vapor content is rather obvious. In summer the water vapor mixing ratio reaches up to 15.0. g/kg at 1. km, and in winter it is only 3.9. g/kg at the same altitude. Interannual variation of water vapor content differs between seasons (as revealed in the standard deviation of data) where summer is least stable and autumn is the most stable. Precipitable water vapor is calculated from water vapor mean profiles at 1-4. km and the relationship between precipitable water vapor and precipitation is also investigated. A clear positive correlation is found with Pearson correlation coefficients (R) 0.933 between monthly precipitation and mean precipitable water vapor, as well a clear positive correlation between seasonal precipitation and seasonal mean precipitable water vapor (R. =. 0.988). Precipitation conversion efficiency (PCE) is calculated from precipitation and precipitable water vapor. The monthly PCE reaches its maximum in October at 25.8%, and drops to its minimum in January at 11.5%. Seasonal PCE's minimum is 15.2% in autumn and 23.7% in winter, at maximum. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Lidar; Precipitable water vapor; Variation characteristic; Water vapor mixing ratio","Barkidija, S., Fuchs, Z., Precipitation correlation between convective available potential energy, convective inhibition and saturation fraction in middle latitudes (2013) Atmos.

Assessing water use (WU) and water productivity (WP) will contribute to regional water management and grain production improvement. This paper quantifies the water use and productivity in grain production for 31 Chinese provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities (PAMs) by distinguishing between irrigated and rain-fed farmland. An indicator of marginal productivity of blue water (MWP<inf>b</inf>) is established and calculated to evaluate irrigation profits. National water use (WU<inf>t</inf>) for grain cultivation from 1998 to 2010 was approximately 689.04Gm3 (42.26% blue water and 57.74% green water). The productive water proportions for irrigated and total croplands were 65.57% and 76.85%, respectively. Water use compositions from both blue-green and productive-unproductive perspectives changed slightly over time. The water use productivity (WPU) and water consumption productivity (WPC) for integrated grain products of China during the study period were 0.747 and 0.972kg/m3, respectively. The spatial distribution patterns of irrigated WPs (WPU<inf>I,</inf> WPC<inf>I</inf>) were consistent with those for total cropland. China has achieved sufficient food supply without increasing water use. The national MWP<inf>b</inf> was estimated to be 0.673kg/m3, revealing a higher increase in crop yield on irrigated land compared to rain-fed land. The northeast provinces urgently need to improve irrigation efficiency, and the North China Plain PAMs should promote rain-fed crop yield to increase grain production and control water use in the future. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","China; Food security; Green-blue water; Irrigation district; Marginal productivity of blue water; Water productivity","Ali, M.K., Klein, K.K., Water use efficiency and productivity of the irrigation districts in southern Alberta (2014) Water Resour.

Catchments selected have distinct vegetative cover (grass, native vegetation or pine) and contrasting texture of the surface soil horizon (sand or clay loam/clay). Water samples were collected from three slope positions (upper, middle, and lower) at soil depths of ~. 30. cm and ~. 60. cm in addition to overland flows. Filtered (0.45. μm) water samples were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV-visible absorbance and by F-EEM and HPSEC with UV and fluorescence detection to characterize the DOM. Surface and sub-surface runoff from catchments with clay soils and native vegetation or grass had lower DOC concentrations and lower relative abundances of aromatic, humic-like and high molecular weight organics than runoff from sandy soils with these vegetative types. Sub-surface flows from two catchments with Pinus radiata had similar DOC concentrations and DOM character, regardless of marked variation in surface soil texture. Runoff from catchments under native vegetation and grass on clay soils resulted in lower DOC concentrations and hence would be expected to have lower coagulant demand in conventional treatment for potable water supply than runoff from corresponding sandy soil catchments. However, organics in runoff from clay catchments would be more difficult to remove by coagulation. Surface waters from the native vegetation and grass catchments were generally found to have higher relative abundance of organic compounds amenable to removal by coagulation compared with sub-surface waters. Biophysical and land management practices combine to have a marked influence on the quality of source water used for domestic supply. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Fluorescence-EEM; Land use; Molecular weight; Organic carbon; Sub-surface flow; Surface runoff","Ågren, A., Buffam, I., Jansson, M., Laudon, H., Importance of seasonality and small streams for the landscape regulation of dissolved organic carbon export (2007) J.

The experiment was performed by spilling five different amounts of liquid nitrogen at different release rates and initial water temperatures. The vaporization mass fluxes of liquid nitrogen were determined directly from the mass loss measured during the experiment. A variation of initial vaporization fluxes and a subsequent shift in heat transfer mechanism were observed with changes in initial water temperature. The initial vaporization fluxes were directly dependent on the liquid nitrogen spill rate. The heat flux from water to liquid nitrogen determined from experimental data was validated with two theoretical correlations for convective boiling. It was also observed from validation with correlations that liquid nitrogen was found to be predominantly in the film boiling regime. The substantial results provide a suitable procedure for predicting the heat flux from water to cryogenic liquids that is required for source term modeling. © 2015.","Convective boiling; Liquid nitrogen; LNG; Source term; Vaporization","Drake, E.M., Jeje, A.A., Reid, R.C., Transient boiling of liquefied cryogens on a water surface I.

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of water availability in the soil on the sporulation of Claroideoglomus etunicatum, Gigaspora albida and Scutellospora heterogama, and the influence of this condition on the infective potential and number of nuclei in glomerospores of these species. The reduction of water availability from 75 to 25% did not decrease significantly the sporulation of C. etunicatum, but resulted in decrease of sporulation of G. albida (600 to 7 glomerospores per 30g-1 soil) and S. heterogama (274 to 2 glomerospores per 30g-1 soil). The water availability at 75 and 71% promoted maximum sporulation of G. albida and S. heterogama, respectively. While G. albida and S. heterogama had greater sporulation than C. etunicatum, the infective potential of these species was lower, which may be related to the life-strategy and type of infective propagules of each species. The number of nuclei per glomerospore varied only among the species (p<0.05), with C. etunicatum and G. albida presenting the higher number of nuclei when compared to S. heterogama, but no differences were found among the treatments of water availability (p>0.05). These results suggest that AMF have distinct sporulation strategies and the amount of glomerospores is not directly related to the infectivity of the inoculum. Possibly, the differences in the life-strategies among the species were greater than the effects of water availability. © 2015.","Inoculum potential; Nuclei; Sorghum bicolor; Sporulation; Water deficiency","Angelard, C., Colard, A., Niculita-Hirzel, H., Croll, D., Sanders, I.R., Segregation in a mycorrhizal fungus alters rice growth and symbiosis-specific gene transcription (2010) Curr.

The major staple diet in South Asia, rice, was chosen to study its interaction with UO<inf>2</inf>2+, the active uranium species in water, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Highest uptake limit was checked by cooking rice at very high uranium concentration and it was found to be good scavenger of uranium. To gain insight into the mechanism of uptake, direct interaction of UO<inf>2</inf>2+ with monosaccharides was also studied, using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry taking mannose as a model. The studies have been done with dissolved uranium salt, uranyl nitrate hexahydrate (UO<inf>2</inf>(NO<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf>·6H<inf>2</inf>O), as well as the leachate of a stable oxide of uranium, UO<inf>2</inf>(s), both of which exist as UO<inf>2</inf>2+ in water. Among the eight different rice varieties investigated, Karnataka Ponni showed the maximum uranium uptake whereas unpolished Basmati rice showed the minimum. Interaction with other foodstuffs (potato, carrot, peas, kidney beans and lentils) with and without NaCl affected the extent of chemical interaction but was not consistent with the carbohydrate content. Uranium interaction with d-mannose monitored through ESI-MS, under optimized instrumental parameters, identified the peaks corresponding to uranyl adduct with mannose monomer, dimer and trimer and the species were confirmed by MS/MS studies. The product ion mass spectra showed peaks illustrating water loss from the parent ion as the collision energy was increased, an evidence for the strong interaction of uranium with mannose. This study would constitute the essential background for understanding interaction of uranium with various foods. Extension of this work would involve identification of foodstuff as green heavy metal scavengers. © 2015.","ESI-MS; ICP-MS; Uranium contamination; Uranium-rice interaction; Uranyl-carbohydrate adducts","Mandal, B.K., Suzuki, K.T., Arsenic round the world: a review (2002) Talanta, 58, pp. 201-235; Sankar, M.U., Aigal, S., Maliyekkal, S.M., Chaudhary, A., Anshup, A.A., Kumar, K., Chaudhari, Pradeep, T., Biopolymer-reinforced synthetic granular nanocomposites for affordablepoint-of-use water purification (2013) Proc.

To establish a technique that enables quality estimation during processing, we investigated the effects of hot water treatment on the electrical properties, cell membrane structure and texture of potato tubers. After hot water treatment at 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 °C, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and penetration tests were conducted. In addition, the EIS results were analyzed by use of an equivalent circuit. Obtained equivalent circuit parameters (intracellular resistance, extracellular resistance and cell membrane capacitance) increased or decreased with immersion time at high temperatures. CLSM images indicated that electrical changes were caused by cell membrane damage. Textural changes were strongly correlated with the equivalent circuit parameters. We suggest that EIS is useful to assess the degree of softening of potato during heating. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A fixed porous bed was placed beneath the room's floor to store the heat. To increase the heat storing capacity, water tanks was also used. The room with attached sunspace was built and tested in Karaj (Iran). Results illustrated that applying water tanks in the sunspace had a noticeable role in heat storing capacity. For example, the porous bed together with water tanks saved at least 37% (up to 87%) of energy cost compared to 10% (up to 15%) saved energy cost without water tanks. In addition, the simulation of annual thermal performance of the room by Energy-Plus software confirmed the applicability of the used configuration of sunspace along with added water tanks and porous bed made form arranged bricks as heat storing media a step forward to a completely green room (net zero energy building). The sunspace with water tanks showed a more stable condition (lower temperature variations) which is a base of thermal comfort. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","EnergyPlus; Net zero energy building; Porous bed; Solar energy; Sunspace; Thermal comfort","Rabah, K., Development of energy-efficient passive solar building design in Nicosia Cyprus (2005) Renew Energy, 30 (6), pp. 937-956; Aksoy, U.T., Inalli, M., Impacts of some building passive design parameters on heating demand for a cold region (2006) Build Environ, 41 (12), pp. 1742-1754; Bakos, G.C., Tsagas, N.F., Technology, thermal analysis and economic evaluation of a sunspace located in northern Greece (2000) Energy Build, 31, pp. 261-266; Mihalakakou, G., On the use of sunspace for space heating/cooling in Europe (2002) Renew Energy, 26, pp. 415-429; Oliveti, G., Simona, M., Ruffolo, S., Solar contribution evaluation for building attached sunspace in the Mediterranean climate (2005) International conference passive and low energy cooling for the built environment, Santorini, Greece; Oliveti, G., De Simone, M., Ruffolo, S., Evaluation of the absorption coefficient for solar radiation in sunspaces and windowed rooms (2008) Sol Energy, 82, pp. 212-219; Oliveti, G., Arcuri, N., De Simone, M., Bruno, R., Solar heat gains and operative temperature in attached sunspaces (2012) Renew Energy, 39, pp. 241-249; Mottard, J., Fissore, A., Thermal simulation of an attached sunspace and its experimental validation (2007) Sol Energy, 81, pp. 305-315; Rempel, A.R., Rempel, A.W., Cashman, K.V., Gates, K.N., Page, C.J., Shaw, B., Interpretation of passive solar field data with EnergyPlus models: un-conventional wisdom from four sunspaces in Eugene, Oregon (2013) Build Environ, 60, pp. 158-172; Bataineh, M.K., Fayez, N., Analysis of thermal performance of building attached sunspace (2011) Energy Build, 43, pp. 1863-1868; Sánchez-Ostiz, A., Monge-Barrio, A., Domingo-Irigoyen, S., González-Martínez, P., Design and experimental study of an industrialized sunspace with solar heat storage (2014) Energy Build, 80, pp. 231-246; Alonso, M.J., Liu, P., Mathisen, H.M., Ge, G., Simonson, C., Review of heat/energy recovery exchangers for use in ZEBs in cold climate countries (2015) Build Environ, 84, pp. 228-237; McKinstray, R., Lim, J.B.P., Tanyimboh, T.T., Phan, D.T., Sha, W., Brownlee, A.E.I., Topographical optimisation of single-storey non-domestic steel framed buildings using photovoltaic panels for net-zero carbon impact (2015) Build Environ, 86, pp. 120-131; Santamouris, M., Kolokotsa, D., Passive cooling dissipation techniques for buildings and other structures: the state of the art (2013) Energy Build, 57, pp. 74-94; Galvin, R., Are passive houses economically viable?

Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was used to quantify inorganic species in wastewater and river samples using a method based on EPA Method 200.7 rev4.4. A total of 53 emission lines from 30 elements (Al, As, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Se, Si, Sn, Sr, Ti, Tl, V, and Zn) were investigated. Samples were prepared by microwave-assisted acid digestion using a mixture of 2% HNO<inf>3</inf> and 0.5% HCl. Lower interferences and better detection characteristics resulted in selection of alternative wavelengths for Al, As, Sb, Mg, Mo, and Na. Radial view measurements offered accurate determinations of Al, Ba, K, Li, Na, and Sr in high-brine samples. Spike recovery studies and analyses of reference materials showed 80-105% recoveries for most analytes. This method was used to quantify species in samples with high to low brine concentrations with method detection limits a factor of 2 below the maximum contaminant limit concentrations of national drinking water standards. Elements B, Ca, K, Li, Mg, Na, and Sr were identified as potential tracers for the sources impacting PDWS intakes. Usability of the ICP-OES derived data for factor analytic model applications was also demonstrated. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Conventional and unconventional oil and natural gas wastewaters; Electric power generating stations wastewaters; Hydraulic fracturing; Inorganic elemental composition; Public drinking water intakes","Abualfaraj, N., Gurian, P.L., Olson, M.S., Characterization of Marcellus shale flowback water (2014) Environ.

In these fields, to meet the demand of measuring capacitances within the range of low values, ECT still needs relatively high requirements of designing its system. In this work, an ECT system is simplified to probe anomalous objects in water with high permittivity. Additionally, the relative change ratio (RCR) of capacitances is presented for image reconstruction in terms of the high permittivity background. RCR is the change value of a capacitance divided by its background value. To verify the effectiveness of the simplification of an ECT system and the method of RCR for image reconstruction, simulations and experiments associated with media of high permittivity (i.e. water) were conducted. The obtained results demonstrate that the simplified ECT system based on RCRs of simulated and measured capacitances is capable of effectively probing anomalous objects in tap-water and sodium chloride solutions with different concentrations. Therefore the RCR is recommended when the sensing domain of ECT is of the high permittivity background. Besides the simplification of ECT systems can be appealing and beneficial to introduced ECT into other fields associated with water flows, such as hydrology, hydrogeology, hydroponics, environment science, etc. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Anomalous objects; Electrical capacitance tomography; Relative change ratio; Simplification; Water","Huang, S., Plaskowski, A., Xie, C., Beck, M., Capacitance-based tomographic flow imaging system (1988) Electron Lett, 24, pp. 418-419; Ismail, I., Gamio, J., Bukhari, S.A., Yang, W., Tomography for multi-phase flow measurement in the oil industry (2005) Flow Meas Instrum, 16, pp. 145-155; Ostrowski, K., Luke, S., Williams, R., Simulation of the performance of electrical capacitance tomography for measurement of dense phase pneumatic conveying (1997) Chem Eng J, 68, pp. 197-205; Waterfall, R., He, R., White, N., Beck, C., Combustion imaging from electrical impedance measurements (1996) Meas Sci Technol, 7, pp. 369-374; Wang, H., Senior, P., Mann, R., Yang, W., Online measurement and control of solids moisture in fluidised bed dryers (2009) Chem Eng Sci, 64, pp. 2893-2902; Warsito, W., Fan, L.-S., Dynamics of spiral bubble plume motion in the entrance region of bubble columns and three-phase fluidized beds using 3D ECT (2005) Chem Eng Sci, 60, pp. 6073-6084; Bennett, M., Luke, S., Jia, X., West, R., Williams, R., Analysis and flow regime identification of bubble column dynamics (1999) Proc 1st World Congr Ind Process Tomogr Buxton, Derbyshire, UK, pp. 14-17; Wajman, R., Fiderek, P., Fidos, H., Jaworski, T., Nowakowski, J., Sankowski, D., Metrological evaluation of a 3D electrical capacitance tomography measurement system for two-phase flow fraction determination (2013) Meas Sci Technol, 24, pp. 1-11; Xie, C., Huang, S., Lenn, C., Stott, A., Beck, M., Experimental evaluation of capacitance tomographic flow imaging systems using physical models (1994) IEE Proc G Circ Dev Syst, 141, pp. 357-368; Loser, T., Petritsch, G., Mewes, D., Investigation of the two-phase countercurrent flow in structured packings using capacitance tomography (1999) Proc 1st World Congr Ind Process Tomogr Buxton, Derbyshire, UK, pp. 354-361; Jaworski, A., Bolton, G., The design of an electrical capacitance tomography sensor for use with media of high dielectric permittivity (2000) Meas Sci Technol, 11, pp. 743-757; Demori, M., Ferrari, V., Strazza, D., Poesio, P., A capacitive sensor system for the analysis of two-phase flows of oil and conductive water (2010) Sens Actuators A - Phys, 163, pp. 172-179; Strazza, D., Demori, M., Ferrari, V., Poesio, P., Capacitance sensor for hold-up measurement in high-viscous-oil/conductive-water core-annular flows (2011) Flow Meas Instrum, 22, pp. 360-369; Yang, W., Design of electrical capacitance tomography sensors (2010) Meas Sci Technol, 21, p. 042001; Yang, W.Q., Peng, L., Image reconstruction algorithms for electrical capacitance tomography (2003) Meas Sci Technol, 14, pp. R1-R13; Huang, S., Plaskowski, A., Xie, C., Beck, M., Tomographic imaging of two-component flow using capacitance sensors (1989) J Phys E - Sci Instrum, 22, pp. 173-177; Yang, W., York, T., New AC-based capacitance tomography system (1999) IEE Proc Sci Meas Technol, 146, pp. 47-53; Marashdeh, Q., Fan, L.-S., Du, B., Warsito, W., Electrical capacitance tomography - a perspective (2008) Ind Eng Chem Res, 47, pp. 3708-3719; Neumayer, M., Zangl, H., Watzenig, D., Fuchs, A., Current reconstruction algorithms in electrical capacitance tomography (2011) New Developments and Applications in Sensing Technology, pp. 65-106. , Springer, M.

Samples were collected in two campaigns (May and November, 2012) and analyzed by different extraction procedures followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry determination. The presence of linear isomers (4-n-octylphenol and 4-n-nonylphenol) was scarcely observed whereas branched isomers (4-tert-octylphenol and nonylphenol) were measured in almost all samples. Wastewater treatment plant effluents and nautical, fishing and agricultural activities are considered the primary source of pollution of the river by alkylphenols. The presence of bisphenol A in the river could be mainly associated to punctual sources of contamination from industrial discharges. A decrease in the total concentration of phenolic compounds in water was observed from spring to autumn (from 0.888μgL-1 in May to 0.05μgL-1 in November), while similar values were shown in C. fluminea samples from the two campaigns (1388 and 1228ngg-1 dw in spring and autumn, respectively). In sediments, the total concentration of the target compounds varied between 13 and 4536ngg-1 dw (average of 1041ngg-1 dw). Sediment-water partition coefficient (K<inf>d</inf>), bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) were estimated and highest values were obtained for nonylphenol. Calculated risk quotients showed low and moderate risk for the aquatic environment from the presence of the target compounds at all sampling points. The estimation of the daily intake of the studied compounds via water and biota ingestion indicated no risk for human health. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Alkylphenols; Bisphenol A; Directive 2013/39/EU; Environmental quality assessment; Human health impact; Minho River","(2000) Methodology for Deriving Ambient Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Human Health; Ahn, Y.G., Shin, J.H., Kim, H.Y., Khim, J., Lee, M.K., Hong, J., Application of solid-phase extraction coupled with freezing-lipid filtration clean-up for the determination of endocrine-disrupting phenols in fish (2007) Anal.

NaAsO<inf>2</inf> showed a weak reducibility and was easier to be controlled compared to other common quenchers including NaHSO<inf>3</inf>, ascorbic acid, Na<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>3</inf> and Na<inf>2</inf>S<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>. Due to the different oxidizing abilities among the species in total residual chlorine, NaAsO<inf>2</inf> can selectively and completely quench the strong oxidizing residual chlorine parts (free chlorine, NH<inf>2</inf>Cl, NHCl<inf>2</inf> and some organic chloramines) but leave the weak or no oxidizing parts for the quantification as ineffective chlorine. During the chlorination of Suwannee River humic acid, ineffective chlorine formation increased from <0.02 to 0.08mg/L (as Cl<inf>2</inf>) as the dissolved organic carbon of humic acid increased from 0 to 15mg-C/L. Finished water samples from three drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) and one tap water sample were collected to examine the presence of ineffective chlorine. The quantified ineffective chlorine ranged from 3.3% to 27.8% of the total residual chlorine. Formation of ineffective chlorine was positively correlated with the dissolved organic nitrogen concentration in drinking water. As the reaction time increased from 4 to 48h, the ineffective chlorine in the finished water from DWTP1 (water source: Yangtze River) was fairly stable at 0.15mg/L as Cl<inf>2</inf>, and its proportion in total residual chlorine increased from 27.8% to 78.9%. The ineffective chlorine was verified to be much weaker than free chlorine, NH<inf>2</inf>Cl and NHCl<inf>2</inf> in Escherichia coli inactivation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Disinfection efficacy; Dissolved organic nitrogen; Ineffective chlorine; Organic chloramines; Residual chlorine; Selective quenching method","White, G.C., (1992) The Handbook of Chlorination and Alternative Disinfectants, , Van Nostrand Reinhold; Harrington, G.W., Noguera, D.R., Bone, C.C., Kandou, A.I., Oldenburg, P.S., Regan, J.M., van Hoven, D., (2003) Ammonia from Chloramines Decay: Effects on Distribution System Nitrification, , AwwaRF and AWWA, Denver, CO; Helbling, D.E., VanBriesen, J.M., Free chlorine demand and cell survival of microbial suspensions (2007) Water Res., 41, pp. 4424-4434; Morris, J.C., Kinetics of reactions between aqueous chlorine and nitrogen compounds (1967) Principles and Applications of Water Chemistry, pp. 23-53. , John Wiley & Sons, NY, S.D.

The flow characteristics of twelve undisturbed soil cores (5. cm in diameter. ×. 6. cm high) were measured in the laboratory after performing X-ray computed microtomography (microCT) analysis. MicroCT 3D imaging was integrated with an existing pore morphologic model and a numerical simulation based on mesh-free smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to calculate the water flow through the macropore network (pores. >. 40. μm). Results showed that the proposed SPH method was able to predict hydraulic conductivity of large-sized samples as falling in the range of the experimental ones. By contrast the morphologic model generally underestimated the water flow and was slightly affected by the pore shape. Increasing microCT imaging resolution and expanding the variability with other soil types will improve the understanding of the role of micropore size and morphology on water conductivity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Pore size distribution; Saturated hydraulic conductivity; Soil structure; X-ray computed microtomography","Andrä, H., Combaret, N., Dvorkin, J., Glatt, E., Han, J., Kabel, M., Keehm, Y., Madonna, C., Digital rock physics benchmarks-part II: computing effective properties (2013) Comput.

The three batches of sparkling waters were clearly differentiated with regard to their bubbles dynamics and losses of dissolved CO<inf>2</inf>. Our observations were systematically rationalized and discussed on the basis of mass transfer considerations including molecular diffusion, basic concepts of gas solution thermodynamic equilibrium, and bubble dynamics. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Batch experiments were performed to investigate the influence of ZVI and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> concentrations on As(III) oxidation and removal. Oxidation and removal kinetics was significantly increased by increasing ZVI concentration or by adding H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in micromolar concentrations slightly higher than that of initial As(III). Observed half-lifes for arsenic removal without added H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> were 81-17min at ZVI concentrations of 0.15-2.5g/L, respectively. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirmed that almost all As(III) was converted to As(V) after 2h of reaction in the pH range 5-9. Addition of 9.6μM H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> to 0.15g/L ZVI suspensions diminished half-lifes for arsenic removal from 81 to 32min and for As(III) oxidation from 77 to 8min, i.e., by approximately a factor of 10. The increased rate of As(III) oxidation is attributable to enhanced formation of oxidants by the Fenton reaction with higher initial concentrations of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>. In practice, results of this study suggest that addition of small amounts (<1mg/L) of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> in various forms (e.g. stable and widely available Na-percarbonate) to water prior to treatment could significantly enhance As(III) oxidation and removal with ZVI. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Arsenic; Hydrogen peroxide; Sodium percarbonate; X-ray absorption spectroscopy; ZVI","Ahmed, M.F., Ahuja, S., Alauddin, M., Hug, S.J., Lloyd, J.R., Pfaff, A., Pichler, T., Van Geen, A., Ensuring safe drinking water in Bangladesh (2006) Science, 314, pp. 1687-1688; Van Geen, A., Bostick, B.C., Thi Kim Trang, P., Lan, V.M., Mai, N.N., Manh, P.D., Viet, P.H., Berg, M., Retardation of arsenic transport through a Pleistocene aquifer (2013) Nature, 501, pp. 204-207; Nordstrom, D.K., Worldwide occurrences of arsenic in ground water (2002) Science, 296; Smedley, P.L., Kinniburgh, D.G., A review of the source, behaviour and distribution of arsenic in natural waters (2002) Appl.

The resulting dominance of DAGs was proven to greatly influence the properties of corresponding fresh or frozen-thawed emulsions. Stable fresh oil-in-water emulsions were produced using either PO-DAG or PO, with stability enhanced by increased concentrations of Na-CN. The lower equilibrium interfacial tension along with greater negative ζ-potential of PO revealed that Na-CN was preferentially adsorbed to the PO interface. Adding 0.05 mol/L NaCl to the PO emulsions minimized depletion flocculation caused by the unadsorbed Na-CN, but further NaCl addition increased oil droplet size and concomitant coalescence. For the PO-DAG emulsions, adding 0.2 mol/L NaCl did not significantly (p > 0.05) affect their ζ-potential but adding 0.05 or 0.1 mol/L NaCl lowered ζ-potential, although NaCl at these concentrations increased oil droplet size and coalescence. Freezing-thawing process considerably weakened the stability of PO-DAG emulsions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We quantified the carbon, water, and ecological footprints of 17,110 family members of Chinese households, covering 1935 types of foods, by combining survey data with available life-cycle assessment data sets. We also summarized the patterns of both food consumption and waste generation and analyzed the factors influencing the observed trends. The average person wasted (consumed) 16 (415) kg of food at home annually, equivalent to 40 (1080) kg CO<inf>2</inf>e, 18 (673) m3, and 173 (4956) gm2 for the carbon, water and ecological footprints, respectively. The generation of food waste was highly correlated with consumption for various food groups. For example, vegetables, rice, and wheat were consumed the most and accounted for the most waste. In addition to the three plant-derived food groups, pork and aquatic products also contributed greatly to embedded footprints. The data obtained in this study could be used for assessing national food security or the carrying capacity of resources. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon footprint; Ecological footprint; Food consumption; Food waste; Household; Water footprint","Buzby, J.C., Hyman, J., Total and per capita value of food loss in the United States (2012) Food Policy, 37 (5), pp. 561-570; New development of data availability, , http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/china, (accessed Feb 2013); Questionnaires for nutrient survey in China Health and Nutrition Survey, , http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/china/data/questionnaires, (accessed Feb 10 2014); Double pyramid 2012: enabling sustainable food choices, , http://www.barillacfn.com/en/position-paper/buono-per-te-sostenibile-per-pianeta-modello-doppia-piramide/, (accessed Dec 2013); The literature database of reviewed LCA studies on foods, , http://www.barillacfn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BCFN_DATABASE_FOR_DOUBLE_PYRAMID_2012.zip, (accessed Dec 2013); Druckman, A., Jackson, T., The carbon footprint of UK households 1990-2004: a socio-economically disaggregated, quasi-multi-regional input-output model (2009) Ecol.

Chia O/W emulsions varying in sodium caseinate (NaCas) concentration (2, 5 and 10% (wt/wt)), with and without 10% (wt/wt) lactose and using different homogenization pressures (400, 600 bar) were prepared, stored at 4 ± 1 °C and analyzed as a function of particle size, ζ-potential, rheological properties, backscattering profiles, peroxide and p-anisidine values. Droplet characteristics, rheology and stability of emulsions are influenced with different extent by the factors analyzed. All systems recorded negatively charged droplets and unimodal particle size distribution. Emulsions with 2 and 5% (wt/wt) NaCas presented a Newtonian fluid behavior. The former showed moderate stability to creaming, while the latter presented destabilization by flocculation and creaming few hours after preparation. Emulsions with 10% (wt/wt) NaCas showed a pseudoplastic fluid behavior and high stability by the rearrangement of the aggregates into a firm gel network.

In catalytic process, the supported Mn<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>/Ti-Al oxide composite catalyst was employed to accelerate the reaction rate. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of temperature, pressure, oxygen excess or dosage of hydrogen peroxide and residence time on the destruction of p-nitrophenol. Appropriate reaction conditions were obtained for both processes. Based on the products generated in reaction, possible reaction pathways were speculated. A possible mechanism was also proposed for the catalytic process according to the experiments focused on the crystal structure transformation in catalyst MnO<inf>2</inf>. The comparison of the two processes indicated that hydrogen peroxide is a better oxidant without its cost taken into consideration, and the reaction rate of catalytic process is much higher than that in non-catalytic process in spite of the better oxidant used in it. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Composite catalyst; P-Nitrophenol; Reaction mechanism; Reaction pathway; Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO)","Bermejo, M., Cantero, F., Cocero, M., Supercritical water oxidation of feeds with high ammonia concentrations: pilot plant experimental results and modeling (2008) Chem.

Three types of emulsifiers, lecithin, Tween-20 and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) were tested. A nonlinear behavior of the antioxidant activity of alkyl gallates when increasing alkyl chain length was observed for emulsions prepared with lecithin. Medium-size alkyl gallates (C6-C12) were the best antioxidants. In contrast, for emulsions prepared with Tween-20, the antioxidants seem to follow the polar paradox. Glucosyl alkyl gallates were shown previously to be better surfactants than alkyl gallates. Nevertheless, they exhibited a worse antioxidant capacity than their corresponding alkyl gallates, in emulsions prepared with lecithin or Tween-20, indicating the greater relevance of having three OH groups at the polar head in comparison with having improved surfactant properties but just a di-ortho phenolic structure in the antioxidant. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Alkyl gallates; Antioxidant; Gallic acid; Glycosylation; Lipid oxidation; Oil-in-water emulsions; Surfactant","Aleman, M., Bou, R., Guardiola, F., Durand, E., Villeneuve, P., Antioxidative effect of lipophilized caffeic acid in fish oil enriched mayonnaise and milk (2015) Food Chemistry, 167, pp. 236-244; Bang, H.O., Dyerberg, J., Nielsen, A.B., Plasma lipid and lipoprotein pattern in Greenlandic West-coast Eskimos (1971) Lancet, 1 (7710), pp. 1143-1145; Chaiyasit, W., McClements, D.J., Decker, E.A., The relationship between the physicochemical properties of antioxidants and their ability to inhibit lipid oxidation in bulk oil and oil-in-water emulsions (2005) Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 53 (12), pp. 4982-4988; Chapman, R.A., Mackay, K., The estimation of peroxides in fats and oils by the ferric thiocyanate method (1949) Journal of the American Oil Chemists Society, 26, pp. 360-363; Dyerberg, J., Bang, H.O., Stoffersen, E., Moncada, S., Vane, J.R., Eicosapentaenoic acid and prevention of thrombosis and atherosclerosis?

Even if the content of viruses in drinking water is very low, it can pose a threat to human health. The photocatalytic membrane reactor (PMR) is a hybrid reactor in which photocatalysis is coupled with a membrane process, and is a promising technology to inactivate viruses and other microorganisms. In this study, the virus removal efficiency and mechanism in an integrated PMR system was evaluated. Bacteriophage f2 (mean size of 25±1nm), which is similar in size to the human enteric virus, was used as the model virus. The influences of filtration flux and permeation mode were tested with a continuous flow. The optimum operating conditions of PMR were determined to be intermittent suction mode with 40L/(m2h) or greater of the filtration flux. PMR removed more than 5 log of phage f2 on average after 24h of continuous operation (f2 in feed tank was 5.22 log). The f2 was primarily inactivated during the photocatalysis process, and the membrane served mainly as a barrier. The mechanism of f2 inactivation during photocatalysis process was investigated. Among the three kinds of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the hydroxyl radicals (OH) was important for the inactivation of f2, which was collected through the reaction of electron vacancy - ""hole"" (h+) and H<inf>2</inf>O. Compared with h+, electron (e-) showed a stronger inactivation effect of f2. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Bacteriophage f2; Membrane; Photocatalysis; PMR; Virus","Zeitler, B., Rapp, I., Surface-dried viruses can resist glucoprotamin-based disinfection (2014) J.

Compared with pure Bi2WO6, the photocatalytic activity of the MWNTs-Bi2WO6 composites was enhanced significantly. The incorporated MWNTs facilitated the photogenerated electron transfer and enhanced the separation of photogenerated hole and electron pairs. In addition, the composite displayed stronger light absorption in the visible light region. Furthermore, the large surface as well as π-π electron coupling with the contaminants of MWNTs promoted the adsorption of TC on the photocatalyst surface. As a result, the incorporation of MWNTs with Bi2WO6 enhanced photocatalytic activity. The best photocatalytic performance was achieved with MWNTs proportion of 3%. Almost 100% of TC (20mg/L) was removed by the solids of 3% MWNTs-Bi2WO6 (0.5g/L) after irradiation with simulated solar light for 60min and the degradation efficiency increased about 35% compared with the bare Bi2WO6. The degradation of the adsorbed TC on the catalyst was also investigated. The FT-IR and DTG analyses demonstrated that the adsorbed TC was slightly degraded in 1h irradiation although the free TC in solution was completely degraded. As the irradiation extended for 3h, the adsorbed TC was also degraded. The results indicated that the prepared MWNTs-Bi2WO6 composite has great potential for treatment of organic pollutants in water. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Multiwalled carbon; Photocatalysis","Ghadim, E.E., Manouchehri, F., Soleimani, G., Hosseini, H., Kimiagar, S., Nafisi, S., (2013) PLoS One, 8; Ling, A.L., Pace, N.R., Hernandez, M.T., LaPara, T.M., (2013) Environ.

In this experiment, the relative importance of biological and physiochemical mechanisms that aid in the reclamation of physical and chemical properties of a saline-sodic soil amended with composts and biochar were evaluated. Unsterilized and pre-sterilized soil and amendment mixtures were used to test the effects of biological and physiochemical factors. Soil and organic amendments were initially subjected to sterilization by autoclaving and gamma irradiation before incubation. Amendments were applied at a rate of 75tha-1 and treated soils were incubated for a month and then leached with reclaimed water. Soil physical and chemical characteristics such as wet aggregate stability, hydraulic conductivity, cumulative Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ leached, soil pH, SAR, EC<inf>e</inf>, and ESP were analyzed. Results indicate that pre-sterilization significantly affected soil physical properties such as aggregate stability and hydraulic conductivity only in compost-treated soils. Unsterilized compost-treated soils had significantly higher soil aggregate stability and saturated hydraulic conductivity than pre-sterilized soils. Soil pH was significantly lower in unsterilized soils that received composts, but other chemical properties were not affected by pre-sterilization. No significant effect of initial sterilization was observed in biochar treated soils in remediating their physical and chemical properties. Irrespective of sterilization, composts and biochar successfully remediated a saline-sodic soil leached with reclaimed water. It appears that the mode of action of biochar is physiochemical while composts provide a comprehensive reclamation when biological and physiochemical factors act together. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Biochar; Compost; Leaching; Saline-sodic soil; Soil reclamation; Sterilization","Abiven, S., Menasseri, S., Angers, D.A., Leterme, P., Dynamics of aggregate stability and biological binding agents during decomposition of organic materials (2007) Eur.

The as-synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The photocatalytic activities of as-synthesized samples were tested by the oxidation of methyl orange (MO), rhodamine B (RhB), methylene blue (MB) and the reduction of aqueous Cr(VI) under visible-light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation, and compared with N-dope P25 (N-P25) and the undoped TiO<inf>2</inf>. Besides, the effects of the coexistence of MO, RhB, and MB on FeNS-TiO<inf>2</inf>-mediated photocatalytic reduction of aqueous Cr(VI) were also studied. The results indicated FeNS-TiO<inf>2</inf> displayed higher visible-light-activated photocatalytic activity than N-P25 and the undoped TiO<inf>2</inf>. Otherwise, FeNS-TiO<inf>2</inf> showed the coexistence of MB enhanced the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI), whereas the coexistence of MO and RhB retarded the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) over FeNS-TiO<inf>2</inf>. Moreover, a possible photocatalytic mechanism is discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","A. Oxides; A. Semiconductors; B. Solvothermal; D.

Results showed that solubilization enhancement of TCS by rhamnolipid was higher in acid pH range than in alkaline pH range and was the highest at the ionic strength of 5×10-2M. Sorption of rhamnolipid onto sediment decreased with the increase of pH while the result was contrary to ionic strength. Moreover, the apparent distribution coefficients of TCS (K*<inf>d</inf>) decreased from 73.35 to 32.30 L/kg with an increase of solution pH, as varying pH had significant influence on sorption of RL onto sediment and degree of ionization of TCS. Rhamnolipid presented the largest distribution capacity of TCS into the aqueous phase at moderate ionic strength (5×10-2M) with the K*<inf>d</inf> of 17.26 L/kg. Further results also indicated that the presence of humic acid in aqueous phase could increase the desorption of TCS from contaminated sediment. The desorption enhancement was much higher in the system containing both rhamnolipid and DOM than in the single system. These findings provide meaningful information for enhanced migration of TCS from sediment to water by rhamnolipid. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Desorption; Rhamnolipid; Sediment; Sorption; Triclosan","Bedoux, G., Roig, B., Thomas, O., Dupont, V., Le Bot, B., Occurrence and toxicity of antimicrobial triclosan and by-products in the environment (2012) Environ.

The critical Rayleigh numbers for the onset of convection at different density inversion parameters were determined, and the stability ranges of all flow patterns were assured by increasing or decreasing the Rayleigh number. The heat transfer rates at different flow patterns were measured by the average Nusselt number on the hot wall. The results indicated that the critical Rayleigh number for the onset of the convection increases, the number of the flow patterns decreases and the transition between the flow patterns becomes simple with the increase of the density inversion parameter. There are some new flow patterns of Rayleigh-Bénard convection of cold water, which do not appear for that of the common fluids. The flow patterns depend on not only the Rayleigh number and the density inversion parameter, but also the initial condition and the flow history. Furthermore, there is a hysteresis phenomenon during the transition of the flow pattern. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This solid pyrite used as heterogeneous catalyst instead of a soluble iron salt, is the catalyst the system needs for production of hydroxyl radicals. Experiments were performed in an undivided cell equipped with a BDD anode and a commercial carbon felt cathode to electrogenerate in situ H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and regenerate ferrous ions as catalyst. The effects on operating parameters, such as applied current, pyrite concentration and initial dye content, were investigated. AHPS decay and mineralization efficiencies were monitored by HPLC analyses and TOC measurements, respectively. Experimental results showed that AHPS was quickly oxidized by hydroxyl radicals (OH) produced simultaneously both on BDD surface by water discharge and in solution bulk from electrochemically assisted Fenton's reaction with a pseudo-first-order reaction. AHPS solutions with 175mgL-1 (100mgL-1 initial TOC) content were then almost completely mineralized in 8h. Moreover, the results demonstrated that, under the same conditions, AHPS degradation by pyrite electro-Fenton process was more powerful than the conventional electro-Fenton process. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","AHPS; BDD anode; Heterogeneous catalyst; Hydroxyl radical; Mineralization; Pyrite electro-Fenton","Villanueva-Rodríguez, M., Hernández-Ramírez, A., Peralta-Hernández, J.M., Bandala, E.R., Quiroz-Alfaro, M.A., Enhancing the electrochemical oxidation of acid-yellow 36 azo dye using boron-doped diamond electrodes by addition of ferrous ion (2009) J.

The microstructure, composition and morphology of MG-RGO composites are systematically characterized by UV-vis absorption, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrochemical performances are investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The fast redox reactions from MG could generate additional pseudocapacitance, which endows RGO higher capacitances. As a result, the MG-RGO composite (with the 5:4 mass ratio of MG:RGO) achieve a maximum value of 341 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 within the potential range from -0.25 to 0.75 V and provide a 180% enhancement in specific capacitance in comparison with pure RGO. Furthermore, excellent rate capability (72% capacitance retention from 1 A g-1 to 20 A g-1) and long life cycle (12% capacitance decay after 5000 cycles) are achieved for the MG-RGO composite electrode. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Exposure experiments monitoring the size evolution of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) coated AgNPs in organic solutions confirm the capacity of SDBS, NAC and EDTA to partly displace PVP. Single Pulse Column Experiment (SPCE) results show both the PVP polymer and the silver core controlled AgNP deposition while the effect of the PVP was dominant. Results of Co-injected Pulse Column Experiments (CPCEs) where AgNP and SDBS or NAC were co-injected into the column following a very short mixing (<. 1. s) disprove our hypothesis that coating-alternation by particle associated organic would mobilize irreversibly deposited particles from the uncoated sand, while surface charge modification by adsorbed NAC was identified as a potential mobilizing mechanism for AgNP from the iron-oxide-coated sand. Triple Pulse Column Experiment (TPCE) results confirm that such a charging effect of the adsorbed organic molecules may enable SDBS and NAC to mobilize AgNPs from the iron-oxide-coated sands. TPCE results with five distinct levels of SDBS indicate that concentration-stimulated change in the SDBS format from an individual to a micelle significantly increased the mobilizing efficiency and site blockage of SDBS. Although being an electrolyte, EDTA did not mobilize AgNPs, as the case with SDBS or NAC, as it dissolved the iron oxides which in turn prevented EDTA adsorption on sand. The findings have implications for better understanding the behavior of polymer-coated nanoparticles in organic-presented groundwater systems, i.e., detachment-associated uncertainty in exposure prediction of the nanomaterials. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Chelate; Organic sulfide; Organic-induced mobilization; Polymer-coated AgNP; Porous media","Akaighe, N., Depner, S.W., Banerjee, S., Sohn, M., Transport and deposition of Suwannee River Humic Acid/natural organic matter formed silver nanoparticles on silica matrices: the influence of solution pH and ionic strength (2013) Chemosphere, 92, pp. 406-412; Bell, R.A., Kramer, J.R., Structural chemistry and geochemistry of silver-sulfur compounds: critical review (1999) Environ.

The adsorption of Cs+ by FPPB follows the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm model with distribution coefficients touched 1.15×105mL/g and a good adsorption capacity of 72.47mg/g (pH≈7). FPPB displays high adsorption capacity for Cs+ capture under a wide pH range (4.0-10). The kinetics of Cs+ uptake by FPPB is fast (>90% elimination capacity of relatively low Cs+ concentrations during only 20min of Cs+/FPPB contact) and fit well with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. This should be attributed to the high dispersion of PB nanoparticles. The adsorption Cs+ from complex solutions containing various competitive cations in large excess was also effective. FPPB is a cost-effective sorbent and could be developed by only stirring using environmental friendly and inexpensive materials at room temperature. Furthermore, the FPPB-Cs+ can be easily retrieved from water with sieve. It is expected that the as-prepared FPPB has extensive applicability in the elimination of radiocesium from nuclear wastewater. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Fe3+ crosslinking PAA resin; Nuclear pollution; Prussian blue nanocomposite; Radiocesium","http://www.epa.gov/rpdweb00/radionuclides%20/index.html, Radiation Protection, U.

Moisture content, water vapor barrier properties, water sorption isotherms and mechanical properties were evaluated. Crust model showed multilayer internal structure. Glycerol (10% and 20%) and HPMC-10% increased moisture content, whereas linolenic acid and beeswax, glycerol-1%, HPMC-0.5% and citric acid significantly decreased it. Water vapor permeability (WVP) decreased with lipids and citric acid, due to their hydrophobic nature and crosslinking action, respectively. Hydrophobic additives lowered the WVP of the crust and provided water barrier properties and brittle texture. Crust mechanical properties were greatly correlated with water present as well as with composition of crust layer. Barrier properties of the crust layer were greatly dependent on the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the additives, which determined the internal interactions between starch and proteins and the microstructure and mechanical properties. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Ultrafiltration (UF) membranes and nonionic resins were applied to fractionate THMs precursor into various molecular weight (MW) fractions and hydrophobic/hydrophilic fractions. Characteristics of coagulated water and adsorbed water were evaluated by the three-dimensional excitation and emission matrix (3DEEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. Results showed that coagulation and adsorption were suitable for removing different hydrophobic/hydrophilic and fluorescent fractions. Coagulation decreased THMs concentration in hydrophobic acids (HoA) fraction from 59 μg/L to 39 μg/L, while the lowest THMs concentration (9 μg/L) in hydrophilic substances (HiS) fraction was obtained in adsorbed water. However, both coagulation and adsorption were ineffective for removing fractions with MW. < 5 kDa. Although coagulation and adsorption processes could reduce THMs formation, some specific THMs formation potential (STHMFP) in residual dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions increased in this study. Hydrophobic acid and hydrophilic fractions increased after coagulation treatment, and low MW and hydrophobic fractions increased after adsorption treatment. In addition, active carbon adsorbed more organic matter than coagulant, but brominated disinfection byproducts (Br-DBPs) in adsorbed water turned to the major THMs species after chlorination. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Bio-treated municipal wastewater; Fluorescence; Hydrophobicity; Molecular weight; Trihalomethanes","Yang, X., Guo, W., Lee, W., Formation of disinfection byproducts upon chlorine dioxide preoxidation followed by chlorination or chloramination of natural organic matter (2013) Chemosphere, 91, pp. 1477-1485; Fantuzzi, G., Righi, E., Predieri, G., Ceppelli, G., Gobba, F., Aggazzotti, G., Occupational exposure to trihalomethanes in indoor swimming pools (2001) Sci.

In this work, we characterize the mechanical properties of a fiber metal laminate, where an outermost steel layer is utilized as protection against contamination. In particular, we perform experiments on wearing resistance, static strength characterization, moisture absorption, low-velocity impact behavior, dynamic behavior, and dynamic thermal analysis. Experiments are conducted on specimens conditioned in hot water and findings are compared against results obtained with dry specimens that underwent the same thermal cycles, but without being in contact with water. Results show that the water absorption in unprotected specimens decreases all the mechanical properties of the laminate. Instead, the outer protective metal layer is found to be very effective against water absorption, whereby results on the conditioned protected specimens are in line with the ones obtained for the dry specimens. Further, the protective steel layer is found to remarkably increase the wearing resistance. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Ageing; Dynamic properties; Fiber metal laminate; Low-velocity impact; Water absorption","Zweben, C., Advanced composites for aerospace applications (1981) Composites, 12 (4), pp. 235-240;

Fertilization rates were high (up to 314kgNha-1year-1) and resulted in simulated direct N<inf>2</inf>O emissions from potato, radish, soybean and cabbage fields of 1.9 and 2.1kgNha-1year-1 in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Nitrate leaching was identified as the dominant pathway of N losses in the Haean catchment with mean annual rates of 112.2 and 125.4kgNha-1year-1, causing threats to water quality and leading to substantial indirect N<inf>2</inf>O emissions of 0.84 and 0.94kgNha-1year-1 in 2009 and 2010 as estimates by applying the IPCC EF<inf>5</inf>. Simulated N<inf>2</inf>O emissions from temperate deciduous forest were low (approx. 0.50kgNha-1year-1) and predicted nitrate leaching rates were even negligible (≤0.01kgNha-1year-1). On catchment scale more than 50% of the total N<inf>2</inf>O emissions and up to 75% of nitrate leaching originated from fertilized upland fields, only covering 24% of the catchment area. Taking into account area coverage of simulated upland crops and other land uses these numbers agree well with nitrate loads calculated from discharge and concentration measurements at the catchment outlet. The change of current agricultural management practices showed a high potential of reducing N<inf>2</inf>O emission and nitrate leaching while maintaining current crop yields. Reducing (39%) and splitting N fertilizer application into 3 times was most effective and lead to about 54% and 77% reducing of N<inf>2</inf>O emission and nitrate leaching from the Haean catchment, the latter potentially contributing to improved water quality in the Soyang River Dam, which is the major source of drinking water for metropolitan residents. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","LandscapeDNDC; Mitigation strategies; N<inf>2</inf>O; Nitrate leaching; Water quality","Abdalla, M., Jones, M., Yeluripati, J., Smith, P., Burke, J., Williams, M., Testing DayCent and DNDC model simulations of N<inf>2</inf>O fluxes and assessing the impacts of climate change on the gas flux and biomass production from a humid pasture (2010) Atmos.

These compounds are known to interfere with the delicate balance of the endocrine system of animals and man, causing variety of undesirable outcomes. Their sources in natural waters are the domestic and industrial effluents. The main cause of concern with EDCs is their tendency to accumulate in fish causing gender shifts and reduced fecundity. Moreover, their possible interference with the water cycle and concurrent effects on the human endocrine system has been implicated. Increased usage of medication and surfactants in the household; pesticides in agriculture have all add up to the inventory of EDCs in the aqueous systems.Current view in combating EDCs in water cycle is the multi barrier approach. In this concept EDCs are tried to be controlled in effluents as well as in potable drinking waters. Therefore, knowledge on their elimination in classical wastewater treatment plants is vital for establishing sustainable strategies for the future.Five different EDCs were selected as model compounds in this study; two natural hormones, estrone and progesterone, which are constantly discharged by humans; carbamazepine, diltiazem and acetaminophen are pharmaceuticals which are widely used by the community. The 24. h composite samples were analyzed in influents and effluents of 7 full scale biological treatment plants of various modifications of activated sludge process, including one MBR plant. One striking finding was the removals obtained in conventional plants, which were far exceeding those obtained in the mid-scale or lab-scale MBR plants. Carbamazepine and diltiazem, two hydrophobic compounds, were found to sorb onto CAS sludge whereas not onto the MBR sludge. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Conventional treatment; EDC treatment; Emerging pollutants; Endocrine disrupting compounds","Kavlock, R.J., Daston, G.P., DeRosa, C., Research needs for the risk assessment of health and environmental effects of endocrine disruptors: a report of the US EPA-sponsored workshop (1996) Environ.

It is one of the most important viable applications of solar energy. The simplest and most proven type of solar stills is the single basin type, but its thermal performance is limited. Many research papers were presented where different methods were performed to improve the productivity of single basin solar stills. In this paper, a review of different designs of solar stills was presented particularly the double, triple and multi-effect solar stills, vertical stills, tubular type solar stills, finned and corrugated stills, and stepped type solar stills. A detailed cost analysis for different configurations was presented. The various parameters affecting the performance of the considered designs of solar stills were outlined. The daily productivity of the double basin solar still is on the average 36% higher than that of the single basin still. The inverted absorber triple basin solar still gives a substantially higher yield than double and single basin inverted absorber solar stills. An optimum area of the vertical still absorber was found to be 3.5 m2. From the results obtained for the tubular solar still it was concluded that with cooling air flow, the production increased by about 32.8%, and with cooling water flow, it further increased by about 59% more than the system without cooling. A maximum increase in productivity of about 98% was achieved for stepped solar stills when fins, sponge and pebbles were used. The maximum productivity of stepped solar still was obtained with tray depth and width of 5 and 120 mm, which is about 57.3% higher than that of the conventional still. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Finned type solar stills;

During the heating process, the inner surface is under complex convection heat transfer condition, which is not so easy to approximate. This paper first calculated the gas temperature history and the convective heat transfer coefficient history between the gas flow and the inner surface and then they were applied to the inner surface as boundary conditions. Finite element analysis was used to solve the transient heat transfer equations of the hollow cylinder. Results show that the inner surface is under strong thermal impact and large temperature gradient occurs in the region adjacent to the inner surface. Sometimes chromium plating and water cooling are used to relief the thermal shock of a tube under such thermal conditions. The effects of these methods are analyzed, and it indicates that the chromium plating can reduce the maximum temperature of the inner surface for the first cycle during periodic heating and the water cooling method can reduce the growth trend of the maximum temperature for sustained conditions. We also investigate the effects of different parameters on the maximum temperature of the inner surface, like chromium thickness, water velocity, channel diameter, and number of cooling channels.

Water tank volumes representing 100% efficiency (V<inf>r</inf>) were calculated by the Ripple method with different results depending on two consumption scenarios adopted for irrigation. The RHS design was based on a precipitation record spanning a rather long period (3 decades). The calculated storage capacities fulfilled the water demand even when prolonged droughts occurred during that timeframe. However, because the drought events have been rather scarce the V<inf>r</inf> values were considered oversized and replaced by optimal volumes. Notwithstanding the new volumes were solely half of the original V<inf>r</inf> values, the projected RHS efficiency remained very high (around 90%) while the probability of system failure (efficiency < 100%) stayed very low (in the order of 5%). In both scenarios, the economic savings related to the optimization of V<inf>r</inf> were noteworthy, while the investment's return periods decreased substantially from the original to the optimized solutions. A high efficiency with a low storage capacity is typical of low demanding applications of rainwater harvesting, where water availability (V<inf>w</inf>) largely exceeds water demand (C<inf>w</inf>), that is to say where demand fractions (C<inf>w</inf>/. V<inf>w</inf>) are very low. Based on the results of a literature review covering an ample geographic distribution and describing a very large number of demand fraction scenarios, a C<inf>w</inf>/. V<inf>w</inf>=. 0.8 was defined as the threshold to generally distinguish the low from the high demanding RHS applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Demand fraction; Low demanding application; Probability of RHS failure; Rainwater harvesting system; RHS efficiency","Abdulla, F.A., Al-Shareef, A.W., Roof rainwater harvesting systems for household water supply in Jordan (2009) Desalination, 243, pp. 195-207; Agarwal, A., Narain, S., Dying wisdom: rise, fall and potential of India's traditional water harvesting systems (2005) State of India's Environment, A Citizens' Report 4, p. 404. , Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi; Annecchini, K.P.V., (2005) Aproveitamento da água da chuva para fins não potáveis na cidade de Vitória (ES), , (MSc thesis), Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo, Brazil, (in Portuguese); (2009) ETA 0701 - Sistemas de Abastecimento de Águas Pluviais em Edifícios (SAAP), Version 7, , Portuguese National Association for Quality in Building Services - ANQIP, Lisbon, Portugal, (in Portuguese); Barron, J., Introduction: rainwater harvesting as a way to support ecosystem services and human well-being (2009) Rainwater Harvesting: A Lifeline for Human Well-being (Chapter 1), pp. 1-3. , Stockholm Environment Institute, York, UK/Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm, Sweden, J.

Ibuprofen is a NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and is now an emerging contaminant of the aquatic environment. The effect of IBP concentration, pH and temperature on the equilibrium adsorption capacity is investigated through batch tests. The experimental results show that the highest adsorption capacity is observed under acidic pH and high temperature conditions. The combined effect of pH and temperature on IBP dissociation in water seems to play a major role in determining the IBP adsorption capacity of the activated carbon. Low pH and high temperature, in fact, reduce the IBP dissociation grade and increase the concentration of the non-ionized IBP species, which is likely to have a higher adsorption capacity with respect to the ionized one. The study puts forward a model to describe the IBP adsorption mechanism considering the variability of the dissociation grade. The model is based on the multicomponent Langmuir adsorption theory applied to the ionic species in solution. It shows that the adsorption capacity is strictly dependent on the IBP speciation in solution, allowing for a correct interpretation of the effects pH and temperature on IBP adsorption capacity. Finally, one of the main goals of this model is to preserve the exothermicity of the adsorption phenomena despite the trend observed in the experimental results: the increase in adsorption capacity with temperature appears to be related to a lower level of IBP dissociation. © 2015.","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Ibuprofen; Langmuir model; Pharmaceuticals; Water treatment","Halling-Sørensen, B., Nors Nielsen, N., Lansky, P.F., Ingerslev, F., Hansen, L., Holten Lützhøft, H.C., Jørgensen, S.E., Occurrence, fate and effects of pharmaceutical substances in the environment-a review (1998) Chemosphere, 36, pp. 357-394; Ziylan, A., Ince, N.H., The occurrence and fate of anti-inflammatory and analgesic pharmaceuticals in sewage and fresh water: treatability by conventional and non-conventional processes (2011) J.

Fatigue tests in zero-to-tension loading were carried out (i) in air, (ii) in crude oil, (iii) in a mixture of crude oil with rainwater, and (iv) in water separated from the crude oil phase. The aim of the investigation was to assess the degree of degradation of the fatigue properties of this steel due to the action of environments typical for crude oil processing and transport. The results are not directly comparable to any corrosion fatigue experienced by the crude oil pipeline, since the strain rate for the tests was higher by an order of five than the strain rate observed in typical loading cycles. The results showed that crude oil and a mixture of crude oil with rainwater had no aggressive effect on the steel in the sense of reducing its fatigue characteristics, while the separated water had an aggressive effect.

The main objective of this study was to analyze the mineralization reactions that occurred during the studied operating conditions. Solution TOC removal was nearly complete (99%) within 90min, which prevented the accumulation of toxic intermediates. The mineralization process of carbamazepine solutions can be described using pseudo-second-order kinetics. Under acidic conditions, Fe2+ can exhibit catalytic effects on H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> decomposition and persulfate activation. With excess persulfate, an unproductive S<inf>2</inf>O<inf>8</inf>2- decomposition reaction (with no generation of SO<inf>4</inf>-) or a rapid reaction between excess sulfate radicals to produce sulfate anions could occur. Sulfate and hydroxyl radicals were involved in the main mineralization pathway. The influences of chloride ions on mineralization were also evaluated. The results demonstrated that this activated persulfate-based oxidation system could be used to control water pollution by emerging contaminants, such as carbamazepine. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Carbamazepine; Chloride; Persulfate; TOC; Ultrasound","Kim, S.D., Cho, J., Kim, I.S., Vanderford, B.J., Snyder, S.A., (2007) Water Res., 41, pp. 1013-1021; Roberts, P.H., Thomas, K.V., (2006) Sci.

Microchannels are patterned on the SS plate and fabricated to make a vaporizer unit. The reformer is in the form of two SS plates placed one above the other. The water-methanol mixture enters from the top cover plate and gets vaporised in the channels cut on the vaporiser plate. The mixture then flows through the reformer plates on which the cavities are engraved to enhance mixing of water-methanol vapors. The catalyst is deposited on the fins of the reformer plates using a new promising technique for depositing nanostructured films namely, Solution Precursor Plasma Spray (SPPS) technique. The performance of the microreformer unit is investigated at various operating conditions of inlet feed flow rate, molar ratio of water to methanol and reforming temperature. The developed microreformer unit is able to generate enough hydrogen to produce a power output of 27. W. The proposed design can also overcome the issue of shape and size of manifolds and ensure equi-flow distribution for multiple microchannel type microreformer designs and appears simple and suitable from fabrication viewpoint. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Hydrogen production; Methanol reformation; Plate type microreformer; Solution precursor plasma spray (SPPS)","Kreuer, K.D., (2001) J.

Fresh salmon was subjected to a smoking process in the WP at 5°C. Physicochemical and microbiological analyses were periodically carried out during the subsequent 40 days of refrigerated storage of the product. The WP bags enabled the evaporation of the exudate during the smoking-salting stage, enabling the drying of the product to take place at the same time. A slight increase of trimethylamine nitrogen (TMA-N) and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) contents was observed over the storage period. The concentration of TVB-N ranged from 14.26 to 21.48mgN/100g of fish, values far below the upper limits of acceptability. The low values of the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) index (final level of 0.71mg MDA/kg) indicate that the lipid oxidation in the smoke-flavoured salmon was limited throughout the period studied. The initial K<inf>1</inf>-value was high and only a slight increase was observed during storage. Counts of mesophilic, psychrotrophic, Enterobacteriaceae and lactic acid bacteria were low throughout the study. Given the changes observed for the physicochemical and microbiological parameters, it can be said that no spoilage took place in the smoke-flavoured salmon during the 40 days of storage. This new method could be of interest to producers as it enables smoke-flavoured salmon to be produced to a good standard of hygiene, minimizing handling and reducing processing steps and brine wastes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Quality changes; Smoke-flavoured salmon; Storage; Water vapour permeable bags","Ahnström, M.L., Seyfert, M., Hunt, M.C., Johnson, D.E., Dry aging of beef in a bag highly permeable to water vapour (2006) Meat Science, 73 (4), pp. 674-679; (1997) Official methods of analysis, , Association of Official Analytical Chemists, Washington; Arashisar, S., Hisar, O., Kaya, M., Yanik, T., Effects of modified atmosphere and vacuum packaging on microbiological and chemical properties of rainbow trout (Oncorynchus mykiss) fillets (2004) International Journal of Food Microbiology, 97, pp. 209-214; Barat, J.M., Gil, L., García-Breijo, E., Aristoy, M.C., Toldrá, F., Martínez-Máñez, R., Freshness monitoring of sea bream (Sparus aurata) with a potentiometric sensor (2008) Food Chemistry, 108 (2), pp. 681-688; Bugueño, G., Escriche, I., Martínez-Navarrete, N., Camacho, M.M., Chiralt, A., Influence of storage conditions on some physical and chemical properties of smoked salmon (Salmo salar) processed by vacuum impregnation techniques (2003) Food Chemistry, 81, pp. 85-90; Burns, B.G., Kee, P.J., Liquid chromatographic determination of hypoxanthine content in fish tissue (1985) Journal of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 68, pp. 444-448; Cardinal, M., Gunnlaugsdottir, H., Bjoernevik, M., Ouisse, A., Luc Vallet, J., Leroi, F., Sensory characteristics of cold-smoked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from European market and relationships with chemical, physical and microbiological measurements (2004) Food Research International, 37 (2), pp. 181-193; (2013) Standard for smoked fish, smoke-flavoured fish and smoke-dried fish, , (311-2013); Connell, J.J., (1995) Control of fish quality, , Fishing News Books Limited, Oxford; Dalgaard, P., (2000) Freshness, quality and safety in seafood, , http://flairflow4.vscht.cz/seafood00.pdf, Flair-Flow Europe Technical Manual F-FE 380A/00.

To determinate the turbidity quantitatively, the total intensity of scattering light has been measured and quantified as number of photons by adopting the single photon detection techniques (SPDT) which has the advantage of high sensitivity. On the basis of SPDT, the measurement system has been built and series of experiments have been carried out. Combining then the 90° Mie scattering theory with the principle of SPDT, a turbidity measurement model has been proposed to explain the experimental results. The experimental results show that a turbidity, which is as low as 0.1 NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units), can be measured steadily within 100 ms. It also shows a good linearity and stability over the range of 0.1-400 NTU and the precision can be controlled within 5% full scale. In order to improve its precision and stability, some key parameters, including the sampling time and incident light intensity, have been discussed. It has been proved that, to guarantee an excellent system performance, a good compromise between the measurement speed and the low power consumption should be considered adequately depending on the practical applications. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
