In the embedded surveillance system, where memory and computing resources are limited, simple and efficient computer vision algorithms are required. In this letter, we present a moving object detection method for real-time traffic surveillance applications. The proposed method is a combination of a genetic dynamic saliency map (GDSM), which is an improved version of dynamic saliency map (DSM) and background subtraction.

In this paper, we put forward a novel unsupervised learning framework for anomaly detection. At feature level, we propose a Sparse Semi-nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SSMF) to learn local patterns at each pixel, and a Histogram of Nonnegative Coefficients (HNC) can be constructed as local feature which is more expressive than previously used features like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). At model level, we learn a probability model which takes the spatial and temporal contextual information into consideration. Our framework is totally unsupervised requiring no human-labeled training data. With more expressive features and more complicated model, our framework can accurately detect and localize anomalies in surveillance video. We carried out extensive experiments on several benchmark video datasets for anomaly detection, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our framework to state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of our framework. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Adam, A., Rivlin, E., Shimshoni, I., Reinitz, D., Robust real-time unusual event detection using multiple fixed-location monitors (2008) IEEE Trans.

The use of the social network as an extra vector of attack to penetrate the security measures in IP networks is improving the effectiveness of malware, and have therefore been used by the most aggressive viruses, like Conficker and Stuxnet. In this work we use interdependent networks to model the propagation of these kind of viruses. In particular, we study the propagation of a SIS model on interdependent networks where the state of each node is layer-independent and the dynamics in each network follows either a contact process or a reactive process, with different propagation rates. We apply this study to the case of existing interdependent networks, namely a Spanish scientific community of Statistical Physics, formed by a social network of scientific collaborations and a physical network of connected computers in each institution. We show that the interplay between layers increases dramatically the infectivity of viruses in the long term and their robustness against immunization. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Contagion spreading; Interdependent networks; Markov processes; Multiplex networks; Networks; Percolation","Anderson, R., Measuring the cost of cybercrime (2012) Paper in 11th Annual Workshop on the Economics of Information Security; Porras, P., Saidi, H., Yegneswaran, V., (2009) Conficker C Analysis.

Integration of wind farms and solar systems as the major IRESs have significantly boosted the level of uncertainty in operation of power systems. This paper proposes a comprehensive computational framework for quantification and integration of uncertainties in distributed power systems (DPSs) with IRESs. Different sources of uncertainties in DPSs such as electrical load, wind and solar power forecasts and generator outages are covered by the proposed framework. Load forecast uncertainty is assumed to follow a normal distribution. Wind and solar forecast are implemented by a list of prediction intervals (PIs) ranging from 5% to 95%. Their uncertainties are further represented as scenarios using a scenario generation method. Generator outage uncertainty is modeled as discrete scenarios. The integrated uncertainties are further incorporated into a stochastic security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem and a heuristic genetic algorithm is utilized to solve this stochastic SCUC problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, five deterministic and four stochastic case studies are implemented. Generation costs as well as different reserve strategies are discussed from the perspectives of system economics and reliability. Comparative results indicate that the planned generation costs and reserves are different from the realized ones. The stochastic models show better robustness than deterministic ones. Power systems run a higher level of risk during peak load hours. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Genetic algorithm; Prediction interval; Renewable energy; Scenario generation; Uncertainty integration; Unit commitment","Amjady, N., Keynia, F., Zareipour, H., Wind power prediction by a new forecast engine composed of modified hybrid neural network and enhanced particle swarm optimization (2011) IEEE Trans Sustain Energy, 2 (3), pp. 265-276;

This paper illustrates an approach to attack detection that analyzes just the standard statistics automatically generated by the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) through unsupervised distributed data mining algorithms. We describe the design of a decentralized system composed of a peer-to-peer network of monitoring stations: each of them continuously gathers SNMP statistical observations about the network traffic and runs a distributed data clustering algorithm in cooperation with other stations. This progressively leads to the construction of a traffic model capable to detect undergoing attacks on later observations, including potentially previously unknown attacks. To estimate the accuracy of the described system, we performed an extensive number of distributed data clustering processing on data sets of SNMP observations generated from real traffic. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Data clustering; Data mining; Network security; NIDS; Peer-to-peer; SNMP","Bradley, P., Fayyad, U., Refining initial points for K-means clustering (1998) Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Machine Learning, 66, pp. 91-99. , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc; Cabrera, J.B.D., Lewis, L., Qin, X., Lee, W., Prasanth, R., Ravichandran, B., Proactive detection of distributed denial of service attacks using MIB traffic variables-a feasibility study (2001) Integrated Network Management Proceedings, 2001 IEEE/IFIP International Symposium on, pp. 609-622; Case, J., Fedor, M., Schoffstall, M., Davin, J., (1990) Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), , http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1157.txt, RFC 1157 (Historic) URL; Cerroni, W., Monti, G., Moro, G., Ramilli, M., Network attack detection based on peer-to-peer clustering of SNMP data (2009) Lecture Notes of ICST Springer, 22, pp. 417-430. , Quality of service in heterogeneous networks; Cerroni, W., Moro, G., Pirini, T., Ramilli, M., Peer-to-peer data mining classifiers for decentralized detection of network attacks (2013) CRPIT, 137, pp. 101-108. , http://crpit.com/Vol137.html, Database technologies 2013 (ADC 2013) of Australian computer society, Adelaide, Australia H.

This becomes a key factor for imaging rapidly occurring events in the cellular environment. To facilitate real-time imaging, we have developed a graphics processing unit (GPU) based real-time maximum a-posteriori (MAP) image reconstruction system. The parallel processing capability of GPU device that consists of a large number of tiny processing cores and the adaptability of image reconstruction algorithm to parallel processing (that employ multiple independent computing modules called threads) results in high temporal resolution. Moreover, the proposed quadratic potential based MAP algorithm effectively deconvolves the images as well as suppresses the noise. The multi-node multi-threaded GPU and the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) efficiently execute the iterative image reconstruction algorithm that is ≈200-fold faster (for large dataset) when compared to existing CPU based systems. © 2015 Author(s).",,"Hell, S.W., Wichmann, J., (1994) Opt.

The history of risk evaluation is moving from the point of accident investigation toward prior determination of quantum risk level. The risk level assessment is a part of risk evaluation process for identifying the risk aspects, impacts, hazard significance, and operational hazards. Risk assessment process helps for appropriate design of risk control procedures, to suggest provision of safety adequacy measures to reduce risk consequences, avoid or mitigate risks, and hazards. Risk free and failure free or fail-safe Operations in Safety-Critical Systems may not lead to loss of equipment, financial loss, environmental damage and hazard to human life. Prevailing standard techniques point out various risk factors and map out potential points where a safety critical operation can fail. The development of a framework is based on prevailing applicable standards and deals with safety-risk assessment for safety automation of safety-critical system operations. To explore various underlying risk factors, impacts and evaluation for determining risk magnitude, attributes and probabilities exhaustively considering practical conditions, a framework for safety automation of safety-critical operations is proposed. The methodology identifies underlying risk factors and determines risk significance for occupational and financial. Based on the identifications, a ten point scale to assess safety-risks is derived. The results of framework application to power plant case showed substantial improvement in assessing risks when compared to existing risk assessments. This is an indication of prevailing limited/inadequate safety-risk assessment in deeply addressing associated operational risks, proving the framework useful. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Functional safety; Power plant operations; Safety-critical systems; Software quality; Software safety","Alberico, D., Bozarth, J., Brown, M., JSSC Software System Safety Handbook (1999), A Technical and Managerial Team Approach (December)Antonsen, S., The relationship between culture and safety on offshore supply vessels (2009) Saf.

The Steered Response Power with Phase Transform (SRP-PHAT) algorithm is a well-known approach for sound source localization due to its robust performance in noisy and reverberant environments. This algorithm analyzes the sound power captured by an acoustic beamformer on a defined spatial grid, estimating the source location as the point that maximizes the output power. Since localization accuracy can be improved by using high-resolution spatial grids and a high number of microphones, accurate acoustic localization systems require high computational power. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are highly parallel programmable co-processors that provide massive computation when the needed operations are properly parallelized. Emerging GPUs offer multiple parallelism levels; however, properly managing their computational resources becomes a very challenging task. In fact, management issues become even more difficult when multiple GPUs are involved, adding one more level of parallelism. In this paper, the performance of an acoustic source localization system using distributed microphones is analyzed over a massive multichannel processing framework in a multi-GPU system. The paper evaluates and points out the influence that the number of microphones and the available computational resources have in the overall system performance. Several acoustic environments are considered to show the impact that noise and reverberation have in the localization accuracy and how the use of massive microphone systems combined with parallelized GPU algorithms can help to mitigate substantially adverse acoustic effects. In this context, the proposed implementation is able to work in real time with high-resolution spatial grids and using up to 48 microphones. These results confirm the advantages of suitable GPU architectures in the development of real-time massive acoustic signal processing systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Graphics Processing Units; Microphone arrays; Sound source localization; Steered Response Power","Allen, J.B., Berkley, D.A., Image method for efficiently simulating small-room acoustics (1979) Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 65, pp. 943-950; Belloch, J.A., Gonzalez, A., Martinez-Zaldivar, F.J., Vidal, A.M., A real-time crosstalk canceller on a notebook GPU (2011) Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME), pp. 1-4. , Barcelona, Spain; Belloch J. ., A., Gonzalez, A., Vidal A. ., M., Cobos, M., Real-time sound source localization on graphics processing units (2013) Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Science, , ICCS 2013.

The CO2 streams captured from power plants or other large industrial processes contain a variety of impurities. This study investigates the effects of nitrogen (N2) on the dissolution trapping mechanism, which occurs when the injected CO2 mixture dissolves into the formation fluids. The density of the formation water/brine at the two-phase interface would increase in response to the dissolution of CO2. At favorable conditions, convection would be triggered and could greatly accelerate the dissolution rate of CO2. This density-driven convection process is beneficial for both storage security and permanence. However, N2 would lead to a density reduction of the aqueous phase when dissolved into the formation water/brine. The onset of convection would be delayed and the dissolution rate may be affected when co-injecting CO2 with N2.

There is a plethora of URL blacklists/reputation services, out of which Google's Safe Browsing and Microsoft's SmartScreen stand out as the two most commonly used ones. Frequently, such lists are the only safeguard web browsers implement against such threats. In this paper, we examine the level of protection that is offered by popular web browsers on iOS, Android and desktop (Windows) platforms, against a large set of phishing and malicious URL. The results reveal that most browsers - especially those for mobile devices - offer limited protection against such threats. As a result, we propose and evaluate a countermeasure, which can be used to significantly improve the level of protection offered to the users, regardless of the web browser or platform they are using. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A review of academic and practitioner literature revealed a lack of comprehensive and coherent guidance on how forensic readiness can be achieved. This is compounded by the lack of maturity in the discourse of digital forensics rooted in the informal definitions of key terms and concepts. In this paper we validate and refine a digital forensic readiness framework through a series of expert focus groups.

Analysis of in-core fuel performance is required for design and safety evaluations related to almost every aspect of the nuclear fuel cycle. This study presents a methodology for assessing the quality of uranium-molybdenum fuel images and describes image analysis routines designed for the characterization of several important microstructural properties. The analyses are performed in CellProfiler, an open-source program designed to enable biologists without training in computer vision or programming to automatically extract cellular measurements from large image sets. The quality metric scores an image based on three parameters: the illumination gradient across the image, the overall focus of the image, and the fraction of the image that contains scratches. The metric presents the user with the ability to 'pass' or 'fail' an image based on a reproducible quality score. Passable images may then be characterized through a separate CellProfiler pipeline, which enlists a variety of common image analysis techniques. The results demonstrate the ability to reliably pass or fail images based on the illumination, focus, and scratch fraction of the image, followed by automatic extraction of morphological data with respect to fission gas voids, interaction layers, and grain boundaries. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Animal models are useful for preclinical studies of gastrointestinal transit, but terminal methods do not allow later study, and stressful assessment methods will likely alter the transit of the animal. To overcome these factors, we developed a new method to assay rat total gastrointestinal transit. Methods: Standard plastic cages with their bottoms cut off were placed on wire mesh floors. Custom apparatuses were built to contain fecal pellets as they fell through the floors. Webcams connected to a computer running a security program were placed to image the pellets at regular intervals. Custom food was obtained with and without blue pigment. After habituating to the cages and the non-pigmented food, the pigmented food was administered. The duration to the appearance of the first pigmented pellet was determined by reviewing the photographs. This duration represents the complete gastrointestinal behavior, including feeding. We compared 24-hour fecal pellet counts using images to counts by visual inspection, and also made hourly counts. After establishing baseline transit times and hourly fecal pellet discharge, rats were given buprenorphine, known to alter gastrointestinal transit. Transit times and hourly discharge were obtained again and compared to the baselines. Results: The methods were successful in determining transit times. Baseline measures were consistent between three groups of 8 rats. Visual and image-based counts were highly correlated. Transit times and hourly pellet discharge were reduced by buprenorphine. Discussion: The described method offers a relatively simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive means to measure rat gastrointestinal behavior. The method has potential for any study where altered total gastrointestinal transit is an experimental concern. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Constipation; Digestion; Digestive diseases; Gastrointestinal; Methods; Rat; Transit time","Bauer, A.J., Two immune arms to stop one gut (2010) Nature Medicine, 16, pp. 1378-1379; Ebino, K.Y., Studies on coprophagy in experimental animals (1993) Jikken Dobutsu, 42, pp. 1-9; Kabadi, R., Kouya, F., Cohen, H.W., Banik, R.K., Spontaneous pain-like behaviors are more sensitive to morphine and buprenorphine than mechanically evoked behaviors in a rat model of acute postoperative pain (2015) Anesthesia and Analgesia, 120, pp. 472-478; Mattei, P., Rombeau, J.L., Review of the pathophysiology and management of postoperative ileus (2006) World Journal of Surgery, 30, pp. 1382-1391; Nakade, Y., Fukuda, H., Iwa, M., Tsukamoto, K., Yanagi, H., Yamamura, T., Restraint stress stimulates colonic motility via central corticotropin-releasing factor and peripheral 5-HT3 receptors in conscious rats (2007) American Journal of Physiology.

In this paper, a simple public-key attack is proposed to break this cryptosystem by using arbitrary position parameters and three public keys. The attack process is composed of two steps. Firstly, the decryption keys are simply generated with the help of arbitrary position parameters and the three public keys. Secondly, the two approximate values of the original images are obtained by using the generated decryption keys. Moreover, the proposed public-key attack is different from the existing attacks. It is not sensitive to position parameters of the double-images and the computing efficiency is also much better.

During the last decades, the lake area has seen extensive degradation in terms of water quality, erosion, deforestation, and biodiversity concomitant with a major shift to unsustainable land use. The study was conducted, with an emphasis on water quality, to analyze environmental impacts (effects) changing the ecosystem and to comprehensively evaluate the environmental state of the ecosystem through an innovative Rapid Cumulative Effects Assessment framework tool. The assessment started with a framework-forming Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), which quantified and prioritized impacts over space and time. Critically important impacts were assessed for “intra-inter interactions” using the loop analysis simulation. Water samples were analyzed while geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing were used to identify water pollution hotspots. It was concluded that out of a plethora of impacts, pollution from municipal sources, sedimentation, and effects exerted by floating gardens had the most detrimental impacts, which cumulatively affected the entire ecosystem. The framework tool was designed in a broad sense with a reference to highly needed assessments of poorly studied wetlands where degradation is evident, but scarcely quantified, and where long-term field studies are fraught with security issues and resource unavailability (post-conflict, poor and remote regions, e.g., Afghanistan, Laos, Sudan, etc.) © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Floating gardens; Intra-inter interactions; Participatory Rural Appraisal; Remote sensing; Water quality","Akaishi, F., Satake, M., Otaki, M., Tominaga, N., Surface water quality and information about the environment surrounding Inle Lake in Myanmar (2006) Japanese Society of Limnology, 7, pp. 57-62. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD28Xkt1Kiu78%3D; Brivio, P.A., Giardino, C., Zilioli, E., Validation of satellite data for quality assurance in lake monitoring applications (2001) Science of the Total Environment, 268, pp. 3-13; Cheng, C., Wei, Y., Sun, X., Zhou, Y., Estimation of chlorophyll-a concentration in Turbid Lake using spectral smoothing and derivative analysis (2013) International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 10, pp. 2979-2994. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXht1Shu77F; Cho, C.S., Corazon, L.R., The on-site cost of soil erosion by the replacement cost methods in Inle Lake watershed, Nyaung Shwe Township, Myanmar (2010) Journal of Environment Science and Management, 13 (1), pp. 67-81; Dambacher, J.M., Ramos-Jiliberto, R., Understanding and predicting effects of modified interactions through a qualitative analysis of community structure (2007) Quarterly Review of Biology, 82, pp. 227-250; Dube, M.G., Cumulative effects assessment in Canada: a regional framework for aquatic ecosystems (2003) Environmental Impact Assessment Review, 23, pp. 723-745; Elbeih, S., Impact of groundwater recharge on the surrounding environment.

In this paper, using complex features of P2P networks, we shift the focus to the study of invulnerability of grown P2P networks under progressive targeted attacks. Based on dynamic process and reverse percolation theory, we present several mechanisms that attacked P2P networks can adopt to minimize the disasters aftermath progressive targeted attacks. In this process, we proposed: (i) the dynamics of grown P2P networks under targeted attacks can make sure an attacked P2P network restore a power-law (PL) characteristic to a normal level; (ii) a global degree restoring process from the aftermath of progressive targeted attacks can restore the status of set of high degree peers to normal; (iii) a reverse percolation process glues the fragmented small connected component of a destroyed grown P2P network into a giant connected component (GCC). Experimental results show that an attacked grown P2P network can restore the key characteristics, such as power-law characteristic of original P2P network, the set of high degree peers and the giant connected component, to a regular status. In this way, we can illustrate the invulnerability of progressive targeted attacks on grown P2P networks which is particularly useful in designing complex P2P networks. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The algorithm, named RLSOD, is based on the Low-Security Observational Determinism criterion. It utilizes program dependence graphs for concurrent programs and is flow-sensitive, context-sensitive, object-sensitive, and optionally time-sensitive. Due to a new definition of low-equivalency for infinite traces, the algorithm avoids restrictions or soundness leaks of previous approaches. A soundness proof is provided. Flow sensitivity turns out to be the key to precision and avoids prohibition of useful nondeterminism. The algorithm has been implemented for full Java byte code with unlimited threads. Precision and scalability have been experimentally validated. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Information flow control; Noninterference; Program dependence graph; Software security","Abadi, M., Banerjee, A., Heintze, N., Riecke, J.G., A core calculus of dependency (1999) POPL ’99: Proceedings of the 26th ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, pp. 147-160. , ACM, New York:; Askarov, A., Hunt, S., Sabelfeld, A., Sands, D., Termination-insensitive noninterference leaks more than just a bit (2008) In Proceedings of ESORICS, volume 5283 of LNCS, pp. 333-348; Binkley, D., Harman, M., A survey of empirical results on program slicing (2004) Adv.

Authentication becomes an essential need when a remote patient logins into the telecare server. Recently, many extended chaotic maps based authentication schemes using smart cards for TMISs have been proposed. Li et al. proposed a secure smart cards based authentication scheme for TMISs using extended chaotic maps based on Lee’s and Jiang et al.’s scheme. In this study, we show that Li et al.’s scheme has still some weaknesses such as violation the session key security, vulnerability to user impersonation attack and lack of local verification. To conquer these flaws, we propose a chaotic maps and smart cards based password authentication scheme by applying biometrics technique and hash function operations. Through the informal and formal security analyses, we demonstrate that our scheme is resilient possible known attacks including the attacks found in Li et al.’s scheme. As compared with the previous authentication schemes, the proposed scheme is more secure and efficient and hence more practical for telemedical environments. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Authentication; Chebyshev chaotic maps; Smart cards; Telecare medicine information systems","Hsu, C.L., Lee, M.R., Su, C.H., The role of privacy protection in healthcare information systems adoption (2013) J.

Nevertheless, the existing incentive schemes as well as the packet forwarding protocols cannot well model continuous vehicle collaboration, resist vehicle compromise attacks and collusion attacks, leaving the privacy preservation issues untouched. In this paper, a novel threshold credit-based incentive mechanism (TCBI) is proposed based on the modified model of population dynamics to efficiently resist the node compromise attacks, stimulate the cooperation among intermediate nodes, maximize vehicular nodes' interest, and realize the fairness of possessing the same opportunity of transmitting packets for credits. Then, a TCBI-based privacy-preserving packet forwarding protocol is proposed to solve the open problem of resisting layer-adding attack by outsourcing the privacy-preserving aggregated transmission evidence generation for multiple resource-constrained vehicles to the cloud side from performing any one-way trapdoor function only once. The vehicle privacy is well protected from both the cloud and transportation manager. Finally, formal security proof and the extensive simulation show the effectiveness of our proposed TCBI in resisting the sophisticated attacks and the efficiency in terms of high reliability, high delivery ratio, and low average delay in cloud-assisted vehicular DTNs. © 2015 IEEE.","Cloud computing; delay tolerant network; security and privacy; VANETs","Daeinabi, A., Rahbar, A.G.P., Khademzadeh, A., VWCA: An efficient clustering algorithm in vehicular ad hoc networks (2011) J.

However, it brings about the challenge of keeping both the data confidentiality and patients' identity privacy simultaneously. Many existing access control and anonymous authentication schemes cannot be straightforwardly exploited. To solve the problem, in this paper, a novel authorized accessible privacy model (AAPM) is established. Patients can authorize physicians by setting an access tree supporting flexible threshold predicates. Then, based on it, by devising a new technique of attribute-based designated verifier signature, a patient self-controllable multi-level privacy-preserving cooperative authentication scheme (PSMPA) realizing three levels of security and privacy requirement in distributed m-healthcare cloud computing system is proposed. The directly authorized physicians, the indirectly authorized physicians and the unauthorized persons in medical consultation can respectively decipher the personal health information and/or verify patients' identities by satisfying the access tree with their own attribute sets. Finally, the formal security proof and simulation results illustrate our scheme can resist various kinds of attacks and far outperforms the previous ones in terms of computational, communication and storage overhead. © 2014 IEEE.","access control; Authentication; distributed cloud computing; m-healthcare system; security and privacy","Gatzoulis, L., Iakovidis, I., Wearable and portable E-health systems (2007) IEEE Eng.

The federal government is spending significant resources developing new detection systems and attempting to increase the performance of existing ones. The detection of illicit radionuclides that may pose a radiological or nuclear threat is a challenging problem complicated by benign radiation sources (e.g., cat litter and medical treatments), shielding, and large variations in background radiation. Although there is a growing acceptance within the community that concentrating efforts on algorithm development (independent of the specifics of fully assembled systems) has the potential for significant overall system performance gains, there are two major hindrances to advancements in gamma spectral analysis algorithms under the current paradigm: access to data and common performance metrics along with baseline performance measures. Because many of the signatures collected during performance measurement campaigns are classified, dissemination to algorithm developers is extremely limited. This leaves developers no choice but to collect their own data if they are lucky enough to have access to material and sensors. This is often combined with their own definition of metrics for measuring performance. These two conditions make it all but impossible for developers and external reviewers to make meaningful comparisons between algorithms. Without meaningful comparisons, performance advancements become very hard to achieve and (more importantly) recognize. The objective of this work is to overcome these obstacles by developing and freely distributing real and synthetically generated gamma-spectra data sets as well as software tools for performance evaluation with associated performance baselines to national labs, academic institutions, government agencies, and industry. At present, datasets for two tracks, or application domains, have been developed: one that includes temporal spectral data at 1 s time intervals, which represents data collected by a mobile system operating in a dynamic radiation background environment; and one that represents static measurements with a foreground spectrum (background plus source) and a background spectrum. These data include controlled variations in both Source Related Factors (nuclide, nuclide combinations, activities, distances, collection times, shielding configurations, and background spectra) and Detector Related Factors (currently only gain shifts, but resolution changes and non-linear energy calibration errors will be added soon). The software tools will allow the developer to evaluate the performance impact of each of these factors. Although this first implementation is somewhat limited in scope, considering only NaI-based detection systems and two application domains, it is hoped that (with community feedback) a wider range of detector types and applications will be included in the future. This article describes the methods used for dataset creation, the software validation/performance measurement tools, the performance metrics used, and examples of baseline performance. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

By using this technology, these systems are able to automatically interpret visual data from the environment and perform tasks that would have been unthinkable years ago. These achievements represent a radical improvement but they also suppose a new threat to individual's privacy. The new capabilities of such systems give them the ability to collect and index a huge amount of private information about each individual. Next-generation systems have to solve this issue in order to obtain the users' acceptance. Therefore, there is a need for mechanisms or tools to protect and preserve people's privacy. This paper seeks to clarify how privacy can be protected in imagery data, so as a main contribution a comprehensive classification of the protection methods for visual privacy as well as an up-to-date review of them are provided. A survey of the existing privacy-aware intelligent monitoring systems and a valuable discussion of important aspects of visual privacy are also provided. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This functionality is very useful in many applications that require the linkability but still need the anonymity, such as sybil attack detection in a vehicular ad hoc network and privacy-preserving data mining. In this paper, we present a new group signature scheme supporting the controllable linkability. The major advantage of this scheme is that the signature length is very short, even shorter than this in the best-known group signature scheme without supporting the linkability. We have implemented our scheme in both a Linux machine with an Intel Core2 Quad and an iPhone4. We compare the results with a number of existing group signature schemes. We also prove security features of our scheme, such as anonymity, traceability, nonframeability, and linkability, under a random oracle model. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Anonymity; Group signature; Linkability; Privacy","Ateniese, G., Camenisch, J., Joye, M., Tsudik, G., A practical and provably secure coalition-resistant group signature scheme (2000) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1880, pp. 255-270. , Advances in Cryptology Berlin, Germany: Springer-Verlag; Boneh, D., Boyen, X., Short signatures without random oracles and the SDH assumption in bilinear groups (2008) J.

This cooperation is a cost-intensive activity and some nodes can refuse to cooperate, leading to a selfish node behaviour. Thus, the overall network performance could be seriously affected. The use of watchdogs is a well-known mechanism to detect selfish nodes. However, the detection process performed by watchdogs can fail, generating false positives and false negatives that can induce to wrong operations. Moreover, relying on local watchdogs alone can lead to poor performance when detecting selfish nodes, in term of precision and speed. This is specially important on networks with sporadic contacts, such as delay tolerant networks (DTNs), where sometimes watchdogs lack of enough time or information to detect the selfish nodes. Thus, we propose collaborative contact-based watchdog (CoCoWa) as a collaborative approach based on the diffusion of local selfish nodes awareness when a contact occurs, so that information about selfish nodes is quickly propagated. As shown in the paper, this collaborative approach reduces the time and increases the precision when detecting selfish nodes. © 2014 IEEE.","MANETs; opportunistic and delay tolerant networks; performance evaluation; selfish nodes; Wireless networks","Abbas, S., Merabti, M., Llewellyn-Jones, D., Kifayat, K., Lightweight sybil attack detection in manets (2013) IEEE Syst.

In the recent past, it has been found that the web is also being used as a tool by radical or extremist groups and users to practice several kinds of mischievous acts with concealed agendas and promote ideologies in a sophisticated manner. Some of the web forums are predominantly being used for open discussions on critical issues influenced by radical thoughts. The influential users dominate and influence the newly joined innocent users through their radical thoughts. This paper presents an application of collocation theory to identify radically influential users in web forums. The radicalness of a user is captured by a measure based on the degree of match of the commented posts with a threat list. Eleven different collocation metrics are formulated to identify the association among users, and they are finally embedded in a customized PageRank algorithm to generate a ranked list of radically influential users. The experiments are conducted on a standard data set provided for a challenge at ISI-KDD'12 workshop to find radical and infectious threads, members, postings, ideas, and ideologies. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the existing UserRank algorithm. We also found that the collocation theory is more effective to deal with such ranking problem than the textual and temporal similarity-based measures studied earlier. © 2015 IEEE.","Radical user identification; Security informatics; Social media analysis; Users collocation analysis","Qin, J., Zhou, Y., Chen, H., A multi-region empirical study on the Internet presence of global extremist organizations (2011) Inf.

Although it has lots of benefits, it has created a space in which the criminals can commit a crime as well. In this study we focused on internet frauds and according to 321 managers of private companies who answered the questions about the factors of committing internet frauds according to the frauds they had reported to Cyberspace Surveillance and Scam Monitoring Agency of Iran about their employees, we argued that there are two main groups of factors, (1) individual and inter-organizational factors including organization structure, personality-job fit, conflicts between individuals and the organization, performance evaluation system, supervision and control, (2) environmental and external factors including rules and regulations, economic and political conditions, infrastructure, culture. To rank the value of these factors we used Friedman test. We believe that cyberspace is a unique and important tool for organizations to utilize, but if not used well, these kinds of crimes that have already emerged, and those yet to emerge, will continue to be ineffectively addressed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Cloud users can deploy an arbitrary computation cluster to public clouds and execute their programs on that remote cluster to reduce infrastructure investment and maintenance costs. However, how to leverage cloud resources while keeping the computation confidential is a new challenge to be explored. In this paper, we propose runtime control flow obfuscation (RCFO) to protect the control flow confidentiality of outsourced programs. RCFO transforms an outsourced program into two parts: the public program running on the untrusted public cloud and the private program running on the trusted private cloud. By hiding parts of the control flow information in the private program and inserting fake branch statements into the public program, RCFO raises the bar for static and dynamic analysis-based reverse engineering attacks. Based on RCFO, we implement a system called MRDisguiser to protect cloud-based MapReduce services. We perform experiments on a real MapReduce service, Amazon Elastic MapReduce. The experimental results indicate that MRDisguiser is compatible with current cloud-based MapReduce services, and incurs moderate performance overhead. Specifically, when the obfuscation degree increases from 0 to 1.0, the average performance overhead is between 14.9% and 33.2%. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This drives the need of a flexible, lightweight and adaptive access control mechanism to cope with the pervasive nature of such global ecosystem, ensuring, at the same time, reliable communications between trusted devices. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a flexible trust-aware access control system for IoT (TACIoT), which provides an end-to-end and reliable security mechanism for IoT devices, based on a lightweight authorization mechanism and a novel trust modelthat has been specially devised for IoT environments. TACIoT extends traditional access control systems by taking into account trust values which are based on reputation, quality of service, security considerations and devices’ social relationships.

It is unique in combining three different spreading strategies: local probing, neighbourhood probing, and global probing. We propose a mathematical model that combines three modes of spreading: local, neighbourhood, and global, to capture the worm's spreading behaviour. The parameters of the model are inferred directly from network data obtained during the first day of the Conficker epidemic. The model is then used to explore the tradeoff between spreading modes in determining the worm's effectiveness. Our results show that the Conficker epidemic is an example of a critically hybrid epidemic, in which the different modes of spreading in isolation do not lead to successful epidemics. Such hybrid spreading strategies may be used beneficially to provide the most effective strategies for promulgating information across a large population. When used maliciously, however, they can present a dangerous challenge to current internet security protocols. © 2015 Zhang et al.",,"House, T., Modelling epidemics on networks (2012) Contemp Phys., 53 (3), p. 213; Rock, K., Brand, S., Moir, J., Keeling, M.J., Dynamics of infectious diseases (2014) Rep Prog Phys., 77 (2), p. 026602. , 24444713 Feb; Zheng, Y., Huang, B., Wang, Y., Sun, X., Jin, Z., Zhang, J., Transmission dynamics and control for a brucellosis model in Hinggan League of Inner Mongolia, China (2014) Math Biosci Eng., 11 (5), pp. 1115-1137. , 25347802 Jun; Nie, J., Sun, G.Q., Sun, X.D., Zhang, J., Wang, N., Wang, Y.M., Modeling the transmission dynamics of dairy cattle brucellosis in jilin province, china (2014) J Biol Syst., 22 (4), pp. 533-554. , May; Li, M.T., Sun, G.Q., Wu, Y.F., Zhang, J., Jin, Z., Transmission dynamics of a multi-group brucellosis model with mixed cross infection in public farm (2014) Appl Math Comput., 237, pp. 582-594. , Jun; Zou, C.C., Towsley, D., Gong, W., On the performance of Internet worm scanning strategies (2006) Perform Eval., 63 (7), pp. 700-723. , Jul; Shin, S., Gu, G., Reddy, N., Lee, C.P., A large-scale empirical study of conficker (2012) IEEE Trans Inf Forensics Secur., 7 (2), pp. 676-690. , Apr; Yu, S., Gu, G., Barnawi, A., Guo, S., Stojmenovic, I., Malware propagation in large-scale networks (2015) IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng., 27 (1), pp. 170-179. , Jan; Ren, Z., Liu, W., Zhou, X., Fang, J., Chen, Q., Summary-vector-based effective and fast immunization for epidemic-based routing in opportunistic networks (2014) IEEE Commun Lett., 18 (7), pp. 1183-1186. , Jul; Chen, P.Y., Cheng, S.M., Chen, K.C., Optimal control of epidemic information dissemination over networks (2014) IEEE T Cybern., 44 (12), pp. 2316-2328. , Dec; Sahneh, F.D., Chowdhury, F.N., Brase, G., Scoglio, C.M., Individual-based information dissemination in multilayer epidemic modeling (2014) Math Model Nat Phenom., 9 (2), pp. 136-152. , Jan; Zhang, J., Sun, G.Q., Sun, X.D., Hou, Q., Li, M., Huang, B., Prediction and control of brucellosis transmission of Dairy Cattle in Zhejiang Province, China (2014) PLoS ONE, 9 (11), p. e108592. , 25386963 Nov; Zhang, J., Jin, Z., Sun, G.Q., Sun, X.D., Wang, Y.M., Huang, B., Determination of original infection source of H7N9 avian influenza by dynamical model (2014) Sci Rep., 4, p. 4846. , 24786135 May; Moore, D., Paxson, V., Savage, S., Shannon, C., Staniford, S., Weaver, N., Inside the Slammer worm (2003) IEEE Secur Priv., 1 (4), pp. 33-39. , Aug; Shannon, C., Moore, D., The spread of the Witty worm (2004) IEEE Secur Priv., 2 (4), pp. 46-50. , Aug; Zhang, C., Zhou, S., Cox, I.J., Chain, B.M., (2014) Optimizing Hybrid Spreading in Metapopulations, , Preprint.

In the IoT, millions of objects with sensors collect data and send the data to servers that analyze, manage and use the data in order to construct some kinds of smart systems, such as smart grid, intelligent transportation systems, healthcare systems and even smart city. It is critical to establish a secure channel between the sensors and servers in order to ensure the correctness of collected data. If the collected data is tampered, the results of data analysis is unbelievable, and may even bring serious disaster. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous ring signcryption scheme for secure communication from sensors to servers. We prove that this scheme has the indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2) and existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen messages attacks under the computational Diffie–Hellman problem in the random oracle model. Our scheme has the following advantages (1) it simultaneously achieves confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and anonymity in a logical single step; (2) it is heterogeneous and allows a sensor node in an identity-based cryptography to send a message to a server in a public key infrastructure. These features make our scheme suitable for data transmission in the IoT. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Identity-based cryptography; Internet of Things; Public key infrastructure; Security; Signcryption",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929438899

We propose a tamper-evident architecture (TEA) which samples runtime signals in a hardware system during the performance of a computation, and generates a cryptographic hash-based fingerprint that uniquely identifies a sequence of sampled signals. A hardware Trojan cannot tamper with any sampled signal without leaving tamper evidence such as a missing or incorrect fingerprint. We further verify fingerprints off-chip such that a hardware Trojan cannot tamper with the verification process. As a case study, we detect hardware-based code injection attacks in a SPARC V8 architecture LEON2 processor. Based on a lightweight block cipher called PRESENT, a TEA requires only a 4.5% area increase, while avoiding being detected by the TEA increases the area of a code injection hardware Trojan with a 1 KB ROM from 2.5% to 36.1% of a LEON2 processor. Such a low cost further enables more advanced tamper diagnosis techniques based on a concurrent generation of multiple fingerprints.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929587463

Network intrusion detection system monitors the network traffic and measures the information to identify the suspicious activities. In distributed networks, the network administrator has to authorize the user data access. When large data set is concerned in network applications the two complex issues to be solved are the organization of information and decision making. To address these issues, a space efficient data structure, called the bloom filter is used which effectively organizes and decides the presence of reliability. However, using advanced filtering techniques, the intruders easily hack the authorized data for unauthorized operations. At the same time, when processing the information, it is difficult to access the data in a secured manner using the standard bloom filters. To enhance the security over the user data access from the intruders, an enhanced bloom filter technique is presented to represent the large set of data in secure manner applied in distributed applications like web caching, peer networks etc. Additionally, to restrict the unauthorized access over the dataset from malicious activities by intruders, the enhanced bloom filter is applied with an upper bound on the false-positive probability by increasing its capacity as the packet data size increases. The occurrence of network data traffic is cleared by mapping the set of data elements to the appropriate setting in the database using hash functions, minimizing the number of resets created and at the same time improving the mean hit ratio. An experimental evaluation is done with the KDD cup 1999 dataset extracted from UCI repository to estimate the performance of the proposed link-based mapping for network intrusion detection system with enhanced bloom filters. Performance evaluation is measured in terms of false positive probability, false negative probability, mean hit ratio, scalability, number of resets created and security. The experimental results reveals that security over the packet data achieves 42.5 % higher against existing dynamic bloom filter approach. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Authorization; Bloom filters; Enhanced bloom filters; Information representation; Security; Web log data",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929428469

In this paper, we propose the use of quality-based design that modifies this standard process so that those NFRs, which actually reflect the true business needs, are addressed first. This is accomplished through a combination of quality attribute workshops, to elicit and refine quality-based mission objectives, and attribute-driven design, where design heuristics, termed tactics, can be employed in the decomposition of the system. This ensures that the final system better reflects and embodies those architecturally significant requirements rather than having them addressed secondarily. This is an important change since the “ilities” are systemic properties (properties of the system as a whole) rather than properties of individual components or subsystems. Consequently, they are difficult to address in an architecture that has already been decomposed with respect to required functionality. To illustrate the proposed approach, we provide an example based upon the Department of Defense Pre-positioned Expeditionary Assistance Kit.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929207018

In this paper, a real-time automatic obstacle recognition method based on computer vision technology is presented. The proposed method aims at detecting and recognizing the road obstacles such as abandoned objects, accident vehicles and illegally parked vehicles, which can prevent the traffic accident effectively. In the method, the target images are captured by a visible image sensor firstly. In order to avoid the static objects disappearing from foreground in short time when using GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model), background is built and foreground objects are extracted by the proposed algorithm SUOG (Selective Updating of GMM). Relative object speed is used to detect the static obstacles, and FROI (Flushed Region of Interest) algorithm based on the concept of connected domain, is presented to eliminate noises outside road and improve real-time capability. At last, a classification method of adaptive interested region based on HOG and SVM, and a new recognition algorithm of accident vehicles based on multi-feature fusion are proposed to classify the road obstacles. Experiments indicate that the detection rate of the proposed obstacle detection method is up to 96 % in urban road traffic. Through experiment, it is shown that the developed obstacle detection method has low computational complexity, and can fulfill the requirement of real-time applications, and it is correct and effective. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Feature extraction; Obstacle detection; SVM; Video surveillance",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929119236

This study presents a multi-model approach to analysing climate change impacts and associated risks for staple food crops in Nigeria. Previous attempts to evaluate climate change impacts in Nigeria had mainly focused on a reduced number of crops, with analysis limited to single experimental fields or specific areas, and in many cases considering only a limited number of climate models. In this work, crop simulation models implemented in the DSSAT-CSM software were used to evaluate climate change impacts on crop production in different Agro-Ecological Zones, considering multiple combinations of soils and climate conditions, varieties and crop management. The climate impact assessment was made using an ensemble of future climate projections, to include uncertainty related to climate projections. Even if precipitations could increase in most parts of Nigeria, this is not likely to offset the crop yield reduction due to the increase in temperatures, particularly over the medium-term period (2050), with yield decreases projected especially for cereals. The short-term effects are more uncertain and yields for cassava and millet might actually increase by 2020. Moreover, yield reductions are only partially mitigated by the direct effect of increased CO<inf>2</inf> atmospheric concentration enhancing crop yield. In both periods and for all crops, there is a higher risk that crop yields may fall below the actual risk threshold. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929093916

These mechanisms seek to reduce recovery time, which remains undesirably long in the current routing protocols in wired and wireless networks. Hence, we evaluate the efficiency of the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol with and without recovery paths under varying environment with different node densities. In addition, the mobility of nodes is changing the speed movements when they start to move from area to another one. This paper assists in ascertaining the effect of varying node densities on the connectivity’s life between mobile nodes in the network. Hence, it showed the effect of a local recovery mechanism resulted in achieving a significant improvement in network performance by seeking a long life backup path between source and destination for different nodes density. Real time applications are required to be supported by mobile ad hoc networks by finding an efficient recovery mechanism. This is because the MANET networks allow the nodes to move from one area to another without any notification. The real time applications traffics are considered as a sensitive application, and it is the most affected by failure through the occurrence of delay and loss of packets. It is, therefore, not suitable for use by players. In mobile ad hoc networks, routing protocol functions are based on many factors, such as, node mobility and density and broken paths. According to these factors, the paper was further extended to develop a recovery mechanism in MANET based on the mobility and density of nodes to alleviate the impact of the frequent loss of connection due to the flexibility of free nodes, which move from one area to another without pre-notification.The aim behind recovery mechanism is to reduce current recovery time to enhance the Quality of Service in the MANET. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Alternative routing table (ART); Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV); Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET); Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR)",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929121246

An effective fitness function is used to define the fitness of each rule. Each chromosome will have one or more rules in it. As each chromosome is a complete solution to the problem, fewer chromosomes are sufficient for effective intrusion detection. This reduces the computational time.

Securing health information from malicious attacks has become a major concern. However, securing the data from attacks sometimes fail and attackers succeed in inserting malicious data.

Visualization techniques can convert abstract data into visual sensitive graphics; thus, forensic officers can extract useful information quickly. In this paper, we present a matrix-based visualization system for visualized forensic analysis on unintelligible traffic datasets. The system consists of three collaborative views, including the Timeline view integrating active features and individual dispersions based on information entropies for the perception of the overall time series, the Matrix view balancing the expression of network structure and distributions of IPs and ports for efficient events tracing, and the Historical view comparing statuses in successive time slots for dynamic trends tracking. The system provides a multilevel analysis architecture and multifaceted perspectives for comprehensive cognition in traffic forensics. In case studies, we describe the forensic process of this system, including identifying port scan, distributed denial of service, and botnet attacks, on the datasets in VAST Challenge 2013.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929000047

The entire P2P research can be divided into four areas: search, storage, security and sharing. In various circumstances, the P2P network makes sense in effective communication. The P2P networking increases the QOS, in terms of communication speed, delay, data success rate and less data loss and so on. Due to its open nature system, it deployed hugely in the area of transferring large files and it easily exposes them to the malicious activities. The election of malicious or compromised peer as a peer head is one of the most significant breaches in peer-to-peer networks. In light of these issues, we focus the improvement of P2P network performance by following the given mechanisms. Mechanism 1: topology construction based on grouping of similar interest peer (GOSIP). Mechanism 2: electing the peer-heads for each GOSIP, based on the trust-threshold value given by each peers about their neighbor peers and considering the MAC address of the top listed peers in each group. In this paper, the P2P functionality is improved in such a way that the number of request is reduced and the neighborhood peers communication is improved by finding optimized neighbor using GOSIP algorithm. We have taken these mechanisms into the test-bed through simulation. The simulations outcomes flashed out clearly that these methods significantly improve 25 % of network Scalability and 50 % of throughputs, in turn improvise the performance of P2P networks efficiently when compared to the existing methodologies. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","GOSIP; MAC address identity; Peer-head election; Trust-based peer-head",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928969569

Therefore, the critical systems lifecycle—primarily software-intensive systems—demands new approaches for conducting the safety analysis process while staying within reasonable cost limits and maintaining the quality of the results. This paper proposes a practical analytical approach for increasing the confidence in software safety arguments in safety cases through the elaboration and assessment of counterevidence that emerges from software failure modes due to robustness issues. A case study is presented in which the proposed approach is applied to a computer-based distributed critical system. Additionally, practical results from the application of this approach to real safety-critical systems are also presented. The proposed approach proved to be useful during safety analysis processes, mainly in independent safety analysis projects, as it improves assessment coverage with low impact on workload and costs.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928964281

Using the features of UBQC, we propose a protocol to achieve symmetrically private information retrieval, which allows a quantum limited Alice to query an item from Bob with a fully fledged quantum computer; meanwhile, the privacy of both parties is preserved. The security of our protocol is based on the assumption that malicious Alice has no quantum computer, which avoids the impossibility proof of Lo.

It is known that packet transmission in wide area networks is a complex stochastic process; thus, low bandwidth as well as high delay, jitter, and packet loss will greatly affect the quality of service (QoS) of teleoperation control, which is unacceptable in this kind of sensitive application. Furthermore, a relevant but more serious issue is the network attacks, particularly denial of service as well as data alteration or disclosure. The main motivation of this study is to deploy suitable security mechanisms while preserving the QoS of network-based bilateral teleoperation. We propose and apply a protocol that secures our teleoperation system while preserving its real-time constraints. More precisely, we present in this paper a bilateral generalized predictive controller coupled to a QoS-friendly IP security protocol. The experimental results demonstrate that the telerobotic system is able to satisfy both QoS and security requirements of real-time and sensitive teleoperation tasks. In fact, our teleoperation security protocol provides priority treatment while preventing attacks and avoiding potential deadline misses due to increased security cost.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928969222

Analyses for most implementations account for brute-force security only. There are, however, other risks that have to be consider, such as false-accept attacks, record multiplicity attacks, and information leakage from auxiliary data, such as alignment parameters. In fact, the existing work lacks analyses of these weaknesses and are even susceptible to a variety of them. In view of these vulnerabilities, we redesign a minutiae-based fuzzy vault implementation preventing an adversary from running attacks via record multiplicity. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for robust absolute fingerprint prealignment. In combination, we obtain a fingerprint-based fuzzy vault that resists known record multiplicity attacks and that does not leak information about the protected fingerprints from auxiliary alignment data. By experiments, we evaluate the performance of our security-improved implementation that, even though it has slight usability merits as compared with other minutiae-based implementations, provides improved security. However, despite heavy efforts spent in improving security, our implementation is, like all other implementations based on a single finger, subjected to a fundamental security limitation related to the false acceptance rate, i.e., false-accept attack. Consequently, this paper supports the notion that a single finger is not sufficient to provide acceptable security. Instead, implementations for multiple finger or even multiple modalities should be deployed the security of which may be improved by the technical contributions of this paper. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","cryptanalyses; fingerprint; fuzzy vault scheme; implementation; minutiae; security","Schneier, B., (1995) Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C, , 2nd ed.

Several secure BGP schemes have been proposed to prevent routing attacks by leveraging cryptographic verification of BGP routing updates. In this paper, we present a new type of attacks, called TIGER, which aims to invalidate the 'proven' security of these secure BGP schemes and allow ASes to announce forged routes even under full deployment of any existing secure BGP proposal. By launching TIGER attacks, malicious ASes can easily generate and announce forged routes which can be successfully verified by the existing secure BGP schemes. Furthermore, TIGER attacks can evade existing routing anomaly detection schemes by guaranteeing routing data-plane availability and consistency of control- and data-plane. Toward a new securing BGP scheme, we propose Anti-TIGER to detect and defend against TIGER attacks. Anti-TIGER enables robust TIGER detection by collaborations between ASes. In particular, we leverage Spread Spectrum Communication technique to watermark certain special probing packets, which manifest the existence of TIGER attacks. Anti-TIGER does not require any modifications in routing data-plane, therefore it is easy to deploy and incrementally deployable. We evaluate the effectiveness of TIGER and Anti-TIGER by experiments with real AS topologies of the Internet. Our experiment results show that TIGER attacks can successfully hijack a considerable number of prefixes. In the meanwhile, Anti-TIGER can achieve 100 percent detection ratio of TIGER attacks. © 2015 IEEE.","BGPsec; border gateway protocol; defense; detection; Hijacking; tiger","(2010), http://www.ren-esys.com/blog/2010/11/chinas-18-minute-mystery.shtml, China's 18-minute mystery(2009), http://www.renesys.com/tech/presentations/pdf/blackhat-09.pdf, Defending against BGP man-in-the-middle attacks(2013), Detecting IPv6 tunnels in an enterprise network(2013), http://www.routeviews.org, The route view project /(2008), http://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-16/dc16-presentations/defcon-16-pilosov-kapela.pdf, Stealing the internet: An internet-scale man in the middle attack(2013), http://www.cymru.com/BGP/summary.html, TEAM CYMRU BGP/ASN analysis report(2008), http://www.ripe.net/news/study-youtube-hijacking.html, Youtube hijacking: A RIPE NCC RIS case studyBallani, H., Francis, P., Zhang, X., A study of prefix hijacking and interception in the internet (2007) Proc.

Some works conducted over the last years have pointed out that such algorithms are generally susceptible to deception, notably in the form of attacks carefully constructed to evade detection. Various learning schemes have been proposed to overcome this weakness. One such system is Keyed IDS (KIDS), introduced at DIMVA '10. KIDS' core idea is akin to the functioning of some cryptographic primitives, namely to introduce a secret element (the key) into the scheme so that some operations are infeasible without knowing it. In KIDS the learned model and the computation of the anomaly score are both key-dependent, a fact which presumably prevents an attacker from creating evasion attacks. In this work we show that recovering the key is extremely simple provided that the attacker can interact with KIDS and get feedback about probing requests. We present realistic attacks for two different adversarial settings and show that recovering the key requires only a small amount of queries, which indicates that KIDS does not meet the claimed security properties. We finally revisit KIDS' central idea and provide heuristic arguments about its suitability and limitations. © 2015 IEEE.","Adversarial classification; anomaly detection; intrusion detection systems; secure machine learning","Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

The other three six-qubit DF states can be obtained by permuting the outputs of the setup for |0′. By using the |0′ state as the decoy state, the detection rate and the qubit error rate reach 81.3%, and they will not change with the noise level.

We analyzed different types of such attacks with their potential impacts on the energy consumption, modeled their behavior and quantified how current energy-proportional technologies may provide attackers with great opportunities for raising the target facility emissions and costs.

The governing equations for such flows are a set of two coupled non-linear hyperbolic partial differential equations where the friction factor is a very important parameter. In these equations, the gravity force is introduced to take into account the pipeline inclination. The mathematical equations are solved in the time domain by the method of characteristics using linear integration. To reproduce correctly the transient flow, very small time increments were used in the constructed computer program. This program permits to get some systematic indications on the evolution and the damping of the pressure head waves due to a fast closing valve at the downstream end of a long pipeline. The study shows that results are different from those of short pipelines and small viscous fluids. To check the validity of the numerical model, computed results have been successfully compared with those found in the relevant literature. These results show that the gravity lift may have an important effect on the maximum pressures, which may become very important near the valve and cause failure of the pipeline especially in presence of defect. The safety factor, computed at equidistant sections of the line, determines the distance between the reservoir and the defect from which the failure may happen. For the considered application, results show that the pipeline is safe near the supply upstream tank. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Failure assessment diagram; Long pipeline; Method of characteristics; Volumetric method; Water hammer","Chaudhry, M.H., (1979) Applied hydraulic transients, , Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York, [first edition 1979, second edition 1987]; Streeter, V.L., Wylie, E.B., (1967) Hydraulic transients, , McGraw-Hill Book Compagny, New York; Wylie, E.B., Streeter, V.L., (1978) Fluid transients, , Mac Graw-Hill Company, New York; Wylie, E.B., Streeter, V.L., Suo, L., (1993) Fluid transients in system, , Prentice Hall, New Jersey; Abott, M.B., (1966) An introduction to the method of the characteristics, , American Elsevier, New York; Bergeron, L., Du Coup de Bélier en Hydraulique Au Coup de Foudre en Électricité (1949) Water Hammer in hydraulics and wave surges in electricity.

However, how to design an efficient path-planning algorithm to achieve a globally optimal vehicle-Traffic control still remains a challenging problem, particularly when we take drivers' individual preferences into consideration. In this paper, we first establish a hybrid intelligent transportation system (ITS), i.e., a hybrid-VANET-enhanced ITS, which utilizes both vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) and cellular systems of the public transportation system to enable real-Time communications among vehicles, roadside units (RSUs), and a vehicle-Traffic server in an efficient way. Then, we propose a real-Time path-planning algorithm, which not only improves the overall spatial utilization of a road network but reduces average vehicle travel cost for avoiding vehicles from getting stuck in congestion as well. A stochastic Lyapunov optimization technique is exploited to address the globally optimal path-planning problem. Finally, the transmission delay of the hybrid-VANET-enhanced ITS is evaluated in VISSIM to show the timeliness of the proposed communication framework. Moreover, system-level simulations conducted in Java demonstrate that the proposed path-planning algorithm outperforms the traditional distributed path planning in terms of balancing the spatial utilization and drivers' travel cost. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Hybrid VANETs; path planning; spatial utilization; travel cost","(2007) Texas Transportation Institute: Urban Mobility Information Annual Urban Mobility Report, , http://mobility.tamu.edu/ums, Texas Transp.

The antenna system has a double-ring structure and can be integrated with the metal frame of mobile terminals. With the multimode excitation, the MIMO cellular antenna can operate at 830-900 MHz, 1700-2200 MHz, and 2400-2700 MHz, for 2G, 3G, and LTE bands, respectively. The MIMO Wi-Fi antenna can cover two Wi-Fi bands from 2.4 to 2.5 GHz and from 5.2 to 5.8 GHz. The effect of a user's body on the MIMO cellular antenna is investigated on CTIA standard phantoms and a real user. Since our antenna mainly operates in the loop mode, it has a much lower efficiency loss than conventional mobile antennas in both talking and data modes. Our theoretical analysis and experiments have shown that our design has low body loss and an attractive industrial design. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","body effect; loop antenna; LTE; MIMO antenna; mobile terminal; Wi-Fi","Ying, Z., Antennas in cellular phones for mobile communications (2012) Proc.

Although tabulation method is quite suitable to describe the mapping relation among discrete variables, there are numerous if-else sentences for the state decision of independent variables in computer programming. In this paper, we define an analytic function of the local rules of an Elementary Cellular Automaton by constructing the recognition function of the states of the cell and the neighbors. Therefore, a huge number of calculations by if-else sentences are transferred to the function calculation due to the adoption of the function of the local rules during the evolution of the ECA. Finally, the simulation results show that the programming structure is optimized and the programming efficiency is enhanced. In addition, the proposed method can also be extended to other 2-state cellular automata. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Many state-of-the-art approaches to image segmentation use structured models whose parameters must be carefully chosen for optimal performance. A popular choice is to learn them using a large-margin framework and more specifically structured support vector machines (SSVM). Although SSVMs are appealing, they suffer from certain limitations. First, they are restricted in practice to linear kernels because the more powerful nonlinear kernels cause the learning to become prohibitively expensive. Second, they require iteratively finding the most violated constraints, which is often intractable for the loopy graphical models used in image segmentation. This requires approximation that can lead to reduced quality of learning. In this paper, we propose three novel techniques to overcome these limitations. We first introduce a method to 'kernelize' the features so that a linear SSVM framework can leverage the power of nonlinear kernels without incurring much additional computational cost. Moreover, we employ a working set of constraints to increase the reliability of approximate subgradient methods and introduce a new way to select a suitable step size at each iteration. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on both 2-D and 3-D electron microscopic (EM) image data and show consistent performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Computer vision; electron microscopy; image processing; image segmentation; kernel methods; mitochondria; segmentation; statistical machine learning; structured prediction; superpixels; supervoxels","Achanta, R., Shaji, A., Smith, K., Lucchi, A., Fua, P., Susstrunk, S., SLIC superpixels compared to state-of-the-art superpixel methods (2012) IEEE Trans.

Korfantego 38, Katowice, Poland","The growing threat of unlawful interference and terrorist acts has led to widespread implementation of screening systems for checking people and baggage at airports. Introducing limits regarding objects permitted to be transported and screening procedures themselves have decreased the comfort of travelling and reduced the capacity of terminals. It is therefore important to examine the efficiency of screening, whether carried out under regular circumstances or in a situation where threat level is high. The purpose of this study is to develop an effective method and calculation tool making it possible to quickly and exactly determine the effectiveness of cabin baggage screening, depending on the equipment available, the choice of screening staff, and the organisational solutions applied. What is more, the human factor is of great significance as far as cabin baggage screening is concerned. It introduces a certain amount of subjectivity, imprecision, and incompleteness of description. Due to this, fuzzy reasoning solutions have been employed. The results indicate that it is possible for the efficiency of cabin baggage screening to vary significantly at various screening checkpoints (SC), even within one airport. It is also demonstrated that it is possible to actually manage the level of screening efficiency, also in a situation where the risk of an attack is greater than usual. One should avoid taking global decisions and, instead, focus on assessing screening at particular SCs and take steps on the basis of the results of such an assessment. Results obtained with the use of a computer tool under the name of COBAFAS demonstrate that it is then possible to improve the efficiency of screening without hindering the capacity of the airport at the same time. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Air transport safety and security; Flexible response to the threat of terrorism; Fuzzy reasoning; Hand baggage screening; Human factor","Alards-Tomalin, D., Ansons, T.L., Reich, T.C., Sakamoto, Y., Davie, R., Leboe-McGowan, J.P., Leboe-McGowan, L.C., Airport security measures and their influence on enplanement intentions: Responses from leisure travellers attending a Canadian University (2014) J.

QCA is a promising alternative to the current CMOS technology. It can be implemented at the nanoscale, reaching ultra-low power consumption and high clock rate. Communication systems are important in current computer systems and it is expected to be even more important in near future. Although QCA has been widely studied in the development of logic circuits, there are few studies applying this promising technology to the design of communication systems. In a bottom-up approach, we describe the parallel-to-serial and serial-to-parallel converters, which are essential to the serial communication. We also propose and present components for robust communication, such as QCA circuits for Hamming code and parity checker. We demonstrate the functionality, test and validate the proposed architectures using QCADesigner simulator.

Such models assist in comparing and evaluating methods and new technologies, provide transparency and foster the development of new applications. Interestingly, strong similarities between two separate projects focusing on specific forensic science areas were recently observed. These observations have led to the induction of a general model (Part I) that could guide the use of any forensic science case data in an intelligence perspective. The present article builds upon this general approach by focusing on decisional and organisational issues. The article investigates the comparison process and evaluation system that lay at the heart of the forensic intelligence framework, advocating scientific decision criteria and a structured but flexible and dynamic architecture. These building blocks are crucial and clearly lay within the expertise of forensic scientists. However, it is only part of the problem. Forensic intelligence includes other blocks with their respective interactions, decision points and tensions (e.g. regarding how to guide detection and how to integrate forensic information with other information). Formalising these blocks identifies many questions and potential answers. Addressing these questions is essential for the progress of the discipline. Such a process requires clarifying the role and place of the forensic scientist within the whole process and their relationship to other stakeholders. © 2015.","Comparison process; Forensic science; Integration; Model; Organisation and decisions","Ribaux, O., Baylon, A., Lock, E., Delémont, O., Roux, C., Zingg, C., Margot, P., Intelligence-led crime scene processing.

One of the main factors that help achieve this success is reputation systems that enable OSN users to mutually establish trust relationships based on their past experience. Current approaches for the reputation management cannot achieve the fine granularity and verifiability for each individual user, in the sense that the reputation values on such OSNs are coarse and lack of credibility. In this paper, we propose a fine granularity attribute-based reputation system which enables users to rate each other’s attributes instead of identities. Our scheme first verifies each OSN user’s attributes, and further allows OSN users to vote on the posted attribute-associated messages to derive the reputation value. The attribute verification process provides the authenticity of the reputation value without revealing the actual value to entities who do not have the vote privilege. To predict a stranger’s behavior, we propose a reputation retrieval protocol for querying the reputation value on a specific attribute. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to define a fine-grained reputation value based on users’ verified attributes in OSNs with privacy preservation. We provide the security analysis along with the simulation results to verify the privacy preservation and feasibility. The implementation of the proposed scheme on current OSNs is also discussed. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","attribute; authentication; privacy; reputation","Jøsang, A., Ismail, R., Boyd, C., A survey of trust and reputation systems for online service provision (2007) Decision Support Systems, 43 (2), pp. 618-644; Cho, J.H., Swami, A., Chen, I.R., A survey on trust management for mobile ad hoc networks (2011) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 13 (4), pp. 562-583; Sun, Y., Yu, W., Han, Z., Information theoretic framework of trust modeling and evaluation for ad hoc networks (2006) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 24 (2), pp. 305-317; Theodorakopoulos, G., Baras, J., On trust models and trust evaluation metrics for ad hoc networks (2006) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 24 (2), pp. 318-328; Guo L, Zhu X, Zhang C et al.

However, the use of DBM powder is limited due to the difficulties in handling, the tendency to migrate from graft sites and the lack of stability after surgery. In this study, a mechanically stable, salt-leached porous silk fibroin carrier was used to improve the handling properties of DBM powder and to support the attachment, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs). The DBM-silk fibroin (DBM/SF) scaffolds were fabricated with different contents of DBM powder (0%, 10%, 20%, 40% and 80% DBM/SF scaffolds). It was found that the DBM/SF scaffolds could form a stable composite preventing the migration of DBM powder. Moreover, the microarchitecture and mechanical properties of the scaffolds were influenced by the DBM powder. rBMSCs were seeded on the DBM/SF scaffolds and cultured for 14 days. Cell proliferation assays and cell morphology observations indicated that 20% DBM/SF scaffolds exhibited good cell attachment and proliferation. In addition, compared with the other groups, the cellular function was more actively exhibited on 20% DBM/SF scaffolds, as evident by the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis for osteoblast-related gene markers (e.g. COL1A1, ALP and cbfa1), the immunocytochemical evaluations of osteoblast-related extracellular matrix components (e.g. COL1A1, OCN and ONN) and the ALP activities. All the data suggested that DBM powder could be delivered using a silk fibroin carrier with improved handling characteristics and that 20% DBM/SF scaffolds had great potential as osteogenesis promoting scaffolds for successful applications in bone regeneration. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Vacanti, J.P., Langer, R., (1999) Lancet, 354, pp. SI32-SI34; Urist, M.R., (1965) Science, 150, pp. 893-899; Sawkins, M.J., Bowen, W., Dhadda, P., Markides, H., Sidney, L.E., Taylor, A.J., Rose, F.R., White, L.J., (2013) Acta Biomater., 9, pp. 7865-7873; Holt, D.J., Grainger, D.W., (2012) Adv.

An identity-based protocol is preferred to that under the employment of traditional public key infrastructure (PKI), since identity-based cryptosystem can simplify public key management procedure. In ASIACCS 2011, a security model for GKE protocol called EGBG model was proposed. The EGBG model takes ephemeral secret key leakage attack into consideration. Until now, there is no ID-based GKE protocol secure in the EGBG model. In this paper, we propose an identity-based GKE protocol. Its AKE-security with KCIR and full forward secrecy, MA-security with KCIR and its contributiveness are proven in the EGBG model. The proposed protocol does not involve NAXOS trick, which does not resist side channel attack and thus it provides stronger security guarantee. It achieves mutual authentication without applying signature, which makes the protocol more practical. © 2015 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","group key exchange; identity-based cryptography; insider security; provable security",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928640525

These smart and cheap devices provide the practical solutions for improving the public safety and homeland security with the capability of understanding the human behaviour automatically. In this sense, an intelligent video surveillance system should not be constrained on a person viewpoint, as in natural, a person is not restricted to perform an action from a fixed camera viewpoint. To achieve the objective, many state-of-the-art approaches require the information from multiple cameras in their processing. This is an impractical solution by considering its feasibility and computational complexity. First, it is very difficult to find an open space in real environment with perfect overlapping for multi-camera calibration. Secondly, the processing of information from multiple cameras is computational burden. With this, a surge of interest has sparked on single camera approach with notable work on the concept of view specific action recognition. However in their work, the viewpoints are assumed in a priori. In this paper, we extend it by proposing a viewpoint estimation framework where a novel human contour descriptor namely the fuzzy qualitative human contour is extracted from the fuzzy qualitative Poisson human model for viewpoint analysis. Clustering algorithms are used to learn and classify the viewpoints. In addition, our system is also integrated with the capability to classify front and rear views. Experimental results showed the reliability and effectiveness of our proposed viewpoint estimation framework by using the challenging IXMAS human action dataset. © 2015 The Natural Computing Applications Forum","Computer vision; Fuzzy qualitative reasoning; Human motion analysis; Video surveillance system",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928329092

However, such integration gives rise to a number of challenges. In this paper, an efficient framework which has considered six main challenges encountered in the MANET–Internet integration is proposed. An adaptive distributed multipath internet gateways discovery protocol is proposed, where the gateways advertise their information dynamically to an adaptive limited number of mobile nodes. For mobile nodes that cannot receive this information, an efficient dynamic routing algorithm for MANETs–Internet integration derived from the ant colony optimization algorithms is proposed. In addition, an improved Quality of Services based gateway selection mechanism providing load-balancing is proposed. The simulation study confirms that the proposed framework is scalable and able to cope with changes on the number and mobility of active sources connecting to the Internet and outperforms other conventional approaches in terms of end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio while attaining acceptable overhead and fair load distribution among all gateways. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Ant colony optimization; Gateway discovery; Load balancing; MANET–Internet integration; QoS",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928337238

It was adopted by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) as a technical standard. However, the DAA scheme in TCG specifications is designed for the single trusted domain attestation, and cannot be deployed in different trusted domain directly. It limits its application range in mobile networks, cloud computing, Internet of Things networks when users and authentication servers belong to different domains. Based on delegation of the trusted relationship, a new cross trusted domain direct anonymous attestation scheme is proposed in this paper. The proxy signature is used for trusted relationship delegation among different domains, and the DAA method is used for the computation platform authentication when a trusted platform accessing different trusted domains. Then the authentication protocol is designed and analyzed under Canetti-Krawczyk (CK) model for the platform remote attestation. The further analysis shows that our proposal can resist platform masquerade attacks and replay attacks, and the authentication protocol is provably secure. The security of the DAA remote attestation system is enhanced by the session key agreement. Finally, a prototype implementation and some experiments are given, the results show that the proposed scheme is effective and suitable for cross domain applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cross trusted domain; DAA; Delegation; Remote attestation; Trusted computing","(2007) Trusted Computing Group, TCG Specification Architecture Overview, , http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org; (2001) Trusted Computing Group, Trusted Computing Platform Alliance (TCPA), , http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org, main specification version 1.1b; Brickell, E., Camenisch, J., Chen, L., Direct anonymous attestation (2004) Proceedings of the 11th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 132-145; Perkins, C., (1996) IP Mobility Support, RFC 2002, , http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2002.txt; Mambo, M., Usuda, K., Okamoto, E., Proxy signatures for delegating signing operation (1996) Proceedings of the 3rd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 48-57; Camenisch, J., Michels, M., A Group Signature Scheme Based on an RSA-Variants (1998) Technical Report, RS-98-27, , University of Aarhus; Ge, H., Tate, S., A direct anonymous attestation scheme for embedded devices (2007) Public Key Cryptography (PKC'07), pp. 16-30; Bellare, M., Canetti, R., Krawczyk, H., A modular approach to the design and analysis of authentication and key exchange protocols (1998) Proceedings of the 30th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 419-428; Camenisch, J., Lysyanskaya, A., Dynamic accumulators and application to efficient revocation of anonymous credentials (2002) Advances in Cryptology (CRYPTO'02), pp. 61-76; Camenisch, J., Stadler, M., Efficient group signature schemes for large groups (1997) Advances in Cryptology (CRYPTO'97), pp. 410-424; Brickell, E., Chen, L., Li, J., Simplified security notions of direct anonymous attestation and a concrete scheme from pairings (2009) Int.

Meanwhile, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is gaining popularity in enterprise networks for flexibility in network management service and reduced operational cost. There seems a trend for the two technologies to go hand-in-hand in providing an enterprise's IT services. However, the new challenges brought by the marriage of cloud computing and SDN, particularly the implications on enterprise network security, have not been well understood. This paper sets to address this important problem. We start by examining the security impact, in particular, the impact on DDoS attack defense mechanisms, in an enterprise network where both technologies are adopted. We find that SDN technology can actually help enterprises to defend against DDoS attacks if the defense architecture is designed properly. To that end, we propose a DDoS attack mitigation architecture that integrates a highly programmable network monitoring to enable attack detection and a flexible control structure to allow fast and specific attack reaction. To cope with the new architecture, we propose a graphic model based attack detection system that can deal with the dataset shift problem. The simulation results show that our architecture can effectively and efficiently address the security challenges brought by the new network paradigm and our attack detection system can effectively report various attacks using real-world network traffic. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We describe in this article the development of a parallel cellular automata algorithm used in the three-dimensional simulation of multicellular tissue growth. Computational models of this genre are becoming ever more important because they provide an alternative approach to continuous models and an ability to describe the dynamics of complex biological systems evolving in time. We report on the different components of the model where cellular automata is used to model different types of cell populations that execute persistent random walks on the computational grid, collide, aggregate, and proliferate until they reach confluence. We elaborate on the main issues encountered in the parallelization of the algorithm as well as its implementation on a parallel machine with a particular focus on maintaining determinism. By delaying the exchange of cells in the shared boundaries between neighboring processors till after all events related to cell division and motion are accounted for in a given time step, good parallel performance results are obtained on a high-performance cluster. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","3-D simulation model; Cellular automata; Cluster machine; Determinism; Multicellular tissue growth; Parallel algorithm; Performance sweet spot",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928155057

The application enables a small set of neighbouring cellular/Wi-Fi devices to increase the quality of video playback by using the Wi-Fi network to share the portion of the live stream downloaded by each peer via the cellular network. The application exploits the main functionalities of ICN: routing by name, in network caching and multicast delivery.

This paper focuses on the decision problem about how to offload computation-intensive applications in mobile ad hoc network-based cloud computing environments. A set of online and batch scheduling heuristics were proposed to offload dynamically arriving independent tasks among mobile nodes. The heuristics were validated in a simulation environment, and their performances with respect to both user-centric and system-centric metrics such as the average makespan, the average waiting time, the average slowdown and the average utilization, were investigated with comprehensive experiments. Experimental results show that it is not appropriate to map tasks only based on the expected bandwidth, execution time or the overall offloading time, On the contrary, the expected completion time must be taken into account. Furthermore, the MCTComm heuristic seems to be the best choice from the standpoint of the tradeoff between the complexity and the performance. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Batch scheduling; Computation offloading; Cyber foraging; Mobile cloud computing; Online scheduling",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928155316

However, many people share their login patterns with coworkers and request these coworkers to assist co-tasks, thereby making the pattern as one of the weakest points of computer security. Insider attackers, the valid users of a system who attack the system internally, are hard to detect since most intrusion detection systems and firewalls identify and isolate malicious behaviors launched from the outside world of the system only. In addition, some studies claimed that analyzing system calls (SCs) generated by commands can identify these commands, with which to accurately detect attacks, and attack patterns are the features of an attack. Therefore, in this paper, a security system, named the Internal Intrusion Detection and Protection System (IIDPS), is proposed to detect insider attacks at SC level by using data mining and forensic techniques. The IIDPS creates users' personal profiles to keep track of users' usage habits as their forensic features and determines whether a valid login user is the account holder or not by comparing his/her current computer usage behaviors with the patterns collected in the account holder's personal profile. The experimental results demonstrate that the IIDPS's user identification accuracy is 94.29%, whereas the response time is less than 0.45 s, implying that it can prevent a protected system from insider attacks effectively and efficiently.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928252912

An interesting, preliminary result is that classifier security to evasion may be even worsened by the application of feature selection. In this paper, we provide a more detailed investigation of this aspect, shedding some light on the security properties of feature selection against evasion attacks. Inspired by previous work on adversary-aware classifiers, we propose a novel adversary-aware feature selection model that can improve classifier security against evasion attacks, by incorporating specific assumptions on the adversary's data manipulation strategy.

In this study, a method was proposed to formulate crowd behavior with the cell automata and multi-agent models, which were successfully mapped onto the MapReduce programming model. A simulation framework was developed upon Hadoop to simulate large crowd scenarios over a cluster. The simulation process was then transformed to a series of parallel operations on data streams. The simulation studies on a large-scale evacuation scenario had indicated that the simulation framework ensured the simulation process’ logic correctness.

In this paper, we present two fuzzy-based systems (called FBRS1 and FBRS2) to improve the reliability of JXTA-overlay P2P platform. In FBRS1, we considered three input parameters: number of interactions (NI), security (S), packet loss (PL) to decide the peer reliability (PR). In FBRS2, we considered four input parameters: NI, S, PL and local score to decide the PR. We compare the proposed systems by computer simulations. Comparing the complexity of FBRS1 and FBRS2, the FBRS2 is more complex than FBRS1. However, it also considers the local score, which makes it more reliable than FBRS1. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Fuzzy system; JXTA-overlay platform; Local score; Number of interactions; P2P; Reliability; Security",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928139571

The UMTS-AKA provides mutual authentication, but is still vulnerable to redirection attack, denial of service attack, and man-in-the-middle attack. Apart from various attacks possibilities, the UMTS-AKA has a problem of counter synchronization, generates huge overhead, and utilizes more bandwidth and message exchanges during the authentication. An intruder may apply these attacks to impersonate the network or mischarge the mobile users. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure AKA protocol namely ES-AKA to prevent the UMTS network against these problems and attacks. This protocol also solves the synchronization problem occurred between a mobile station MS and its home network HLR. The ES-AKA protocol generates lesser communication overhead as compared to UMTS-AKA, EXT-AKA, COCKTAIL-AKA, SKA-AKA, AP-AKA, X-AKA, EURASIP-AKA, Full-AKA, and U-AKA protocols. In addition, it also generates less computation overhead than the UMTS-AKA, EXT-AKA, COCKTAIL-AKA, S-AKA, Full-AKA, and U-AKA protocols. On an average, the ES-AKA protocol reduces 62 % of the bandwidth, which is the maximum reduction of the bandwidth by any AKA protocol referred in the paper. This protocol is also able to reduce 6 % of the messages exchanged (in terms of computations) during the authentication in comparison to UMTS-AKA. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Authentication; DoS; Man-in-the-middle; Redirection; UMTS",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928138799

Due to the low sensitivity of PIN receiver and the lack of APD above 10 Gb/s, optical preamplification is a promising concept for high-speed receiver. We demonstrate an SOA-PIN/TIA receiver module which integrates an SOA-PIN photonic circuit and a TIA. This receiver has a large responsivity of 44 A/W, a polarization dependence below 2 dB, a low noise figure of 8.5 dB and a large 3-dB bandwidth of 35 GHz.

The associated increase in demand for land, water resources, and rich foods will deepen the challenge of sustainably feeding the population and balancing agricultural and environmental policies. We combine a hydrologic model with an economic model to project China's future food trade patterns and embedded water resources by 2030 and to analyze the effects of targeted irrigation reductions on this system, notably on national agricultural water consumption and food self-sufficiency. We simulate interprovincial and international food trade with a general equilibrium welfare model and a linear programming optimization, and we obtain province-level estimates of commodities' virtual water content with a hydrologic model. We find that reducing irrigated land in regions highly dependent on scarce river flow and nonrenewable groundwater resources, such as Inner Mongolia and the greater Beijing area, can improve the efficiency of agriculture and trade regarding water resources. It can also avoid significant consumption of irrigation water across China (up to 14.8 km3/y, reduction by 14%), while incurring relatively small decreases in national food self-sufficiency (e.g., by 3% for wheat). Other researchers found that a national, rather than local, water policywould have similar effects on food production but would only reduce irrigation water consumption by 5%. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

In particular, we study how the distribution of ligands on the nanoparticle surface influences the uptake rate. The speed of membrane wrapping and uptake was found to be the fastest for nanoparticles with homogeneous ligand distributions, where ligands are spread evenly on the surface. We show that the diffusion of the ligands on the nanoparticle can hinder its uptake, since upon the interaction with the membrane the ligand distribution becomes extremely inhomogeneous, with a large ligand-free patch.

We use computer simulations to test the consequences of different hypotheses of the mechanoregulation at the cellular level on the patterns of tissues formed during healing. The computational study is based on an experiment on sheep, where after a tibial osteotomy, histological sections were harvested at different time points. In the simulations, we used a recently proposed basic phenomenological model, which allows ossification to occur either via endochondral or intramembranous ossification, but tries otherwise to employ a minimal number of simulation parameters. The model was extended to consider also the possibility of bone resorption and consequently allowing a description of the full healing progression till the restoration of the cortex. Specifically, we investigated how three changes in the mechanoregulation influence the resulting tissue patterns: (1) a time delay between stimulation of the cell and the formation of the tissue, (2) a variable mechanosensitivity of the cells, and (3) an independence of long time intervals of the soft tissue maturation from the mechanical stimulus. For all three scenarios, our simulations do not show qualitative differences in the time development of the tissue patterns. Largest differences were observed in the intermediate phases of healing in the amount and location of the cartilage. Interestingly, the course of healing was virtually unaltered in case of scenario (3) where tissue maturation proceeded independent of mechanical stimulation. © 2015 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering","Bone healing; Cell sensitivity; Mechanical stimulus; Simulation; Tissue differentiation",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927544487

However, despite the huge potential gains that can be achieved, security represents a fundamental issue, which prevents the massive cloud adoption in mission-critical Information Technology sectors. The most common security issues are amplified in the cloud environment since new complex features, with their inherent weaknesses, enter into the problem space, particularly those associated to multitenancy and elasticity. Thus, new threats, such as the energy-related denial-of-service attacks against large-scale cloud infrastructures, may involve not only the quality of the delivered services but also their operational costs in terms of energy bill. The longer is the time necessary to identify such attacks, the heavier is the impact on the overall energy consumption and, consequently, on the associated expenses. This work presents a detailed analysis of such new sophisticated menaces, by focusing on those that are specifically tailored to originate the worst-case energy demands by leveraging properly crafted low-rate traffic patterns in order to ensure stealth operations. We present some strategies exploiting the cloud flexibility in order to increase in a fraudulent way the overall energy consumption and analyze their impact within large-scale cloud infrastructures. This should help cloud providers in understanding such weaknesses and highlighting their root causes, as well as in providing some hints on how they can counter these subtle security issues.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927546658

Since Shor's quantum algorithm appeared, the security of most of the classical cryptographic schemes has been compromised, as they rely on the fact that factoring is infeasible. To overcome this, quantum mechanics has been used intensively in the past decades, and alternatives resistant to quantum attacks have been developed in order to fulfill the (potential) lack of security of a significant number of classical schemes. In this paper, we present a quantum computationally secure protocol for bit-string oblivious transfer between two parties, under the assumption of quantum hardness of state distinguishability and the constraint of performing at most few-qubit measurements (leaving open the question of general attacks performed on all qubits involved). The protocol is feasible, in the sense that it is implementable in polynomial time. © 2015 American Physical Society.",,"Crépeau, C., (1987) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 350-354. , CRYPTO (Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg); Rabin, M.O., IACR Eprint Archive, p. 12955. , Harvard University Technical Report, talr@watson.ibm.com received 21 Jun 2005; Even, S., Goldreich, O., Lempel, A., (1985) Commun.

Despite many research efforts in recent years, it remains a challenging task to design an efficient SCA-WSN scheme that achieves user anonymity. The majority of published SCA-WSN schemes use only lightweight cryptographic techniques (rather than public-key cryptographic techniques) for the sake of efficiency, and have been demonstrated to suffer from the inability to provide user anonymity. Some schemes employ elliptic curve cryptography for better security but require sensors with strict resource constraints to perform computationally expensive scalar-point multiplications; despite the increased computational requirements, these schemes do not provide user anonymity. In this paper, we present a new SCA-WSN scheme that not only achieves user anonymity but also is efficient in terms of the computation loads for sensors. Our scheme employs elliptic curve cryptography but restricts its use only to anonymous user-to-gateway authentication, thereby allowing sensors to perform only lightweight cryptographic operations. Our scheme also enjoys provable security in a formal model extended from the widely accepted Bellare-Pointcheval-Rogaway (2000) model to capture the user anonymity property and various SCA-WSN specific attacks (e.g., stolen smart card attacks, node capture attacks, privileged insider attacks, and stolen verifier attacks). © 2015 Nam et al.",,"Rawat, P., Singh, K., Chaouchi, H., Bonnin, J., Wireless sensor networks: A survey on recent developments and potential synergies (2014) The Journal of Supercomputing, 68, pp. 1-48;

Unfortunately, it was conceived without any internal security mechanism, and hence is prone to a number of vulnerabilities and attacks that can result in large scale outages in the Internet. In light of this, securing BGP has been an active research area since its adoption. Several security strategies, ranging from a complete replacement of the protocol up to the addition of new features in it were proposed, but only minor tweaks have found the pathway to be adopted. More recently, the IETF Secure Inter-Domain Routing (SIDR) Working Group (WG) has put forward several recommendations to secure BGP. In this paper, we survey the efforts of the SIDR WG including, the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs), and BGP Security (BGPSEC), for securing the BGP protocol. We also discuss the post SIDR inter-domain routing unresolved security challenges along with the deployment and adoption challenges of SIDR's proposals. Furthermore, we shed light on future research directions in managing the broader security issues in inter-domain routing. The paper is targeted to readers from the academic and industrial communities that are not only interested in an updated article accounting for the recent developments made by the Internet standardization body toward securing BGP (i.e., by the IETF), but also for an analytical discussion about their pros and cons, including promising research lines as well. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.","BGP; BGPSEC; Inter-domain; Internet; Routing; Security","Rekhter, Y., Li, T., Hares, S., A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4), p. 2006. , RFC 4271, IETF; Pei, D., Azuma, M., Massey, D., Zhang, L., BGP-RCN: Improving bgp convergence through root cause notification (2005) Comput.

Mammogram is one of the most effective tools for early detection of the breast cancer. Various computer-aided systems have been introduced to detect the breast cancer from mammogram images. In a computer-aided diagnosis system, detection and segmentation of breast masses from the background tissues is an important issue. In this paper, an automatic segmentation method is proposed to identify and segment the suspicious mass regions of mammogram using a modified transition rule named maximal cell strength updation in cellular automata (CA). In coarse-level segmentation, the proposed method performs an adaptive global thresholding based on the histogram peak analysis to obtain the rough region of interest. An automatic seed point selection is proposed using gray-level co-occurrence matrix-based sum average feature in the coarse segmented image. Finally, the method utilizes CA with the identified initial seed point and the modified transition rule to segment the mass region. The proposed approach is evaluated over the dataset of 70 mammograms with mass from mini-MIAS database. Experimental results show that the proposed approach yields promising results to segment the mass region in the mammograms with the sensitivity of 92.25 % and accuracy of 93.48 %. © 2015 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering","Cellular automata; GLCM; Histogram peak analysis; Mammogram segmentation; Seed selection",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926360200

Network attackers, or Botmasters, use Botnet to launch the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) to paralyze large-scale websites or steal confidential data from infected computers. They also employ ""phishing"" attacks to steal sensitive information (such as users' accounts and passwords), send bulk email advertising, and/or conduct click fraud. Even though detection technology has been much improved and some solutions to Internet security have been proposed and improved, the threat of Botnet still exists. Most of the past studies dealing with this issue used either packet contents or traffic flow characteristics to identify the invasion of Botnet. However, there still exist many problems in the areas of packet encryption and data privacy, simply because Botnet can easily change the packet contents and flow characteristics to circumvent the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This study combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and K-means algorithms to provide a solution to remedy those problems and develop, step by step, a mechanism for Botnet detection. First, three important network behaviors are identified: long active communication behavior (ActBehavior), connection failure behavior (FailBehavior), and network scanning behavior (ScanBehavior). These behaviors are defined according to the relevant prior studies and used to analyze the communication activities among the infected computers. Second, the features of network behaviors are extracted from the flow traces in the network layer and transport layer of the network equipment. Third, PSO and K-means techniques are used to uncover the host members of Botnet in the organizational network. This study mainly utilizes the flow traces of a campus network as an experiment. The experimental findings show that this proposed approach can be employed to detect the suspicious Botnet members earlier than the detection application systems. In addition, this proposed approach is easy to implement and can be further used and extended in the campus dormitory network, home networks, and the mobile 3G network. © 2015 ACM.","Botnet; K-means clustering; Network traffic analysis; Particle swarm optimization","Acohido, B., Swartz, J., (2009) Hacker Attack Takes Down Twitter, Facebook LiveJournal, , http://www.usatoday.com, Retrieved from; Ahmadyfard, A., Modares, H., Combining PSO and k-means to enhance data clustering (2008) Proceedings of the 2008 International Symposium on Telecommunications (IST'08)., pp. 688-691; Al-Hammadi, Y., Aickelin, U., Greensmith, J., DCA for bot detection (2008) Proceedings of the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI'08); Van Den Bergh, F., Engelbrecht, A.P., A study of particle swarm optimization particle trajectories (2006) Information Sciences, 176 (8), pp. 937-971; Benson Edwin Raj, S., Shalini, R., A novel approach for the early detection and identification of botnets (2012) Advanced Materials Research, 403, pp. 4469-4475; Brownlee, N., Mills, C., Ruth, G., Traffic flow measurement: Architecture (1999) IETF.

The different organizations can maintain their own cloud environment while exchanging healthcare data among them in a peer-to-peer(P2P) fashion according to some defined polices. However, there are many security and privacy challenges that hamper the adoption of cloud computing solutions in healthcare domain. Besides, due to the privacy sensitivity of healthcare data, an organization may not wish to disclose its identity to others when exchanging data in the network to avoid different attacks by the intruders. Hence, anonymously authenticated data exchange is essential between the different peer organizations. In this paper we propose an anonymous on-the-fly secure data exchange protocol for such environment based on pairing-based cryptography. Our proposed solution allows cloud peers to dynamically generate temporary identities that are used to produce a session key for each session of data exchange. The proposed protocol is robust against different attacks, such as target-oriented, man-in-the middle, masquerade, and message manipulation attacks. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Anonymous authentication; P2P cloud; Pairing-based cryptography; Secure data exchange; Security attacks",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926228065

The main benefit of cloud computing is that this technology decreases computing costs and infrastructures, allowing much more efficient computing. Through a portal, users submit working tasks and receive the results without assigning to specific servers. Nevertheless, the computers of users and enterprises are located in cloud, and arbitrary clients can randomly log on and take private data away. Thus, the cloud security becomes a significant subject. In this paper, we exploit the threshold crypto sharing (Desmedt and Frankel in Advances in cryptology—CRYPTO’89, 1990) with group signature mechanism to secure transmitted data. During map and reduce phases, this mechanism can protect the divided and merged messages from being tampered with. Additionally, this study exploits a virtual machine platform to simulate cloud computing environments and then perform security operations. Experimental results show that the mechanism presented has lower cost comparing to other existing ones and very promising its application in cloud environments. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Cloud security; Group signature; Map; Reduce; Threshold crypto sharing; Virtual machine",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926157263

Mobile nodes in MANETs tend to broadcast packets to exchange information and consume lots of network resources such as network bandwidth and battery power of each node during forwarding their packets. Hence, the conserving network resource is crucial to maintain the quality of network services without interruptions. In order to discover an ideal routing algorithm that should use minimum network resources and improve network performance, we propose an adaptive-gossiping routing algorithm that saves network bandwidth and energy consumption at each node by reducing the duplicated routing messages. Our new analytical model of adaptive-gossiping probability (Formula presented.) provides a less routing overhead which results in conserving network resources and reducing the end-to-end delay. The both analytical and experimental results of our proposed method confirm its advantages over flooding and static-gossiping based routing protocols in large-scale networks. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Adaptive-gossiping; Mobile ad hoc wireless networks; Modeling and performance evaluations; Network resource saving; Routing protocols",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926191476

They play important roles in supporting fundamental cellular processes such as cell division, signaling, locomotion, and intracellular transport. In cells, cytoskeleton proteins function under nonequilibrium conditions that are powered by hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or guanosine triphosphate (GTP) molecules attached to them. Although these biopolymers are critically important for all cellular processes, the mechanisms that govern their complex dynamics and force generation remain not well explained. One of the most difficult fundamental issues is to understand how different components of cytoskeleton proteins interact together. We develop an approximate theoretical approach for analyzing complex processes in cytoskeleton proteins that takes into account the multifilament structure, lateral interactions between parallel protofilaments, and the most relevant biochemical transitions during the biopolymer growth. It allows us to fully evaluate collective dynamic properties of cytoskeleton filaments as well as the effect of external forces on them. It is found that for the case of strong lateral interactions the stall force of the multifilament protein is a linear function of the number of protofilaments. However, for weak lateral interactions, deviations from the linearity are observed. We also show that stall forces, mean velocities, and dispersions are increasing functions of the lateral interactions. Physical-chemical explanations of these phenomena are presented. Our theoretical predictions are supported by extensive Monte Carlo computer simulations.

On one hand, the proliferation of user terminals such as smartphones, tablets, notebooks, smart TVs, game consoles, and desktop computers makes it extremely difficult to achieve the same level of protection regardless of the device used. On the other hand, when various users share devices (e.g., parents and kids using the same devices at home), the setup of distinct security profiles, policies, and protection rules for the different users of a terminal is far from trivial. In light of this, this article advocates for a paradigm shift in user protection. In our model, protection is decoupled from users' terminals, and it is provided by the access network through a trusted virtual domain. Each trusted virtual domain provides unified and homogeneous security for a single user irrespective of the terminal employed. We describe a user-centric model where nontechnically savvy users can define their own profiles and protection rules in an intuitive way. We show that our model can harness the virtualization power offered by next-generation access networks, especially from network functions virtualization in the points of presence at the edge of telecom operators. We also analyze the distinctive features of our model, and the challenges faced based on the experience gained in the development of a proof of concept. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",,"(2014) Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV) Architectural Framework, , http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV/001_099/002/01.02.01_60/gs_NFV002v010201p.pdf, December; Sherry, J., Making Middleboxes Someone Else's Problem: Network Processing as a Cloud Service Proc.

Data sharing with a large number of participants must take into account several issues, including efficiency, data integrity and privacy of data owner. Ring signature is a promising candidate to construct an anonymous and authentic data sharing system. It allows a data owner to anonymously authenticate his data which can be put into the cloud for storage or analysis purpose. Yet the costly certificate verification in the traditional public key infrastructure (PKI) setting becomes a bottleneck for this solution to be scalable. Identity-based (ID-based) ring signature, which eliminates the process of certificate verification, can be used instead. In this paper, we further enhance the security of ID-based ring signature by providing forward security: If a secret key of any user has been compromised, all previous generated signatures that include this user still remain valid. This property is especially important to any large scale data sharing system, as it is impossible to ask all data owners to re-authenticate their data even if a secret key of one single user has been compromised. We provide a concrete and efficient instantiation of our scheme, prove its security and provide an implementation to show its practicality. © 2015 IEEE.","Authentication; cloud computing; data sharing; forward security; smart grid","Abe, M., Ohkubo, M., Suzuki, K., 1-out-of-n signatures from a variety of keys (2002) Proc. 8th Int.

Lattice-based cryptography is one of the important candidates because of its reasonable complexity combined with reasonable signature sizes. However, in a postquantum world, not only the cryptography will change but also the computing platforms. Large amounts of resource-constrained embedded systems will connect to a cloud of powerful server computers. We present an optimization technique for lattice-based signature generation on such embedded systems; our goal is to optimize latency rather than throughput. Indeed, on an embedded system, the latency of a single signature for user identification or message authentication is more important than the aggregate signature generation rate. We builda high-performance implementation using hardware/software codesign techniques. The key idea is to partition the signature generation scheme into offline and online phases. The signature scheme allows this separation because a large portion of the computation does not depend on the message to be signed and can be handled before the message is given. Then, we can map complex precomputation operations in software on a low-cost processor and utilize hardware resources to accelerate simpler online operations. To find the optimum hardware architecture for the target platform, we define and explore the design space and implement two design configurations. We realize our solutions on the Altera Cyclone-IV CGX150 FPGA. The implementation consists of a NIOS soft-core processor and a low-latency hash and polynomial multiplication engine. On average, the proposed low-latency architecture can generate a signature with a latency of 96 clock cycles at 40MHz, resulting in a response time of 2.4μs for a signing request. On equivalent platforms, this corresponds to a performance improvement of 33 and 105 times compared to previous hardware and software implementations, respectively. © 2015 ACM.","Digital signatures; FPGA; Hardware/software codesign; Lattice-based cryptography","Aysu, A., Patterson, C., Schaumont, P., Low-cost and area-efficient FPGA implementations of lattice-based cryptography (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST'13), pp. 81-86. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HST.2013.6581570; (2013) Statistical Summary of Commercial Jet Airplane Accidents, , http://www.boeing.com/news/techissues/pdf/statsum.pdf, Retrieved from; Bogdanov, A., Eisenbarth, T., Rupp, A., Wolf, C., Time-area optimized public-key engines: MQ-cryptosystems as replacement for elliptic curves?

For understanding the threat to security and privacy, it is important for security researchers to analyze malicious software written for these systems. The exploding number of Android malware calls for automation in the analysis. In this paper, we present Mobile-Sandbox, a system designed to automatically analyze Android applications in novel ways: First, it combines static and dynamic analysis, i.e., results of static analysis are used to guide dynamic analysis and extend coverage of executed code. Additionally, it uses specific techniques to log calls to native (i.e., “non-Java”) APIs, and last but not least it combines these results with machine-learning techniques to cluster the analyzed samples into benign and malicious ones. We evaluated the system on more than 69,000 applications from Asian third-party mobile markets and found that about 21 % of them actually use native calls in their code. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Android; Automated analysis; Machine learning; Malware","Aafer, Y., Du, W., Yin, H., DroidAPIMiner: Mining API-level features for robust malware detection in android (2013) Proc. of International Conference on Security and Privacy in Communication Networks (SecureComm); https://developer.android.com/guide/developing/devices/emulator.html, Android Developers.: Using the Android emulator.

Applications include network modeling and simulation, identification of security attacks, and validation of research results. Unfortunately, network flows carry extremely sensitive information, and this discourages the publication of those datasets. Indeed, existing techniques for network flow sanitization are vulnerable to different kinds of attacks, and solutions proposed for microdata anonymity cannot be directly applied to network traces. In our previous research, we proposed an obfuscation technique for network flows, providing formal confidentiality guarantees under realistic assumptions about the adversary's knowledge. In this paper, we identify the threats posed by the incremental release of network flows, we propose a novel defense algorithm, and we formally prove the achieved confidentiality guarantees. An extensive experimental evaluation of the algorithm for incremental obfuscation, carried out with billions of real Internet flows, shows that our obfuscation technique preserves the utility of flows for network traffic analysis. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Data sharing; network flow analysis; privacy; security","Brekne, T., Årnes, A., Circumventing IP-address pseudonymization (2005) Proc.

International crash data indicate that roadside characteristics contribute to more than half of all run-off-road injury crashes (RORIC) involving serious injury or death. Furthermore, roadside geometric characteristics are believed to be the leading cause of rollover in single-vehicle RORIC. Differences in each country's road network features, car vehicle stock, driving behavior, characteristics of roadside obstacles and economical aspects justify the need for evaluating the merit of specific approaches to roadside safety issues. Results from recent studies carried out at the Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil - LNEC have shown that important differences exist between RORIC in Portuguese roads, when they are compared with RORIC in roads from other countries. A framework was developed for assisting in cost-effective decisions as regards roadside safety interventions, which is based on results from the analysis of registered data and the observation of inservice performance of installed equipments on Portuguese roads. A brief description is provided of cost-benefit analysis software tools for safety evaluation and simulation of roadside scenarios, which were developed at LNEC under a dedicated research project - SAFESIDE-roadside safety. The software contains a list of roadside safety measures (including the present value of their implementation costs and their safety effects) and an accident categorization (based on predictive models for crash frequencies and crash costs). The software is being disseminated by road authorities and relevant technical stakeholders, within the current revision of Portuguese road design standards. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cost-benefit analysis; Crash modification factors; Crash prediction models; Roadside safety; Software","Roadside Design Guide (1998) American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.; SafetyAnalyst (2010) American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, , http://www.SafetyAnalyst.org, (accessed 25.08.14) (Internet); Highway Safety Manual.

On one hand, the capabilities of SDN make it easy to detect and to react to DDoS attacks. On the other hand, the separation of the control plane from the data plane of SDN introduces new attacks. Consequently, SDN itself may be a target of DDoS attacks. In this paper, we first discuss the new trends and characteristics of DDoS attacks in cloud computing environments. We show that SDN brings us a new chance to defeat DDoS attacks in cloud computing environments, and we summarize good features of SDN in defeating DDoS attacks. Then we review the studies about launching DDoS attacks on SDN and the methods against DDoS attacks in SDN. In addition, we discuss a number of challenges that need to be addressed to mitigate DDoS attached in SDN with cloud computing. This work can help understand how to make full use of SDN's advantages to defeat DDoS attacks in cloud computing environments and how to prevent SDN itself from becoming a victim of DDoS attacks. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",,"Xiao, Z., Xiao, Y., Security and Privacy in Cloud Computing (2013) IEEE Commun.

The efficiency of file querying suffers from the distinctive properties of such networks including node mobility and limited communication range and resource. An intuitive method to alleviate this problem is to create file replicas in the network. However, despite the efforts on file replication, no research has focused on the global optimal replica creation with minimum average querying delay. Specifically, current file replication protocols in mobile ad hoc networks have two shortcomings. First, they lack a rule to allocate limited resources to different files in order to minimize the average querying delay. Second, they simply consider storage as available resources for replicas, but neglect the fact that the file holders' frequency of meeting other nodes also plays an important role in determining file availability. Actually, a node that has a higher meeting frequency with others provides higher availability to its files. This becomes even more evident in sparsely distributed MANETs, in which nodes meet disruptively. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of resource for file replication, which considers both node storage and meeting frequency. We theoretically study the influence of resource allocation on the average querying delay and derive a resource allocation rule to minimize the average querying delay. We further propose a distributed file replication protocol to realize the proposed rule. Extensive trace-driven experiments with synthesized traces and real traces show that our protocol can achieve shorter average querying delay at a lower cost than current replication protocols. © 2015 IEEE.","file availability; file sharing; MANETs; peer-to-peer","(2014), http://qik.com/, Qik(2014), http://www.flixwagon.com/, FlixwagonPalazzi, C., Bujari, A., A delay/disruption tolerant solution for mobile to mobile file sharing (2010) Proc.

Beyond improving the computing infrastructure, cloud computing enables a higher level of interoperability between information systems, simplifying tasks such as sharing documents between coworkers or enabling collaboration between an organization and its suppliers. While these abilities may result in significant benefits to users and organizations, they also present privacy challenges due to unwanted exposure of sensitive information. As information-sharing processes in cloud computing are complex and domain specific, configuring these processes can be an overwhelming and burdensome task for users. This article investigates the feasibility of configuring sharing processes through a small and representative set of canonical configuration options. For this purpose, we present a generic method, named SCON-UP (Simplified CON-figuration of User Preferences). SCON-UP simplifies configuration interfaces by using a clustering algorithm that analyzes a massive set of sharing preferences and condenses them into a small number of discrete disclosure levels. Thus, the user is provided with a usable configuration model while guaranteeing adequate privacy control.We describe the algorithm and empirically evaluate our model using data collected in two user studies (n = 121 and n = 352). Our results show that when provided with three canonical configuration options, on average, 82% of the population can be covered by at least one option. We exemplify the feasibility of discretizing sharing levels and discuss the tradeoff between coverage and simplicity in discrete configuration options. © 2015 ACM.","Artificial intelligence (ai); Cloud computing; Data protection; Human-computer interaction; Information disclosure; Intelligent agents; Preference clustering; Privacy","Acquisti, A., Privacy in electronic commerce and the economics of immediate gratification (2004) Proceedings of the 5th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce, pp. 21-29. , ACM; Armbrust, M., Fox, A., Griffith, R., Joseph, A.D., Katz, R., Konwinski, A., Lee, G., Zaharia, M., (2009) Above the Clouds: A Berkeley View of Cloud Computing, , UC Berkeley Reliable Adaptive Distributed Systems Laboratory.

High-precision, stability, convergence, and lowest-possible memory requirements are ensured by the CNN processor architecture. A significant challenge solved in this paper is that all these cited computing features are ensured in all system-states (regular or chaotic ones) and in all bifurcation conditions that may be experienced by NDEs.One particular quintessence of this paper is to develop and demonstrate a solver concept that shows and ensures that CNN processors (realized either in hardware or in software) are universal solvers of NDE models. The solving logic or algorithm of given NDEs (possible examples are: Duffing, Mathieu, Van der Pol, Jerk, Chua, Rössler, Lorenz, Burgers, and the transport equations) through a CNN processor system is provided by a set of templates that are computed by our comprehensive templates calculation technique that we call nonlinear adaptive optimization. This paper is therefore a significant contribution and represents a cutting-edge real-time computational engineering approach, especially while considering the various scientific and engineering applications of this ultrafast, energy-and-memory-efficient, and high-precise NDE solver concept. For illustration purposes, three NDE models are demonstratively solved, and related CNN templates are derived and used: the periodically excited Duffing equation, the Mathieu equation, and the transport equation. © 2012 IEEE.","Cellular neural networks (CNNs)-based neurocomputing; CNN processor concept as a universal differential equation model solver; CNN-based ultrafast solving of nonlinear differential equations (NDEs); nonlinear adaptive optimization (NAOP)","Wiechert, W., The role of modeling in computational science education (2003) Future Generat.

Their guidelines on tool qualification favor a bottom-up approach in which tools are dealt with in isolation and mostly if they may directly introduce faults into end products. This guidance may ignore risk introduced by the integration of software tools, especially if these risks are related to low levels of automation - such as process notifications and improper graphical user interfaces.This paper presents a study that ties weaknesses in support environments to software faults. Based on the observed weaknesses guidelines for a top-down software tool chain qualification are suggested for inclusion in the next generation of safety standards. This has implications not only for the surveyed standards in the transportation domain, but also for other standards for safety-critical CPS development that do not include a broader view on risks related to tool usage.Furthermore, given the type of omission identified in the surveyed standards, it is suggested that researchers interested in the safety-related implications of tool integration should approach organizational research in search of possibilities to set up theory triangulation studies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Automation; Certification; Support environments; Tool integration; Tool qualification","Armengaud, E., Zoier, M., Baumgart, A., Biehl, M., Chen, D., Griessnig, G., Hein, C., Kolagari, R.T., Model-based toolchain for the efficient development of safety-relevant automotive embedded systems (2011), In: Proceedings of the SAE 2011 World Congress & Exhibition(2013), ITEA ARTEMIS-IA High-Level Vision 2030, Opportunities for Europe.

They are used for spamming, phishing, denial-of-service attacks, brute-force cracking, stealing private information, and cyber warfare. Botnets carry out network scans for several reasons, including searching for vulnerable machines to infect and recruit into the botnet, probing networks for enumeration or penetration, etc. We present the measurement and analysis of a horizontal scan of the entire IPv4 address space conducted by the Sality botnet in February 2011. This 12-day scan originated from approximately 3 million distinct IP addresses and used a heavily coordinated and unusually covert scanning strategy to try to discover and compromise VoIP-related (SIP server) infrastructure. We observed this event through the UCSD Network Telescope, a /8 darknet continuously receiving large amounts of unsolicited traffic, and we correlate this traffic data with other public sources of data to validate our inferences. Sality is one of the largest botnets ever identified by researchers. Its behavior represents ominous advances in the evolution of modern malware: the use of more sophisticated stealth scanning strategies by millions of coordinated bots, targeting critical voice communications infrastructure. This paper offers a detailed dissection of the botnet's scanning behavior, including general methods to correlate, visualize, and extrapolate botnet behavior across the global Internet. © 2014 IEEE.","Botnet; communication system security; darknet; Internet background radiation; Internet telephony; network probing; Network Telescope; scanning; VoIP","AfriNIC: The Registry of Internet Number Resources for Africa, , http://www.afrinic.net, Cybercity Ebene, Mauritius, [Online].

With the progress in computer vision, video-based surveillance systems have made great advances on traffic surveillance in ITSs. However, the performance of most existing surveillance systems is susceptible to challenging complex traffic scenes (e.g., object occlusion, pose variation, and cluttered background). Moreover, existing related research is mainly on a single video sensor node, which is incapable of addressing the surveillance of traffic road networks. Accordingly, we present a review of the literature on the video-based vehicle surveillance systems in ITSs. We analyze the existing challenges in video-based surveillance systems for the vehicle and present a general architecture for video surveillance systems, i.e., the hierarchical and networked vehicle surveillance, to survey the different existing and potential techniques. Then, different methods are reviewed and discussed with respect to each module. Applications and future developments are discussed to provide future needs of ITS services. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Behavior understanding; computer vision; networked surveillance system; traffic surveillance; vehicle detection; vehicle tracking","Buch, N., Velastin, S.A., Orwell, J., A review of computer vision techniques for the analysis of urban traffic (2011) IEEE Trans.

Yet, the interaction between the change detector and the Bayesian filter is typically designed heuristically. Differently, this paper develops a sound framework to model and implement a bidirectional communication flow between the two processes. In our Bayesian loop, change detection provides well-defined observation likelihood to the recursive filter and the filter prediction provides an informative prior to the change detector, which deploys Bayesian reasoning alike. The loop is developed for the two major variants of Bayesian filters used in tracking, namely the Kalman filter and the particle filter. Experiments on publicly available videos and a novel challenging data set show that the proposed interaction scheme outperforms several state-of-the-art trackers. © 2014 IEEE.","Image sequence analysis; Kalman filters; motion detection; particle filters real-time tracking; video surveillance; video tracking","Yilmaz, A., Javed, O., Shah, M., Object tracking: A survey (2006) ACM Comput.

Ten free maternal and child health apps available in Google and Apple stores were examined to evaluate their trustworthiness and technical performance. This was determined based on evidence of health professional involvement and use of evidence-based medical content, as well as an evaluation of functionality, usability and security. Only four of the ten apps examined were developed with the involvement of health professionals and four provided information from evidence-based medical content. Significantly, only four were fully functional, two were fully usable and three adequately implemented security mechanisms to guarantee privacy of user data. Two of the apps were inoperative. In conclusion, this study found great variation in the quality of content, functionality and security of ten maternal and child health apps. These results suggest developers, owners and health providers should work to improve maternal and child health apps, consumers need help to determine the trustworthiness of health apps, and sponsors and regulators should establish standards and endorse compliant health apps. © 2015, IUPESM and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Applications; Apps; Children; Maternal; mHealth; Mobile","Klasnja, P., Pratt, W., Healthcare in the pocket: mapping the space of mobile-phone health interventions (2012) J Biomed Inform, 45, pp. 184-198; Liu, C., Status and trends of mobile-health applications for iOS devices: A developer’s perspective (2011) J Syst Softw, 84, pp. 2022-2033; Kay, M., Santos, J., Takane, M., (2011) mHealth: new horizons for health through mobile technologies, , World Health Organization, Geneva; Parker, R.M., Text4baby in the United States and Russia: an opportunity for understanding how mHealth affects maternal and child health (2012) J Health Commun, 17, pp. 30-36; Tamrat, T., Kachnowski, S., Special delivery: an analysis of mHealth in maternal and newborn health programs and their outcomes around the world (2012) Matern Child Health J, 16, pp. 1092-1101; Mulvaney SA, Ho Y-X, Cala CM et al.

The information recovery rate from the emanated video signal varies depending on the SNR of the receiver system, which is placed a certain distance away. In this study, a situation in which the signal from a digital video system is intercepted is modeled using full-wave electromagnetic and circuit simulations. For a quantitative evaluation of the eavesdropping threat of display systems and the effect of its countermeasure, the readability of characters on a hypothetical screen as a function of the BER of the recovery signals is presented. It is clear that a decrease of the SNR of the received signal causes a deterioration of the digital video signal-recovery rate and consequently degrades the legibility of the characters on the intercepted screen. It is expected that these techniques can be useful for measurements and analyses of the effects of countermeasures, such as noise jamming or signal modulation, to prevent interceptions of digital video information. © 1964-2012 IEEE.","Common-mode noise; differential signaling; digital video interface (DVI); eavesdrop; emanation; high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI); leakage model; low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS); printed circuit board (PCB); pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS); S-parameters; signal integrity; signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); simultaneous switching noise; video graphic array (VGA)","Park, S.-G., Kim, J.-S., Yook, J.-G., Park, H.-K., Multilayer power delivery network design for reduction of emi and ssn in high-speed microprocessor system (2002) J.

SDRs differ from traditional radios that typically employ custom silicon to implement such functions. SDRs exhibit several advantages over traditional radios, including re-configurability and reduced development costs and time-to-market since they do not require custom silicon. SDRs also enjoy long life cycles, since they can readily be adapted to meet future needs. Cognitive Radios (CRs) are a special class of SDRs that employ adaptive DSP technologies to implement spectral management. This enables CRs to deliver improved effective bandwidth, quality of service, and enhanced security, which have become increasingly important in modern commercial and military wireless communications applications. © 1998-2012 IEEE.","Computer architecture; Digital signal processing; Instruments; Radio frequency; Receivers; Software; Testing","Harris, F., Lowdermilk, R.W., Software defined radio: Part 22 in a series of tutorials on instrumentation and measurement (2010) IEEE Instrum.

Unexpected bursty arrivals may result in severe collisions in RACHs and thus degrade users' service qualities. This paper presents an analytical model for investigating the transient behavior of the RACHs with bursty arrivals generated in a specific time interval for orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) wireless networks. The proposed model has considered the implementation details of the OFDMA random access procedure (such as periodic access characteristic, uniform random backoff policy, and power-ramping effect) and the effect of new arrivals. The performance metrics of collision probability, success probability, and average access delay and the cumulative distribution function of the number of preamble transmissions and access delay for the successfully accessed mobile station are then derived based on the analytical model. The accuracy of the proposed analytical model was verified through computer simulations, and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","multichannel slotted ALOHA; random access; transient behavior","(2010) ""evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) Medium Access Control (MAC) Protocol Specification, , Cedex, France, 3GPP TS 36.321 V9.3.0, Jun; Laya, A., Alonso, L., Alonso-Zarate, J., Is the random access channel of LTE and LTE-A suitable for M2M communications?

While the current trends in software vulnerability discovery indicate that the number of newly discovered vulnerabilities continues to be significant, the time between the public disclosure of vulnerabilities and the release of an automated exploit is shrinking. Thus, assessing the vulnerability exploitability risk is critical because this allows decision-makers to prioritize among vulnerabilities, allocate resources to patch and protect systems from these vulnerabilities, and choose between alternatives. Common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) metrics have become the de facto standard for assessing the severity of vulnerabilities. However, the CVSS exploitability measures assign subjective values based on the views of experts. Two of the factors in CVSS, Access Vector and Authentication, are the same for almost all vulnerabilities. CVSS does not specify how the third factor, Access Complexity, is measured, and hence it is unknown whether it considers software properties as a factor. In this work, we introduce a novel measure, Structural Severity, which is based on software properties, namely attack entry points, vulnerability location, the presence of the dangerous system calls, and reachability analysis. These properties represent metrics that can be objectively derived from attack surface analysis, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation analysis. To illustrate the proposed approach, 25 reported vulnerabilities of Apache HTTP server and 86 reported vulnerabilities of Linux Kernel have been examined at the source code level. The results show that the proposed approach, which uses more detailed information, can objectively measure the risk of vulnerability exploitability and results can be different from the CVSS base scores. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Attack surface; CVSS metrics; Risk assessment; Software security metrics; Software vulnerability; Source code analysis",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925655295

Onion routing has been employed as an infrastructure for anonymous communication over a public network, which provides anonymous connections that are strongly resistant to both eavesdropping and traffic analysis. However, existing onion routing protocols usually exhibit poor performance due to repeated encryption operations. In this paper, we first present an improved anonymous multi-receiver identity-based encryption (AMRIBE) scheme, and an improved identity-based one-way anonymous key agreement (IBOWAKE) protocol. We then propose an efficient onion routing protocol named AIB-OR that provides provable security and strong anonymity. Our main approach is to use our improved AMRIBE scheme and improved IBOWAKE protocol in onion routing circuit construction. Compared with other onion routing protocols, AIB-OR provides high efficiency, scalability, strong anonymity and fault tolerance. Performance measurements from a prototype implementation show that our proposed AIB-OR can achieve high bandwidths and low latencies when deployed over the Internet. © 2015 Wang et al.",,"Ren, J., Wu, J., Survey on Anonymous Communications in Computer Networks (2010) Computer Communications, 33 (4), pp. 420-431; Shamir, A., Identity-Based Cryptosystems and Signature Schemes.

A semiquantum user can prepare and measure qubits only in the computational basis and so must rely on this quantum server to produce qubits in alternative bases and also to perform alternative measurements. However, we assume that the server is untrusted and we prove the unconditional security of our protocol even in the worst case: when this quantum server is an all-powerful adversary. We also compute a lower bound of the key rate of our protocol, in the asymptotic scenario, as a function of the observed error rate in the channel, allowing us to compute the maximally tolerated error of our protocol.

Our scheme has a tight reduction to the decisional short discrete logarithm problem, while still maintaining the non-tight reduction to the computational version of the problem upon which the original scheme of Girault et al. is based. The second signature scheme we construct is a modification of the scheme of Lyubashevsky (Advances in Cryptology—ASIACRYPT 2009, vol 5912 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp 598–616, Tokyo, Japan, December 6–10, 2009. Springer, Berlin, 2009) that is based on the worst-case hardness of the shortest vector problem in ideal lattices. And the third scheme is a very simple signature scheme that is based directly on the hardness of the subset sum problem. We also present a general transformation that converts what we term (Formula presented.) identification schemes into signature schemes with tight security reductions. We believe that this greatly simplifies the task of constructing and proving the security of such signature schemes. © 2015 International Association for Cryptologic Research","Fiat-Shamir; Signature schemes; Tight reductions",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925583254

It is often useful to verify more complex properties relating to the route decision procedure – for example, whether the chosen route was the best one available, or whether it was consistent with the network's peering agreements. However, this is difficult to do without knowing a network's routing policy and full routing state, which are not normally disclosed. In this paper, we show how a network can allow its peers to verify a number of nontrivial properties of its interdomain routing decisions without revealing any additional information. If all the properties hold, the peers learn nothing beyond what the interdomain routing protocol already reveals; if a property does not hold, at least one peer can detect this and prove the violation. We present SPIDeR, a practical system that applies this approach to the Border Gateway Protocol, and we report results from an experimental evaluation to demonstrate that SPIDeR has a reasonable overhead.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925873007

This promising computing paradigm is able to realize client-cloud cooperative computations. It also brings in new security concerns and challenges, such as input/output privacy and efficiency. Since large matrix rank decomposition computation (RDC) is ubiquitous in the fields of science and engineering, a first step is taken forward to design a protocol that enables clients to securely and efficiently outsource RDC to a public cloud in this paper. It is analytically shown that the proposed protocol is correct and secure. Extensive theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation also show its high-efficiency and immediate practicability. It is hoped that the proposed protocol can shed light on designing other novel secure outsourcing protocols, and inspire powerful companies and working groups to finish the programming of the demanded all-inclusive scientific computations outsourcing software system. It is believed that such software system can be profitable by means of providing large-scale scientific computation services for so many potential clients.

Here, we describe a new strategy for making monovalent bispecific heterodimeric IgG antibodies in mammalian cells. We applied an electrostatic steering mechanism to engineer antibody light chain-heavy chain (LC-HC) interface residues in such a way that each LC strongly favors its cognate HC when two different HCs and two different LCs are co-expressed in the same cell to assemble a functional bispecific antibody. We produced heterodimeric IgGs from transiently and stably transfected mammalian cells. The engineered heterodimeric IgG molecules maintain the overall IgG structure with correct LC-HC pairings, bind to two different antigens with comparable affinity when compared with their parental antibodies, and retain the functionality of parental antibodies in biological assays. In addition, the bispecific heterodimeric IgG derived from anti-HER2 and anti-EGF receptor (EGFR) antibody was shown to induce a higher level of receptor internalization than the combination of two parental antibodies. Mouse xenograft BxPC-3, Panc-1, and Calu-3 human tumor models showed that the heterodimeric IgGs strongly inhibited tumor growth. The described approach can be used to generate tools from two pre-existent antibodies and explore the potential of bispecific antibodies. The asymmetrically engineered Fc variants for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity enhancement could be embedded in monovalent bispecific heterodimeric IgG to make best-in-class therapeutic antibodies. © 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Jemal, A., Siegel, R., Xu, J., Ward, E., Cancer statistics, 2010 (2010) CA Cancer J.

However, performance enhancement of human detection based on visible light cameras is limited, because of factors, such as nonuniform illumination, shadows and low external light in the evening and night. Consequently, human detection based on thermal (far-infrared light) cameras has been considered as an alternative. However, its performance is influenced by the factors, such as low image resolution, low contrast and the large noises of thermal images. It is also affected by the high temperature of backgrounds during the day. To solve these problems, we propose a new method for detecting human areas in thermal camera images. Compared to previous works, the proposed research is novel in the following four aspects. One background image is generated by median and average filtering. Additional filtering procedures based on maximum gray level, size filtering and region erasing are applied to remove the human areas from the background image. Secondly, candidate human regions in the input image are located by combining the pixel and edge difference images between the input and background images. The thresholds for the difference images are adaptively determined based on the brightness of the generated background image. Noise components are removed by component labeling, a morphological operation and size filtering. Third, detected areas that may have more than two human regions are merged or separated based on the information in the horizontal and vertical histograms of the detected area. This procedure is adaptively operated based on the brightness of the generated background image. Fourth, a further procedure for the separation and removal of the candidate human regions is performed based on the size and ratio of the height to width information of the candidate regions considering the camera viewing direction and perspective projection. Experimental results with two types of databases confirm that the proposed method outperforms other methods. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Adaptive threshold; Background subtraction; Generation of background image; Human detection; Thermal camera image","Arandjelović, O., Contextually Learnt Detection of Unusual Motion-Based Behaviour in Crowded Public Spaces (2011) In Proceedings of the 26th Annual International Symposium on Computer and Information Science, pp. 403-410. , London, UK, 26-28 September; Martin, R., Arandjelović, O., Multiple-Object Tracking in Cluttered and Crowded Public Spaces (2010) Lect.

Nonetheless, for a secure operation also the availability must be taken into account, especially as these structures turn into vital targets for Denial-of-Service attacks. Within this article we present metrics to rate different network topologies with regard to their resistance against botnets, whose available attack bandwidth is not a limiting factor. The presented metrics consider random, greedy, and optimally operating attackers, and are used to derive several properties that very resilient overlay topologies must have. In particular a low constant node degree and high girth are identified.

The construction of traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that use manually created rules based upon expert knowledge is knowledge-intensive and is not suitable in the context of this big data problem. This paper presents a systematic and automated approach to build a hybrid IDS that learns temporal state-based specifications for power system scenarios including disturbances, normal control operations, and cyber-attacks. A data mining technique called common path mining is used to automatically and accurately learn patterns for scenarios from a fusion of synchrophasor measurement data, and power system audit logs. As a proof of concept, an IDS prototype was implemented and validated. The IDS prototype accurately classifies disturbances, normal control operations, and cyber-attacks for the distance protection scheme for a two-line three-bus power transmission system.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925061964

The development of dense genetic and physical maps, as the basis for implementing genetic and molecular approaches to accelerate the rate of genetic gains in breeding program represents a significant challenge. A reference genome sequence for cassava has been made recently available and community efforts are underway for improving its quality. Cassava is threatened by several pathogens, but the mechanisms of defense are far from being understood. Besides, there has been a lack of information about the number of genes related to immunity as well as their distribution and genomic organization in the cassava genome. Results: A high dense genetic map of cassava containing 2,141 SNPs has been constructed. Eighteen linkage groups were resolved with an overall size of 2,571 cM and an average distance of 1.26 cM between markers. More than half of mapped SNPs (57.4%) are located in coding sequences. Physical mapping of scaffolds of cassava whole genome sequence draft using the mapped markers as anchors resulted in the orientation of 687 scaffolds covering 45.6% of the genome. One hundred eighty nine new scaffolds are anchored to the genetic cassava map leading to an extension of the present cassava physical map with 30.7 Mb. Comparative analysis using anchor markers showed strong co-linearity to previously reported cassava genetic and physical maps. In silico based searching for conserved domains allowed the annotation of a repertory of 1,061 cassava genes coding for immunity-related proteins (IRPs). Based on physical map of the corresponding sequencing scaffolds, unambiguous genetic localization was possible for 569 IRPs. Conclusions: This is the first study reported so far of an integrated high density genetic map using SNPs with integrated genetic and physical localization of newly annotated immunity related genes in cassava. These data build a solid basis for future studies to map and associate markers with single loci or quantitative trait loci for agronomical important traits. The enrichment of the physical map with novel scaffolds is in line with the efforts of the cassava genome sequencing consortium. © 2015 Soto et al.","Genotyping by sequencing; Immunity-related genes; Linkage mapping; Physical mapping; Single nucleotide polymorphisms","Davey, J.W., Hohenlohe, P.A., Etter, P.D., Boone, J.Q., Catchen, J.M., Blaxter, M.L., Genome-wide genetic marker discovery and genotyping using next-generation sequencing (2011) Nature Rev, 12 (7), pp. 499-510; Elshire, R.J., Glaubitz, J.C., Sun, Q., Poland, J.A., Kawamoto, K., Buckler, E.S., A robust, simple genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach for high diversity species (2011) PLoS One, 6 (5), p. e19379; Takagi, H., Abe, A., Yoshida, K., Kosugi, S., Natsume, S., Mitsuoka, C., QTL-seq: rapid mapping of quantitative trait loci in rice by whole genome resequencing of DNA from two bulked populations (2013) Plant J, 74 (1), pp. 174-183; Nielsen, R., Paul, J.S., Albrechtsen, A., Song, Y.S., Genotype and SNP calling from next-generation sequencing data (2011) Nature Rev, 12 (6), pp. 443-451; Poland, J.A., Brown, P.J., Sorrells, M.E., Jannink, J.L., Development of high-density genetic maps for barley and wheat using a novel two-enzyme genotyping-by-sequencing approach (2012) PLoS One, 7 (2), p. 28; Liu, H., Bayer, M., Druka, A., Russell, J., Hackett, C., Poland, J., An evaluation of genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to map the Breviaristatum-e (ari-e) locus in cultivated barley (2014) BMC Genomics, 15 (1), pp. 1-11; Spindel, J., Wright, M., Chen, C., Cobb, J., Gage, J., Harrington, S., Bridging the genotyping gap: using genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to add high-density SNP markers and new value to traditional bi-parental mapping and breeding populations (2013) TAG Theor Appl Genet, 126 (11), pp. 2699-2716; Ward, J., Bhangoo, J., Fernández-Fernández, F., Moore, P., Swanson, J.D., Viola, R., Saturated linkage map construction in Rubus idaeus using genotyping by sequencing and genome-independent imputation (2013) BMC Genomics, 14 (1), pp. 1-14; Gore, M.A., Fang, D.D., Poland, J.A., Zhang, J., Percy, R.G., Cantrell, R.G., Linkage Map Construction and Quantitative Trait Locus Analysis of Agronomic and Fiber Quality Traits in Cotton (2014) Plant Gen, 7, p. 1; Rabbi, I.Y., Hamblin, M.T., Kumar, P.L., Gedil, M.A., Ikpan, A.S., Jannink, J.L., High-resolution mapping of resistance to cassava mosaic geminiviruses in cassava using genotyping-by-sequencing and its implications for breeding (2014) Virus Res, 186, pp. 87-96; Wurdack, K.J., Hoffmann, P., Chase, M.W., Molecular phylogenetic analysis of uniovulate Euphorbiaceae (Euphorbiaceae sensu stricto) using plastid RBCL and TRNL-F DNA sequences (2005) Am J Bot, 92 (8), pp. 1397-1420; Olsen, K.M., Schaal, B.A., Evidence on the origin of cassava: phylogeography of Manihot esculenta (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 96 (10), pp. 5586-5591; Raji, A.A., Anderson, J.V., Kolade, O.A., Ugwu, C.D., Dixon, A.G., Ingelbrecht, I.L., Gene-based microsatellites for cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz): prevalence, polymorphisms, and cross-taxa utility (2009) BMC Plant Biol, 9, p. 118; Sakurai, T., Mochida, K., Yoshida, T., Akiyama, K., Ishitani, M., Seki, M., Genome-wide discovery and information resource development of DNA polymorphisms in cassava (2013) PLoS One, 8 (9), p. e74056; Ceballos, H., Okogbenin, E., Pérez, J.C., Becerra López-Lavalle, L.A., Debouck, D., (2010), pp. 53-96Jarvis, A., Ramirez-Villegas, J., Campo, B.V.H., Navarro-Racines, C., Is cassava the answer to African climate change adaptation?

A security layer is introduced to the secure architecture of a virtualized server as an abstraction. Because the security layer will play a key role in securing the virtualized server, there is a need for it to be sufficiently robust to tackle the most common security threats associated with cloud computing. First, security threats to cloud computing are analysed based on a publication from an international organization and the security issues surrounding virtualized servers are clarified. Following this, the security elements and their functions for each of the security requirements for virtualized servers are defined. The relationship between the security issues and security elements is then presented to verify the effectiveness of the security layer. It is shown that, using the proposed security elements, the security issues facing virtualized server systems in cloud computing are adequately mitigated. Therefore, our research will be helpful in the development of virtualized servers by making cloud computing more secure. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Cloud computing; Hypervisor; Security elements; Security requirements; Virtualization",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924674294

Websites contain vast amounts of personal privacy information. In order to protect this information, network security technologies, such as database protection and data encryption, attract many researchers. The most serious problems concerning web vulnerability are e-mail address and network database leakages. These leakages have many causes. For example, malicious users can steal database contents, taking advantage of mistakes made by programmers and administrators. In order to mitigate this type of abuse, a website information disclosure assessment system is proposed in this study. This system utilizes a series of technologies, such as web crawler algorithms, SQL injection attack detection, and web vulnerability mining, to assess a website's information disclosure. Thirty websites, randomly sampled from the top 50 world colleges, were used to collect leakage information.

During the assessment from techno-economic perspective, in addition to the level of the user demand, we also take into account the wall penetration losses, density of existing/new base station sites and the recent improvements in cost of the hierarchical cell structures. We consider a spectral efficiency relevant for the forthcoming advanced radio access technologies like: 4G LTE-Advanced or LTE-A (Long Term Evolution Release 10 and beyond), 5G cellular systems deployed in the millimeter-wave (mmW) bands and high-capacity wireless local area network (WLAN) standards like IEEE 802.11ac/ad. In order to compare the achievable profit margins of various network architectures, through extensive network dimensioning for the dense-urban environment and considering the total network cost in present value, we determine the cost-efficient capacity expansion strategies for the mobile network operators by means of proper relation of the production cost per transferred data to the revenues. The findings show that the future micro base stations equipped with 5G mmW radio access technology and WLAN equipped with IEEE 802.11ac access points, can be a guarantee for the business sustainability of outdoor operations. For the highly demanding office environments the most cost-efficient solutions are the pico 5G mmW systems placed inside the buildings together with the IEEE 802.11ad enabled access points. The infrastructure cost is most elastic to a decrease of the unit cost per macro and micro base stations from one side and the capacity and coverage increase of the 5G and WLAN systems form other side. In the cases of the capacity over-provisioning, we determine the principles to provide guaranteed quality of service in terms of data rates to particular number of users. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","5G Millimeter wave; Cost elasticity; Cost-capacity performance; Cost-efficiency modeling; IEEE 802.11ac/ad; LTE-Advanced; Profit margin",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924358720

However, MANETs are susceptible to various transient as well as permanent failures and a fault tolerance technique is crucial in order to effectively utilize the constituent nodes as viable compute resources. Checkpointing and message logging based rollback recovery is a well established approach to provide fault tolerance in static and cellular mobile distributed systems; yet its use for achieving fault tolerance in MANETs is comparatively less explored. The existing recovery algorithms cannot be applied directly to MANETs due to their insufficiency in handling challenges like absence of static infrastructure, frequent node movement, constrained wireless bandwidth and limited stable storage. In this paper, we propose a checkpointing based rollback recovery protocol for clustered MANETs that determines the checkpointing frequency of a mobile node based on its mobility; thereby avoiding unnecessary checkpoints. The protocol uses a popular graph theoretic construct called connected dominating set to lower the communication overhead due to the recovery procedure. The findings of our scheme have been substantiated by the complexity analysis and simulation under varying network conditions. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Checkpointing; Connected dominating set; Message logging; Mobility; Rollback recovery",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924384877

Therefore, suitable activities aligned with the software development process are required to master security evolution. This introduction to the special section on eternal security evolution presents a process for handling security evolution throughout the software development lifecycle and uses this process to position the individual contributions. We first present the underlying security development process comprising the phases initialization, security analysis, security design, security implementation, security testing, and security deployment. On this basis, we define the security evolution process comprising the activities security requirements review, adaptation of design models, code fixing and patch development, regression testing as well as re-deployment. Finally, the defined security evolution activities are discussed in context of the four articles on eternal security evolution presented in this special section of the International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Change; Maintenance; Security engineering; Security evolution; Security measures; Software evolution",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924250086

The applications for these systems run in a myriad of sensors with different low-level programming abstractions, limited capabilities and different routing protocols. This means that applications for WSNs need mechanisms for self-adaptation and for self-protection based on the dynamic adaptation of the algorithms used to provide security. Dynamic software product lines (DSPLs) allow managing both variability and dynamic software adaptation, so they can be considered a key technology in successfully developing self-protected WSN applications. In this paper, we propose a self-protection solution for WSNs based on the combination of the INTER-TRUST security framework (a solution for the dynamic negotiation and deployment of security policies) and the FamiWare middleware (a DSPL approach to automatically configure and reconfigure instances of a middleware for WSNs).We evaluate our approach using a case study from the intelligent transportation system domain. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Dynamic software product lines; FamiWare; INTER-TRUST; Security frameworks; Self-adaptation; Self-protection","Khan, M.K., Xiang, Y., Horng, S.J., Chen, H.H., Trust, Security, and Privacy in Next-Generation Wireless Sensor Networks (2013) Int.

In turn, discovered weaknesses are a major driver for incepting security requirements. Despite its successful adoption, to date no empirical study has been carried out to quantify the cost and effectiveness of STRIDE. The contribution of this paper is the evaluation of STRIDE via a descriptive study that involved 57 students in their last master year in computer science. The study addresses three research questions. First, it assesses how many valid threats per hour are produced on average. Second, it evaluates the correctness of the analysis results by looking at the average number of false positives, i.e., the incorrect threats. Finally, it determines the completeness of the analysis results by looking at the average number of false negatives, i.e., the overlooked threats. © 2013, Springer-Verlag London.","Anti-requirements; Empirical study; Secure software; STRIDE; Threat modeling","Avgeriou, P., Grundy, J., Hall, J., Lago, P., (2011) Relating software requirements and architectures, , Springer, Berlin; Berander, P., (2004) Using students as subjects in requirements prioritization, , In: International symposium on empirical software engineering (ISESE; Carver, J., Jaccheri, L., Morasca, S., A checklist for integrating student empirical studies with research and teaching goals (2010) Empir Softw Eng, 15 (1), pp. 35-59; Chandra, P., Wohleber, T., Feragamo, J., Williams, J., CLASP v1.2: comprehensive (2007) lightweight application security process, , Tech. rep., OWASP; Clements, P., Kazman, R., Klein, M., (2001) Evaluating software architectures: methods and case studies, , Addison-Wesley, Reading; Deng, M., Wuyts, K., Scandariato, R., Preneel, B., Joosen, W., A privacy threat analysis framework (2011) Requir Eng, 16 (1), pp. 3-32; Dhillon, D., Developer-driven threat modeling: lessons learned in the trenches (2011) IEEE Secur Priv, 9 (4), pp. 41-47; Diallo, M., Romero-Mariona, J., Sim, S.E., Alspaugh, T., Richardson, D., A comparative evaluation of three approaches to specifying security requirements (2006) In: Working conference on requirements engineering: foundation for software quality (REFSQ); Fabian, B., Gürses, S., Heisel, M., Santen, T., Schmidt, H., A comparison of security requirements engineering methods (2010) Requir Eng, 15 (1), pp. 7-40; Grimes, D., Schulz, K., Descriptive studies: what they can and cannot do (2002) Lancet, 359, pp. 145-149; Haley, C., Laney, R., Moffett, J., Nuseibeh, B., Security requirements engineering: a framework for representation and analysis (2008) IEEE Trans Softw Eng, 34 (1), pp. 133-153; Hatebur, D., Heisel, M., Schmidt, H., A pattern system for security requirements engineering.

Cloud data privacy and security protection is a crucial issue that impacts the success of cloud computing and may impede the development of 5G. Literature has proposed a number of cloud data access control schemes. However, existing solutions suffer from high computation complexity and cost and therefore few of them have been really deployed in practice. In this paper, we propose a practical scheme to securely access cloud data and effectively reduce access risk according to the reputations of cloud computing entities by applying proxy re-encryption in the situation that the data owner is not available online or does not know how to control the access. The advantages, security and performance of the proposed scheme are evaluated and justified through extensive analysis, security proof and implementation. The results show the efficiency and effectiveness of our scheme for practical deployment. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Access control; Cloud computing; Data security; Reputation; Trust",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923834491

These attacks have pushed away potential business firms and individuals whose aim is to get the best benefit in e-commerce with minimal losses. The attacks occur during interactions between the trading peers as a transaction takes place. In this paper, we propose how to address Sybil attack, an active attack, in which peers can have bogus and multiple identities to fake their owns. Most existing work, which concentrates on social networks and trusted certification, has not been able to prevent Sybil attack peers from doing transactions. Our work exploits the neighbor similarity trust relationship to address Sybil attack. In our approach, duplicated Sybil attack peers can be identified as the neighbor peers become acquainted and hence more trusted to each other. Security and performance analysis shows that Sybil attack can be minimized by our proposed neighbor similarity trust. © 2014 IEEE.","Collusion attack; Neighbor similarity; P2P; Sybil attack; Trust","Douceur, J., The sybil attack (2002) Proc.

It can make the clients verify whether their outsourced data is kept intact without downloading the whole data. In some application scenarios, the clients have to store their data on multicloud servers. At the same time, the integrity checking protocol must be efficient in order to save the verifier's cost. From the two points, we propose a novel remote data integrity checking model: ID-DPDP (identity-based distributed provable data possession) in multicloud storage. The formal system model and security model are given. Based on the bilinear pairings, a concrete ID-DPDP protocol is designed. The proposed ID-DPDP protocol is provably secure under the hardness assumption of the standard CDH (computational Diffie-Hellman) problem. In addition to the structural advantage of elimination of certificate management, our ID-DPDP protocol is also efficient and flexible. Based on the client's authorization, the proposed ID-DPDP protocol can realize private verification, delegated verification, and public verification. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","bilinear pairings; Cloud computing; distributed computing; identity-based cryptography; provable data possession","Ateniese, G., Burns, R., Curtmola, R., Herring, J., Kissner, L., Peterson, Z., Song, D., Provable Data Possession at Untrusted Stores Proc.

In the presence of malevolent nodes, this requirement may lead to serious security concerns; for instance, such nodes may disrupt the routing process. In this context, preventing or detecting malicious nodes launching grayhole or collaborative blackhole attacks is a challenge. This paper attempts to resolve this issue by designing a dynamic source routing (DSR)-based routing mechanism, which is referred to as the cooperative bait detection scheme (CBDS), that integrates the advantages of both proactive and reactive defense architectures. Our CBDS method implements a reverse tracing technique to help in achieving the stated goal. Simulation results are provided, showing that in the presence of malicious-node attacks, the CBDS outperforms the DSR, 2ACK, and best-effort fault-tolerant routing (BFTR) protocols (chosen as benchmarks) in terms of packet delivery ratio and routing overhead (chosen as performance metrics). © 2014 IEEE.","collaborative bait detection; collaborative blackhole attacks; Cooperative bait detection scheme (CBDS); detection mechanism; dynamic source routing (DSR); grayhole attacks; malicious node; mobile ad hoc network (MANET)","Tsou, P.-C., Chang, J.-M., Chao, H.-C., Chen, J.-L., CBDS: A cooperative bait detection scheme to prevent malicious node forMANET based on hybrid defense architecture (2011) Proc. 2nd Intl.

However, many security issues impede its wide deployment in practice. Besides the well-studied pollution attacks, there is another severe threat, that of wormhole attacks, which undermines the performance gain of network coding. Since the underlying characteristics of network coding systems are distinctly different from traditional wireless networks, the impact of wormhole attacks and countermeasures are generally unknown. In this paper, we quantify wormholes' devastating harmful impact on network coding system performance through experiments. We first propose a centralized algorithm to detect wormholes and show its correctness rigorously. For the distributed wireless network, we propose DAWN, a Distributed detection Algorithm against Wormhole in wireless Network coding systems, by exploring the change of the flow directions of the innovative packets caused by wormholes. We rigorously prove that DAWN guarantees a good lower bound of successful detection rate. We perform analysis on the resistance of DAWN against collusion attacks. We find that the robustness depends on the node density in the network, and prove a necessary condition to achieve collusion-resistance. DAWN does not rely on any location information, global synchronization assumptions or special hardware/middleware. It is only based on the local information that can be obtained from regular network coding protocols, and thus the overhead of our algorithms is tolerable. Extensive experimental results have verified the effectiveness and the efficiency of DAWN. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","expected transmission count; random linear network coding; Wireless networks; wormhole attack","Li, S., Yeung, R., Cai, N., Linear network coding (2003) IEEE Trans.

Aspen Plus is employed to simulate various BG-SOFC CHP systems. The aim of the research work is to investigate the technical feasibility of these systems and to study the influence of important operating parameters and examine integration options. Systems based on dual fluidised bed steam gasification and tubular SOFC technologies are modelled. The cathode recycle and electric heater integration options are not attractive in comparison to the base case anode recycle system. Thermal integration, i.e. using SOFC flue gas as gasifier oxidant, is desirable. Lowering the syngas preheat temperature (prior to SOFC anodes) is highly recommended and is more practical than lowering the cathode air preheat temperature. Results of the parametric study indicate that: steam to carbon ratio and biomass moisture content should be as low as possible; fuel utilisation factor can change the mode of operation of the plant (focus on electricity or heat); high temperature syngas cleaning is very attractive; gasification air preheating is more attractive than gasification steam superheating. High efficiencies are predicted, proving the technical feasibility of BG-SOFC CHP systems. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we analyze the possibility of using data stream mining for enhancing the security of AMI through an intrusion detection system (IDS), which is a second line of defense after the primary security methods of encryption, authentication, authorization, etc. We propose a realistic and reliable IDS architecture for the whole AMI system, which consists of individual IDSs for three different levels of AMI's components: smart meter, data concentrator, and AMI headend. We also explore the performances of various existing state-of-the-art data stream mining algorithms on a publicly available IDS data set, namely, the KDD Cup 1999 data set. Then, we conduct a feasibility analysis of using these existing data stream mining algorithms, which exhibit varying levels of accuracies, memory requirements, and running times, for the distinct IDSs at AMI's three different components.

Moreover, home gateways are typically always on, so as to provide continuous online presence to household devices for VoIP, smart metering, security surveillance, medical monitoring, etc. A natural solution for reducing the energy consumption of home gateways is to leverage the overlap of Wi-Fi networks common in urban environments and aggregate user traffic on to fewer gateways, thus putting the remaining to sleep. In this paper we propose, evaluate, and prototype an architecture that overcomes significant challenges in making this solution feasible at large-scale. We advocate a centralized approach, whereby a single authority co-ordinates the home gateways to maximize energy savings in a fair manner. Our solution can be implemented across heterogeneous ISPs, avoids client-side modifications (thus encompassing arbitrary user devices and operating systems), and permits explicit control of session migrations. We apply our solution to Wi-Fi traces collected in a building with 30 access points and 25,000 client connections, and evaluate via simulation the tradeoffs between energy savings, session disruptions, and fairness. We then prototype our system on commodity Wi-Fi access points, test it in a two-storey building emulating 6 residences, and demonstrate radio energy reduction of over 60 percent with little impact on user experience. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","bandwidth aggregation; centralized control; energy consumption; Home Wi-Fi networks; system evaluation","Tucker, R., Baliga, J., Ayre, R., Hinton, K., Sorin, W., Energy consumption of IP networks Proc.

New cost-effective tools for software quality assurance are needed. This paper presents an automated test generation technique, called Model-based Integration and System Test Automation (MISTA), for integrated functional and security testing of software systems. Given a Model-Implementation Description (MID) specification, MISTA generates test code that can be executed immediately with the implementation under test. The MID specification uses a high-level Petri net to capture both control- and data-related requirements for functional testing, access control testing, or penetration testing with threat models. After generating test cases from the test model according to a given criterion, MISTA converts the test cases into executable test code by mapping model-level elements into implementation-level constructs. MISTA has implemented test generators for various test coverage criteria of test models, code generators for various programming and scripting languages, and test execution environments such as Java, C, C++, C#, HTML-Selenium IDE, and Robot Framework. MISTA has been applied to the functional and security testing of various real-world software systems. Our experiments have demonstrated that MISTA can be highly effective in fault detection. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Functional testing; model-based testing; Petri nets; security testing; software assurance","Zender, J., Schiefewrdecker, I., Mosterman, P., (2011) Model-Based Testing for Embedded Syst., , Boca Raton, FL, USA: CRC Press; Utting, M., Legeard, B., (2006) Practical Model-Based Testing: A Tools Approach, , San Francisco, CA, USA: Morgan Kaufmann; Genrich, H.J., (1987) ""Predicate/transition nets,"" in Petri Nets: Central Models and Their Properties, pp. 207-247. , New York, NY, USA: Springer; Jensen, K., (1992) Coloured Petri Nets: Basic Concepts, Analysis Methods and Practical Use, 26. , New York, NY, USA: Springer-Verlag; Murata, T., Petri nets: Properties, analysis and applications (1989) Proc.

To capture the spoofers, a number of IP traceback mechanisms have been proposed. However, due to the challenges of deployment, there has been not a widely adopted IP traceback solution, at least at the Internet level. As a result, the mist on the locations of spoofers has never been dissipated till now. This paper proposes passive IP traceback (PIT) that bypasses the deployment difficulties of IP traceback techniques. PIT investigates Internet Control Message Protocol error messages (named path backscatter) triggered by spoofing traffic, and tracks the spoofers based on public available information (e.g., topology). In this way, PIT can find the spoofers without any deployment requirement. This paper illustrates the causes, collection, and the statistical results on path backscatter, demonstrates the processes and effectiveness of PIT, and shows the captured locations of spoofers through applying PIT on the path backscatter data set. These results can help further reveal IP spoofing, which has been studied for long but never well understood. Though PIT cannot work in all the spoofing attacks, it may be the most useful mechanism to trace spoofers before an Internet-level traceback system has been deployed in real. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Computer network management; computer network security; denial of service (DoS); IP traceback","Bellovin, S.M., Security problems in the TCP/IP protocol suite (1989) ACM SIGCOMM Comput.

The AVS Working Group was founded in 2002 and is dedicated to providing the digital audio-video industry with highly efficient and economical coding/decoding technologies. So far, the AVS1 video coding standard is widely implemented in regional broadcasting, communication, and digital video entertainment systems. As the successor of AVS1, AVS2 is designed to achieve significant coding efficiency improvements relative to the preceding H.264/MPEG4-AVC and AVS1 standards. The basic coding framework of AVS2 is similar to the conterminous HEVC/H.265, but AVS2 can provide more efficient compression for certain video applications such as surveillance as well as low-delay communication such as videoconferencing. AVS2 is making video coding smarter by adopting intelligent coding tools that not only improve coding efficiency but also help with computer vision tasks such as object detection and tracking. © 1991-2012 IEEE.",,"(2009) HSTP-MCTB Media Coding Toolbox for IPTV: Audio and Video Codecs, , ITU-T Technical paper, ITUT Study Group 16 Working Party 3 meeting, Geneva, Switzerland, 10 July; Ma, S., Wang, S., Gao, W., Overview of IEEE 1857 video coding standard (2013) Proc.

The difference of means (DOM) observed in the execution time of a block cipher is often used as a distinguisher to glean information about the secret key. The root cause for the distinguisher to work has long been attributed to the number of cache-misses that occur during the encryption. In this paper, we show that micro-architectural acceleration features in cache memories that are used to reduce miss-penalty (such as pipelining, parallelism, out-of-order, and non-blocking memory accesses) contribute significantly to the leakage. We develop a framework to analyze the DOM distinguisher considering architectural as well as micro-architectural acceleration components in the cache memory. Our findings, which are experimentally verified, show that the two contributing leakage factors (namely the number of cache misses and the micro-architectural acceleration features) affect the DOM in opposite directions. One leakage source results in a positive DOM while the other causes a negative DOM. This opposing characteristic of the leakages makes it feasible to implement block ciphers in a way such that the two leakages cancel each other, thus leading to implementations with higher resistance against time-driven cache-attacks. © 2013 IEEE.","Cache timing attacks; difference of means; formal analysis; microarchitecture of cache memories","Hennessy, J.L., Patterson, D.A., (2006) Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach, , 4th ed.

Despite the availability of a broad range of face presentation attack detection (PAD) (or countermeasure or antispoofing) schemes, there exists no superior PAD technique due to evolution of sophisticated presentation attacks (or spoof attacks). In this paper, we present a new perspective for face presentation attack detection by introducing light field camera (LFC). Since the use of a LFC can record the direction of each incoming ray in addition to the intensity, it exhibits an unique characteristic of rendering multiple depth (or focus) images in a single capture. Thus, we present a novel approach that involves exploring the variation of the focus between multiple depth (or focus) images rendered by the LFC that in turn can be used to reveal the presentation attacks. To this extent, we first collect a new face artefact database using LFC that comprises of 80 subjects. Face artefacts are generated by simulating two widely used attacks, such as photo print and electronic screen attack. Extensive experiments carried out on the light field face artefact database have revealed the outstanding performance of the proposed PAD scheme when benchmarked with various well established state-of-the-art schemes. © 2015 IEEE.","Biometrics; countermeasure; Face Recognition; light field camera; presentation attack detection; security; spoofing","Anjos, A., Marcel, S., Counter-measures to photo attacks in face recognition: A public database and a baseline (2011) Proc.

Malicious processes can infer secrets from on-chip sensible traffic by evaluating the degradation on their communication performance. Such a threat rises from the resource sharing. In order to avoid such time-driven attacks, the network-on-chip (NoC) can integrate mechanisms to isolate different communication flows. In this letter, we propose two mechanisms, random arbitration and adaptive routing, that dynamically allocate the SoC resources to avoid such attacks. We compare our approach to the unique previous work under several traffic conditions. We demonstrate that our mechanisms are effective to protect the SoC while increasing the overall performance. © 2009-2012 IEEE.","Channel leakage; Network-on-chip; Security","Adi, W., IP-core protection for a non-volatile self-reconfiguring SoC environment Proc. 21st VLSI-SoC, 2013, pp. 252-255; Page, D., Defending against cache-based side-channel attacks (2003) Information Security, 8, pp. 30-44. , Amsterdam, The Netherlands: Ed.

Along with these opportunities come challenges, particularly to service providers and operations centers that struggle to monitor and manage quality of service (QoS) for these services in order to meet customer service commitments. Traditional approaches fall short in addressing these challenges because they examine QoS from a limited perspective rather than from a system-of-systems (SoS) perspective applicable to a net-centric enterprise system in which any user from any location can share computing resources at any time. This paper presents a SoS approach to enable QoS monitoring, management, and response for enterprise systems that deliver computing as a service through a cloud computing environment. A concrete example is provided for application of this new SoS approach to a real-world scenario (viz., distributed denial of service). Simulated results confirm the efficacy of the approach. © 2015 IEEE.","Cloud computing; distributed denial of service (DDoS); enterprise systems; information assurance; net centric; quality of service (QoS); security; service-oriented architecture (SOA); systems of systems (SoS)","Mell, P., Grance, T., The NIST definition of cloud computing (2011) Natl.

To minimize L3 cache hit latency, M7 features a partitioned L3 cache, with a novel on-chip network for communication between the cache partitions, coherence control, and memory. Memory bandwidth is more than 3 times that of the Oracle Sparc M6 processor. On-chip accelerators providing query filtering and decompression can provide another order of magnitude performance increase for these tasks. M7 keeps power consumption at a minimum through multiple power-saving techniques. M7 scales to 32-processor shared memory multiprocessing systems (SMPs). Coherent shared memory is also supported between SMPs in a cluster. Such a cluster is robust against both communication and SMP failure.

Integration of well-defined surface topography into three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds for tissue engineering would be useful to direct the cell fate for intended applications. Technical challenges are remaining as how to fabricate such 3D scaffolds with controlled surface topography from a range of biodegradable and biocompatible materials. In this paper, a novel fabrication process using computer numerically controlled machining and lamination is reported to make 3D calcium phosphate/gelatin composite scaffolds with integrated surface micropatterns that are introduced by embossing prior to machining. Geometric analysis shows that this method is versatile and can be used to make a wide range of lattices with porosities that meet the basic requirements for bone tissue engineering. Both in vitro and in vivo studies show that micropatterned composite scaffolds with surfaces comprising 40 μm pits and 50 μm grooves were optimal for improved osteogenesis. The results have demonstrated the potential of a novel fabrication process for producing cell-instructive scaffolds with designed surface topographies to induce specific tissue regeneration. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","bone; fabrication; microtopography; scaffolds","Jones, J.R., New trends in bioactive scaffolds: The importance of nanostructure (2009) J.

Furthermore, multicasting is considered as an appropriate transmission method for multimedia services. Multimedia applications are expected to become more prevalent over mobile ad hoc networks in the near future. Therefore, achieving reliability in multimedia communications is an important task. Video compression technologies are about reducing and removing redundant video data so that a digital video file can be effectively sent over a network. With modern compression standards, such as Moving Picture Expert Group 2 (MPEG-2), MPEG-4, and H.264, which is also known as advanced video coding MPEG-4 part 10, losses of different frames have different impacts on video quality. In this paper, we propose a leader-based reliable multicast medium-access control layer protocol for multimedia applications to enhance video quality. We present a Markov chain model and numerical formulation of our proposed protocol. Simulation results show that our proposed method is better than other protocols in terms of the number of decodable frames, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and video quality. © 2014 IEEE.","Multicasting; peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR); reliability","Tu, W., Efficient resource utilization for multi-flow wireless multicasting transmissions (2012) IEEE J.

One major risk for elderly people is fall accidents, especially for those living alone. In this paper, we propose a robust fall detection approach by analyzing the tracked key joints of the human body using a single depth camera. Compared to the rivals that rely on the RGB inputs, the proposed scheme is independent of illumination of the lights and can work even in a dark room. In our scheme, a pose-invariant randomized decision tree algorithm is proposed for the key joint extraction, which requires low computational cost during the training and test. Then, the support vector machine classifier is employed to determine whether a fall motion occurs, whose input is the 3-D trajectory of the head joint. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fall detection method is more accurate and robust compared with the state-of-the-art methods. © 2014 IEEE.","3-D; Computer vision; fall detection; head tracking; monocular; video surveillance","Dept.

To achieve these goals, a H-CRAN is presented in this article as the advanced wireless access network paradigm, where cloud computing is used to fulfill the centralized large-scale cooperative processing for suppressing co-channel interferences. The state-of-the-art research achievements in the areas of system architecture and key technologies for H-CRANs are surveyed. Particularly, Node C as a new communication entity is defined to converge the existing ancestral base stations and act as the base band unit pool to manage all accessed remote radio heads. Also, the software-defined H-CRAN system architecture is presented to be compatible with software-defined networks. The principles, performance gains, and open issues of key technologies, including adaptive large-scale cooperative spatial signal processing, cooperative radio resource management, network function virtualization, and self-organization, are summarized. The major challenges in terms of fronthaul constrained resource allocation optimization and energy harvesting that may affect the promotion of H-CRANs are discussed as well. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",,"Mobile Traffic Forecasts: 2010-2020 Report (2011) UMTS Forum Report, , UMTS Forum, Jan; Andrews, J.G., What will 5G be?

Before performing an analysis at full scale, the dynamic positioning (DP) experiments in model ice at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA) allow for the testing of relevant image processing algorithms. A complete overview image of the ice floe distribution in the ice tank was generated from the experiments. An image processing method based on a gradient vector flow (GVF) snake and a distance transform is proposed to identify individual ice floes. Ice floe characteristics such as position, area, and size distribution are obtained. A model of the managed ice field's configuration, including identification of overlapping floes, is also proposed for further studies in ice-force numerical simulations. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to an ice surveillance video to further illustrate its applicability to ice management. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Connected object segmentation; Distance transform; GVF snake; Model ice floe","Banfield, J., Automated tracking of ice floes: a stochastic approach (1991) IEEE Trans.

Despite the promising model and hype surrounding, security has become the major concern that people hesitate to transfer their applications to clouds. Concretely, cloud platform is under numerous attacks. As a result, it is definitely expected to establish a firewall to protect cloud from these attacks. However, setting up a centralized firewall for a whole cloud data center is infeasible from both performance and financial aspects. In this paper, we propose a decentralized cloud firewall framework for individual cloud customers. We investigate how to dynamically allocate resources to optimize resources provisioning cost, while satisfying QoS requirement specified by individual customers simultaneously. Moreover, we establish novel queuing theory based model M/Geo/1 and M/Geo/m for quantitative system analysis, where the service times follow a geometric distribution. By employing Z-transform and embedded Markov chain techniques, we obtain a closed-form expression of mean packet response time. Through extensive simulations and experiments, we conclude that an M/Geo/1 model reflects the cloud firewall real system much better than a traditional M/M/1 model. Our numerical results also indicate that we are able to set up cloud firewall with affordable cost to cloud customers. © 2014 IEEE.","Cloud computing; Firewall; Resources allocation; System modeling","Armbrust, M., Fox, A., Griffith, R., Joseph, A.D., Katz, R., Konwinski, A., Lee, G., Zaharia, M., A view of cloud computing (2010) Commun.

The need for integrating data from multiple sources for the purpose of collaborative visualization has increased in recent years. However, traditional approaches are proving inadequate for several reasons: data size, incompatibility across proprietary file formats, limitations owing to data intellectual property rights, data security, and incompatibility across computing platforms. To address these challenges, this paper explores a simple approach, called Visual Integration (VI), which purposefully limits the exchange of information to only visual artifacts for generating interactive views. VI integrates 3D images from disparate sources in real-time, by comparing the depth information at every combined pixel. VI also preserves independent interactive views of the integrated data for all parties. We report on the design and implementation of a simple prototype created in OpenGL, discuss necessary improvements to create a practical solution, and explore various business scenarios that can benefit from using VI. © 2015 IBM.",,"Kalkofen, D., Mendez, E., Schmalstieg, D., BInteractive focus and context visualization for augmented reality (2007) Proc. 6th IEEE ACM Int.

To provide sensor data reliably irrespective of the sensor locations, the mobile sensors and mobile sensor gateways natively support mobility and multihoming and possess network access authentication and data transport security functions. The sensor owners can freely install new applications over already-deployed mobile sensors and mobile sensor gateways.

However, in the uplink of orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based femtocell systems, the signals from macrocell users (MUs) generally arrive at the femtocell base station (FBS) asynchronously because their transmissions are scheduled to be synchronized at the macrocell base station (MBS). When the timing misalignment caused by the asynchronous reception at the FBS is greater than the cyclic prefix length, intercarrier interference (ICI) will arise in demodulation. In this paper, a performance analysis of uplink OFDMA femtocell network is presented. First, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of MU arrival time is derived. Evaluation shows that the derived CDF is accurate and agrees with simulation results. With the CDF, a closed-form expression of probability mass functions (PMFs) of relative delay of MU signal and probability of ICI occurrence for two synchronization schemes are developed. Based on the PMF of relative delay, ICI power averaged over MU locations for the macrocell using fractional power control is derived for the two synchronization schemes. This new theoretical result helps analyze the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the femtocell, femtocell capacity, and symbol error rate (SER). The theoretical analysis provides a solid evaluation of the effects of ICI for different FBS locations on system performance. It is shown that the performance analysis is quite agreeable with computer simulation. Theory and simulation results show that the system performance of the femtocell using first MU arrival time for synchronization is close to that of no ICI and better than that of using the earliest permissible arrival time. © 2014 IEEE.","Femtocell; intercarrier interference (ICI); orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA); uplink","Chandrasekhar, V., Andrews, J.G., Gatherer, A., Femtocell networks: A survey (2008) IEEE Commun.

Customers can rent the CSPs storage infrastructure to store and retrieve almost unlimited amount of data by paying fees metered in gigabyte/month. For an increased level of scalability, availability, and durability, some customers may want their data to be replicated on multiple servers across multiple data centers. The more copies the CSP is asked to store, the more fees the customers are charged. Therefore, customers need to have a strong guarantee that the CSP is storing all data copies that are agreed upon in the service contract, and all these copies are consistent with the most recent modifications issued by the customers. In this paper, we propose a map-based provable multicopy dynamic data possession (MB-PMDDP) scheme that has the following features: 1) it provides an evidence to the customers that the CSP is not cheating by storing fewer copies; 2) it supports outsourcing of dynamic data, i.e., it supports block-level operations, such as block modification, insertion, deletion, and append; and 3) it allows authorized users to seamlessly access the file copies stored by the CSP. We give a comparative analysis of the proposed MB-PMDDP scheme with a reference model obtained by extending existing provable possession of dynamic single-copy schemes. The theoretical analysis is validated through experimental results on a commercial cloud platform. In addition, we show the security against colluding servers, and discuss how to identify corrupted copies by slightly modifying the proposed scheme. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Cloud computing; data replication; dynamic environment; outsourcing data storage","Ateniese, G., Provable data possession at untrusted stores (2007) Proc. 14th ACM Conf.

Elevated PAI-1 specifically inactivates pulmonary urokinase-type (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activators (tPA). We hypothesized that plasminogen activation and fibrinolysis may alter epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity, a key player in clearing edematous fluid. Two-chain urokinase (tcuPA) has been found to strongly stimulate heterologous human αβγ ENaC activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This activity of tcuPA was completely ablated by PAI-1. Furthermore, a mutation (S195A) of the active site of the enzyme also prevented ENaC activation. By comparison, three truncation mutants of the amino-terminal fragment of tcuPA still activated ENaC. uPA enzymatic activity was positively correlated with ENaC current amplitude prior to reaching the maximal level. In sharp contrast to uPA, neither single-chain tPA nor derivatives, including two-chain tPA and tenecteplase, affected ENaC activity. Furthermore, γ but not α subunit of ENaC was proteolytically cleaved at (177GR↓KR180) by tcuPA. In summary, the underlying mechanisms of urokinase-mediated activation of ENaC include release of self-inhibition, proteolysis of γ ENaC, incremental increase in opening rate, and activation of closed (electrically ""silent"") channels. This study for the first time demonstrates multifaceted mechanisms for uPA-mediated up-regulation of ENaC, which form the cellular and molecular rationale for the beneficial effects of urokinase in mitigating mortal pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. © 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Inc.",,"Shetty, S., Padijnayayveetil, J., Tucker, T., Stankowska, D., Idell, S., The fibrinolytic system and the regulation of lung epithelial cell proteolysis, signaling, and cellular viability (2008) Am.

Jamming, as a kind of denial-of service attack, can be applied to interfere the real-time communication in smart grid. In this paper, we analyze the scenario in which the attacker can jam a reduced number of signal channels carrying measurement information in order to manipulate the locational marginal price and create the opportunity for gaining profit, and the defender is able to guarantee a limited number of channels in information delivery. Based on the electricity marketing model, we propose a multiact dynamic game between the attacker and defender, in which the optimal strategies are taken by the two sides to maximize their own profits. We study the gaming process and discuss the prosperities of the outcome. Simulation results present the affect of jamming attack on the electricity prices and the gained profits of the two sides. Moreover, they confirm the optimality of the proposed scheme in pursuing profit.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923676050

It is shown that the encoded message transferred to the particles called quantum state where we assumed that a photon is used as a qubit and after the encoded message is transferred into photons, the polarization of each photon is rotated by an angle θj, which is chosen randomly for each qubit. The sender and receiver agree over a Hill-cipher key, the encryption occurs by utilization of the quantum three-pass protocol (QTPP), the decryption will be illustrated, and an example shows how the algorithm will work.

Unfortunately, some of the most interesting and powerful datasets-like health records, genetic data, and drug discovery data-cannot be freely shared because they contain sensitive information. In many situations, knowing if private datasets overlap determines if it is worthwhile to navigate the institutional, ethical, and legal barriers that govern access to sensitive, private data. We report the first method of publicly measuring the overlap between private datasets that is secure under a malicious model without relying on private protocols or message passing. This method uses a publicly shareable summary of a dataset's contents, its cryptoset, to estimate its overlap with other datasets. Cryptosets approach ""information-theoretic"" security, the strongest type of security possible in cryptography, which is not even crackable with infinite computing power. We empirically and theoretically assess both the accuracy of these estimates and the security of the approach, demonstrating that cryptosets are informative, with a stable accuracy, and secure. © 2015 Swamidass et al.",,"Mervis, J., Agencies rally to tackle big data (2012) Science, 336, pp. 22-22. , PMID: 22491835; Aggarwal, C.C., Yu, P.S., A general survey of privacy-preserving data mining models and algorithms (2008) Privacy-Preserving Data Mining, 34, pp. 11-52. , Aggarwal CC, Yu PS, Elmagarmid AK, editors Springer US Advances in Database Systems; Karakasidis, A., Verykios, V.S., Secure blocking+ secure matching = secure record linkage (2011) J of Comp Science and Engineering, 5, pp. 101-106; Johnson, S.B., Whitney, G., McAuliffe, M., Wang, H., McCreedy, E., Using global unique identifiers to link autism collections (2010) Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 17, pp. 689-695. , PMID: 20962132; Kuzu, M., Kantarcioglu, M., Durham, E., Malin, B., A constraint satisfaction cryptanalysis of bloom filters in private record linkage (2011) Privacy Enhancing Technologies, pp. 226-245. , Springer; Weber, G.M., Federated queries of clinical data repositories: The sum of the parts does not equal the whole (2013) Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 20, pp. e155-e161. , PMID: 23349080; Jarecki, S., Liu, X., Efficient oblivious pseudorandom function with applications to adaptive ot and secure computation of set intersection (2009) Theory of Cryptography, pp. 577-594. , Springer; Kuzu, M., Kantarcioglu, M., Durham, E.A., Toth, C., Malin, B., A practical approach to achieve private medical record linkage in light of public resources (2013) Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 20, pp. 285-292. , PMID: 22847304; Theocharoulis, K., Papaefstathiou, I., Manifavas, C., Implementing rainbow tables in high-end fpgas for super-fast password cracking (2010) Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL), 2010 International Conference on.

MANETs have become increasingly significant in recent years due to their potential applications. From a technological point of view, the realization of this vision still requires a large number of challenges to be solved related to devices, protocols, applications and services. The drawbacks of MANETs are the limited number of services and applications, limited wireless coverage, limited bandwidth and battery power, and dynamic network topology. The growth of the Internet services and applications and the trend in the fourth generation (4G) wireless networks to all-IP networks have led to an increasing demand for enabling MANET nodes to connect to the Internet and use its services and applications. These kinds of networks are named as hybrid MANETs which can be deployed quickly and easily. The main objective of this paper is to introduce an overview of the different challenges and solutions for MANET–Internet integration. It will also introduce a solid analysis of the most significant proposals by describing their functionality, characteristics, and drawbacks.

In literatures, only a few schemes of identity (ID)-based multi-proxy multi-signature (IBMPMS) from bilinear pairings are available but those schemes cannot be considered practical for implementations because either those are insecure or cost inefficient. Whereas due to numerous applications of IBMPMS scheme in distributed systems, grid computing, global distribution networks, etc., construction of an efficient and secure IBMPMS scheme is desired. In this paper, we propose a new construction of IBMPMS scheme from bilinear pairings. We also discuss a security model for IBMPMS schemes and prove that the proposed scheme is existential unforgeable against adaptive chosen-message and adaptive chosen-ID attacks under the computational Diffie–Hellman (CDH) assumption. Moreover, the proposed scheme is more efficient in the view of computation and operation time than the existing schemes. In particular, our scheme is up to 40 % more efficient and faster than the existing similar schemes. © 2015 Institut Mines-Télécom and Springer-Verlag France","Bilinear pairings; CDHP; Delegation of signing rights; Digital signature; ID-based cryptography; Multi-proxy multi-signature scheme; Provable security; Random oracle",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923250930

The crossover frequency spectrum of the Raji cells was studied by observing the different linear translation responses of these cells to the positive and negative optically induced dielectrophoresis force generated by a projected light pattern. This digitally projected spot served as the virtual electrode to generate an axisymmetric and non-uniform electric field. Then, the membrane capacitance of the Raji cells could be directly measured. Furthermore, Raji cells under this condition also exhibited a self-rotation behavior. The repeatable and controlled self-rotation speeds of the Raji cells to the externally applied frequency and voltage were systematically investigated and characterized via computer-vision algorithms. The self-rotational speed of the Raji cells reached a maximum value at 60?kHz and demonstrated a quadratic relationship with respect to the applied voltage. Furthermore, optically projected patterns of four orthogonal electrodes were also employed as the virtual electrodes to manipulate the Raji cells. These results demonstrated that Raji cells located at the center of the four electrode pattern could not be self-rotated. Instead any Raji cells that deviated from this center area would also self-rotate. Most importantly, the Raji cells did not exhibit the self-rotational behavior after translating and rotating with respect to the center of any two adjacent electrodes. The spatial distributions of the electric field generated by the optically projected spot and the pattern of four electrodes were also modeled using a finite element numerical simulation. These simulations validated that the electric field distributions were non-uniform and non-rotational. Hence, the non-uniform electric field must play a key role in the self-rotation of the Raji cells. As a whole, this study elucidates an optoelectric-coupled microfluidics-based mechanism for cellular translation and self-rotation that can be used to extract the dielectric properties of the cells without using conventional metal-based microelectrodes. This technique may provide a simpler method for label-free identification of cancerous cells with many associated clinical applications. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Yeom, M., Pendergast, J.S., Ohmiya, Y., Yamazaki, S., (2010) Proc.

The main objective of the study is to review patient characteristics of cases of endometriosis nodes in gynaecological scars. Methods: A retrospective, observational and descriptive study with a cohort of patients from Hospital 12 de Octubre was conducted from January 2000 to January 2012. We analysed all of the patients who presented with an endometriosis node in a gynaecological scar presentation who had undergone surgery in that period. Descriptive data were collected and analysed. Results: A total of 17 patients with an anatomopathological diagnosis of an endometriosis node in a gynaecological scar were found. The following variables were studied: the age at diagnosis (32.5years +/- 5.5years), personal and obstetric history, time from surgery to diagnosis (4.2years +/- 3.4years), symptoms (a painful mass that grows during menstruation is the most frequent symptom in our patients), technical analyses by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) or fine needle aspiration (FNA) (77% of the patients), node size (2.5cm +/- 1.1cm) and location (caesarean scar, 82%; episiotomy scar, 11.7%; and laparoscopic surgery port, 5.8%), involvement of adjacent structures (29% of the patients), treatment (exeresis with a security margin in all the patients) and other endometriosis locations (14% of the patients). Conclusions: A high level of suspicion is required to diagnose gynaecological scar endometriosis, which should be suspected in the differential diagnosis of scar masses in reproductive-aged women. © Vellido-Cotelo et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Cutaneous endometriosis; Incisional endometriosis; Perineal endometriosis; Scar endometriosis","Horton, J., DeZee, K., Ahnfeldt, E., Wagner, M., Abdominal wall endometriosis: a surgeon's perspective and review of 445 cases (2008) Am J Surg, 196, pp. 207-212; Bektas, H., Bilsel, Y., Sari, Y., Ersöz, F., Koc, O., Deniz, M., Abdominal wall endometrioma; a 10year experience and brief review of the literature (2010) J Surg Res, 164, p. e77; Nominato, N., Spyer, L., Lauar, I., Morais, J., Maia, L., Geber, S., Caesarean section greatly increases risk of scar endometriosis (2010) Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol, 152, pp. 83-85; Corrêa, G., Pina, L., Korkes, H., Guazzelli, T., Kenj, G., Toledo, A., Scar endometrioma following obstetric surgical icisions: retrospective study on 33 cases and review of literature (2009) Sao Paulo Med J, 127 (5), pp. 270-277; Tood, R.W., Kehoe, S., Gearty, J., A case of clear cell carcinoma arising in extragonadal endometriosis (2000) Int J Gynecol Cancer, 10, pp. 170-172; Hesla, J.S., Rock, J.A., (2003), p. 619. , Endometriosis.

OSNs have revolutionized the human experience, but they have also created a platform for attackers to distribute infections and conduct cybercrime. An OSN provides an opportunistic attack platform for cybercriminals through which they can spread infections at a large scale. We describe a category of malware (or attacks) known as socioware that exploits OSN environments for performing unauthorized and nefarious activities. Socioware can be an executable, an extension, an exploit code, etc., that conducts malicious operations in OSNs with serious impact on users. Furthermore, we discuss the socioware taxonomy highlighting the characteristics of socioware to illustrate the design and exploitation tactics of OSN malware. In contrast, insider threats (employees or contractors) are posing a grave threat to organizations, with a motivation to steal critical data and monetize it for financial gains. Insider threats have become a serious concern for many organizations today. We present a complete attack model to demonstrate how an insider threat exploits the online trust and confidentiality by transforming an OSN into a socioware distribution platform that infects other employees' systems. Finally, we discuss security defenses that can be adopted to defend against socioware.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923618231

By exploiting the vulnerabilities in cyber components and intruding into the local area networks of the control center, corporation, substations, or by injecting false information into communication links, the attackers are able to eavesdrop critical data, reconfigure devices, and send trip commands to the intelligent electronic devices that control the system breakers. Reliability of the power system can thus be impacted by various cyber attacks. In this paper, four attack scenarios for cyber components in networks of the SCADA system are considered, which may trip breakers of physical components. Two Bayesian attack graph models are built to illustrate the attack procedures and to evaluate the probabilities of successful cyber attacks. A mean time-to-compromise model is modified and adopted considering the known and zero-day vulnerabilities on the cyber components, and the frequencies of intrusions through various paths are estimated. With increased breaker trips resulting from the cyber attacks, the loss of load probabilities in the IEEE reliability test system 79 are estimated. The simulation results demonstrate that the power system becomes less reliable as the frequency of successful attacks on the cyber components increases and the skill levels of attackers increase.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923596085

Hospital staff is key members to develop health information systems, because they play not only a major role in the management of system, but also in the development, implementation and evaluation of the system. Since the evaluation of information systems is not possible without analyzing of the experiences and users' views, thus the aim of this study was to explore nurses' experiences of the hospital information systems. Methods & Materials: In this qualitative study, we investigated the nurses' experiences of the application of hospital information systems for the rich and deep understanding of the phenomenon. The conventional content analysis was used to collect and analyze the data. Face-to-face and semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants to achieve full saturated information. Saturation was achieved with 18 interviews. Results: The emerging themes were gradual system evolution,, audit and responsibility, security, effectiveness and accessibility. Conclusion: Nurses' experiences were positive with the applying of the Health Information Systems. The negative experiences of the nurses were related with the application of the system and redundant work, not the system itself. Regarding to participants need, it is recommended that the system should be extended to other duties such as reporting; so that more effective use of the system in order to improve the quality. © 2014 Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS).

The wireless charging takes place in the ordinary repository for the vests, such as in a wardrobe or a coat rack, without requiring any specific actions from the user. The developed sensor vest provides information about the location and well-being of children, based on received signal strength indication, global positioning system, accelerometer, and temperature sensors. This paper also discusses the experiences of the “safety service for children” school pilot, which utilized various sensors with end-to-end applications.

The very features of packet traffic, like packet lengths statistics, inter-packet times, volumes of exchanged traffic, communication patterns, leak information. Leakage ranges from the kind of application that generates the information flow carried into the supposedly secure connection to parts of its content. We propose traffic masking as a countermeasure. Full confidentiality protection is discussed and the traffic masking framework is introduced and motivated. The optimization and performance assessment of the masking device is evaluated both through a general analytical model, mainly useful to gain basic insight, and by a real network emulation of a distributed secure multiparty computation application, where confidentiality requirements are key to the application itself. It is shown that essentially full confidentiality can be attained for a practical distributed security application by accepting an increase of the traffic volume by a factor 2.4 and an increase of the task completion time of 30%. Hence, (almost) full privacy appears to be more appealing for contexts where delay constraints are more valuable than bandwidth. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Although several ECC-based 2PAKA protocols using either public key infrastructure (PKI) or Identity-based cryptosystem (IBC) have been proposed recently, they suffer from certain limitations. For instance, the former requires heavy computation and management of public key certificate (PKC) and the latter induces a private key escrow problem as the private key is generated by a trusted third party, called private key generator (PKG). Also the man-in-the-middle attack may occur from a malicious PKG and the resilience against such an attack for an authenticated key agreement protocol is needed. In this paper, we proposed the design of a 2PAKA protocol using ECC and SC-PKC that removes all the limitations as mentioned above. In SC-PKC, a trusted third party, called system authority (SA) generates the public key of a user based on user identity signed by SA and user generated signature based on the private key of the user. The proposed scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model under the Computational Diffie–Hellman assumption. Also the formal security validation of our scheme using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications software is done and simulation results prove that it is safe against both the active and passive adversaries. In addition, our protocol is computationally efficient and may be considered as an alternative of the PKI- or IBC-based 2PAKA protocol. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Authenticated key agreement; AVISPA tool; Elliptic curve; Random oracle model; Self-certified public key",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922496474

In this paper, we present that reconfigurable computing is further a critical technology for achieving hardware security in the presence of supply chain adversaries. Specifically, reconfigurable implementation of a given logic function achieves design obfuscation, while reconfiguration for difference logic functions further achieves moving target defense. We further present reconfigurable reversible computing-based cryptography, and a generic reconfiguration-based VLSI design-for-security methodology.In our case studies based on a SPARC V8 LEON2 processor, we prevent software- or hardware-based code injection attacks at cost of 0.72% area increase, negligible power consumption increase and no performance degradation; we further prevent a hardware Trojan from gaining unauthorized memory access at cost of 4.42% area increase, negligible power consumption increase, and 11.30% critical path delay increase.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922715997

The automatic system uses the real-time system state to determine critical flowgates, and then a continuation power flow-based security analysis is used to compute the initial transfer capability of critical flowgates. Next, the system applies the Monte Carlo simulations to expected short-term operating condition changes, feature selection, and a linear least squares fitting of the fine operating rules. The proposed system was validated both on an academic test system and on a provincial power system in China. The results indicated that the derived rules provide accuracy and good interpretability and are suitable for real-time power system security control. The use of high-performance computing systems enables these fine operating rules to be refreshed online every 15 min.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922739682

However, despite the study on intrinsic topological vulnerabilities to node removals, little is known on the network robustness when network defense mechanisms are implemented, especially for networked engineering systems equipped with detection capabilities. In this paper, a sequential defense mechanism is first proposed in complex networks for attack inference and vulnerability assessment, where the data fusion center sequentially infers the presence of an attack based on the binary attack status reported from the nodes in the network. The network robustness is evaluated in terms of the ability to identify the attack prior to network disruption under two major attack schemes, i.e., random and intentional attacks. We provide a parametric plug-in model for performance evaluation on the proposed mechanism and validate its effectiveness and reliability via canonical complex network models and real-world large-scale network topology. The results show that the sequential defense mechanism greatly improves the network robustness and mitigates the possibility of network disruption by acquiring limited attack status information from a small subset of nodes in the network. © 2015 American Physical Society.",,"Lewis, T.G., (2008) Network Science: Theory and Practice, , (John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York); Albert, R., Barabási, A.-L., Statistical mechanics of complex networks (2002) Rev.
