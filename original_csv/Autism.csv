Rodent offspring exposed prenatally to VPA shows autism-related behavioral abnormalities. The present study examined the effect of prenatal VPA exposure on brain monoamine neurotransmitter systems in male and female mice. The prenatal VPA exposure did not affect the levels of dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA), serotonin (5-HT) and their metabolites in the prefrontal cortex and striatum, while it significantly reduced methamphetamine (METH) (1.0mg/kg)-induced hyperlocomotion in male offspring. In vivo microdialysis study demonstrated that prenatal VPA exposure attenuated METH-induced increases in extracellular DA levels in the prefrontal cortex, while it did not affect those in extracellular NA and 5-HT levels. Prenatal VPA exposure also decreased METH-induced c-Fos expression in the prefrontal cortex and the mRNA levels of DA D<inf>1</inf> and D<inf>2</inf> receptors in the prefrontal cortex. These effects of VPA were not observed in the striatum. In contrast to male offspring, prenatal VPA exposure did not affect METH-induced increases in locomotor activity and prefrontal DA levels and the D<inf>1</inf> and D<inf>2</inf> receptor mRNA levels in the prefrontal cortex in female offspring. These findings suggest that prenatal VPA exposure causes hypofunction of prefrontal DA system in a sex-dependent way. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Autism model; Dopamine; Methamphetamine; Prefrontal cortex;

And the factors which generally cause raised IQ, in extreme levels cause autism. The antiinnatia theory further proposed that molecules randomly part-time binding to DNA and thereby reducing gene-expression would cause autism (and in less high levels cause raised IQ). Studies have found that mercury binds dose-dependently to DNA thereby reducing gene-expression, and thus the theory predicts that mercury pollution would cause raised IQ (such as the Flynn effect). This appears contrary to the standard assumption that mercury pollution causes decrements of IQ. In this study, data from the Upper Fremont glacier finds considerable overall correspondence between changes of mercury pollution and changes of IQ. In respect of both mercury and IQ there was roughly-speaking 100. years of increase followed by 15. years of decrease in at least five countries. But mercury pollution is likely to be causing serious harms other than decrements of population averages of IQ. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Air pollution; Autism; Flynn effect; IQ; Mercury","Ariza, M.E., Holliday, J., Williams, M.V., Mutagenic effect of mercury (II) in eukaryotic cells (1994) In Vivo, 8, pp. 5590-5593; Axelrad, D.A., Bellinger, D.C., Ryan, L.M., Woodruff, T.J., Dose-response relationship of prenatal mercury exposure and IQ: An integrative analysis of epidemiologic data (2007) Environmental Health Perspectives, 115 (4), pp. 609-615; Biester, H., Bindler, R., Martinez-Cortizas, A., Modeling the past atmospheric deposition of mercury using natural archives (2007) Environmental Science and Technology, 41, pp. 4851-4860; Clarke, R.P.M., A theory of general impairment of gene-expression manifesting as autism (1993) Personality and Individual Differences, 14, pp. 465-482. , http://autism-causes.org, Available from; Crump, K.S., Kjellstrom, T., Shipp, A.M., Silvers, A., Stewart, A., Influence of prenatal mercury exposure upon scholastic and psychological test performance: Benchmark analysis of a New Zealand cohort (1998) Risk Analysis, 18, pp. 701-713; Davidson, P.W., Myers, G.J., Cox, C., Axtell, C., Shamlaye, C., Sloane-Reeves, J., Effects of prenatal and postnatal methylmercury exposure from fish consumption on neurodevelopment: Outcomes at 66 months of age in the Seychelles Child Development Study (1998) JAMA, 280, pp. 701-707; Dawson, M., Soulières, I., Gernsbacher, M.A., Mottron, L., The level and nature of autistic intelligence (2007) Psychological Science, 18, pp. 657-662; Dickens, W.T., Flynn, J.R., Heritability estimates versus large environmental effects: The IQ paradox resolved (2001) Psychological Review, 108, pp. 346-369; Dutton, E., Lynn, R., A negative Flynn effect in Finland, 1997-2009 (2013) Intelligence, 41, pp. 817-820; Flynn, J.R., Requiem for nutrition as the cause of IQ gains: Raven's gains in Britain 1938-2008 (2009) Economics and Human Biology, 7, pp. 18-27; Flynn, J.R., (2009) What is intelligence?, , Cambridge University Press; Goyer, R.A., Toxic effects of metals (1991) Casarett and Doull's toxicology: The basic science of poisons, pp. 623-680. , McGraw-Hill Inc., New York, M.O.

Recent research has shown that visual, auditory, or audiovisual stimuli can elicit transient pupil dilation, and the timing and size of the evoked responses are systematically modulated by stimulus salience. Moreover, weak microstimulation of the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure involved in eye movements and attention, evokes similar transient pupil dilation, suggesting that the SC coordinates the orienting response which includes transient pupil dilation. Projections from the SC to the pupil control circuitry provide a novel neural substrate underlying pupil modulation by various cognitive processes. © 2015.",,"Loewenfeld, I.E., (1999) The Pupil: Anatomy, Physiology, and Clinical Applications, , Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston; Campbell, F.W., Gregory, A.H., Effect of size of pupil on visual acuity (1960) Nature, 187, pp. 1121-1123; Laughlin, S.B., Retinal information capacity and the function of the pupil (1992) Ophthalmic Physiol Opt, 12, pp. 161-164; Beatty, J., Task-evoked pupillary responses, processing load, and the structure of processing resources (1982) Psychol Bull, 91, pp. 276-292; de Gee, J.W., Knapen, T., Donner, T.H., Decision-related pupil dilation reflects upcoming choice and individual bias (2014) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 111, pp. E618-E625; Einhauser, W., Stout, J., Koch, C., Carter, O., Pupil dilation reflects perceptual selection and predicts subsequent stability in perceptual rivalry (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 105, pp. 1704-1709; Eldar, E., Cohen, J.D., Niv, Y., The effects of neural gain on attention and learning (2013) Nat Neurosci, 16, pp. 1146-1153; Goldinger, S.D., Papesh, M.H., Pupil dilation reflects the creation and retrieval of memories (2012) Curr Dir Psychol Sci, 21, pp. 90-95; Naber, M., Frassle, S., Rutishauser, U., Einhauser, W., Pupil size signals novelty and predicts later retrieval success for declarative memories of natural scenes (2013) J Vis, 13, pp. 1-20; Nassar, M.R., Rumsey, K.M., Wilson, R.C., Parikh, K., Heasly, B., Gold, J.I., Rational regulation of learning dynamics by pupil-linked arousal systems (2012) Nat Neurosci, 15, pp. 1040-1046; Privitera, C.M., Renninger, L.W., Carney, T., Klein, S., Aguilar, M., Pupil dilation during visual target detection (2010) J Vis, 10, pp. 1-14. , 3; Wierda, S.M., van Rijn, H., Taatgen, N.A., Martens, S., Pupil dilation deconvolution reveals the dynamics of attention at high temporal resolution (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 109, pp. 8456-8460; Lynn, R., (1966) Attention, arousal and the orientation reaction, , Pergamon Press, Oxford, UK; Sokolov, E.N., Higher nervous functions; the orienting reflex (1963) Annu Rev Physiol, 25, pp. 545-580; Carrasco, M., Visual attention: the past 25 years (2011) Vis Res, 51, pp. 1484-1525; Kowler, E., Eye movements: the past 25 years (2011) Vis Res, 51, pp. 1457-1483; Netser, S., Ohayon, S., Gutfreund, Y., Multiple manifestations of microstimulation in the optic tectum: eye movements, pupil dilations, and sensory priming (2010) J Neurophysiol, 104, pp. 108-118; Wang, C.A., Boehnke, S.E., Itti, L., Munoz, D.P., Transient pupil response is modulated by contrast-based saliency (2014) J Neurosci, 34, pp. 408-417; Wang, C.A., Munoz, D.P., Modulation of stimulus contrast on the human pupil orienting response (2014) Eur J Neurosci, 40, pp. 2822-2832; Nieuwenhuis, S., De Geus, E.J., Aston-Jones, G., The anatomical and functional relationship between the P3 and autonomic components of the orienting response (2011) Psychophysiology, 48, pp. 162-175; Gandhi, N.J., Katnani, H.A., Motor functions of the superior colliculus (2011) Annu Rev Neurosci, 34, pp. 205-231; Krauzlis, R.J., Lovejoy, L.P., Zenon, A., Superior colliculus and visual spatial attention (2013) Annu Rev Neurosci, 36, pp. 165-182; Netser, S., Dutta, A., Gutfreund, Y., Ongoing activity in the optic tectum is correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with the pupil dilation response (2014) J Neurophysiol, 111, pp. 918-929; Wang, C.A., Boehnke, S.E., White, B.J., Munoz, D.P., Microstimulation of the monkey superior colliculus induces pupil dilation without evoking saccades (2012) J Neurosci, 32, pp. 3629-3636; Szabadi, E., Modulation of physiological reflexes by pain: role of the locus coeruleus (2012) Front Integr Neurosci, 6, p. 94; Gamlin, P.D., The pretectum: connections and oculomotor-related roles (2006) Prog Brain Res, 151, pp. 379-405; Sara, S.J., Bouret, S., Orienting and reorienting: the locus coeruleus mediates cognition through arousal (2012) Neuron, 76, pp. 130-141; Rajkowski, J., Kubiak, P., Aston-Jones, G., Correlations between locus coeruleus (LC) neural activity, pupil diameter and behavior in monkey support a role of LC in attention (1993) Soc Neurosci Abstr, 19, p. 974; Hou, R.H., Freeman, C., Langley, R.W., Szabadi, E., Bradshaw, C.M., Does modafinil activate the locus coeruleus in man?

Hence the factor ""age"" may be taken as strategic tool to analyse specific scientific hypotheses. Additionally, this finding also needs to be addressed in rather pragmatically performed breeding protocols of model organisms, since otherwise artefacts may challenge the validity of the results.Our study was performed to investigate influences of advanced age of mouse dams (30 vs. 16. weeks) on maternal- and offspring behaviour. Adult offspring of both sexes was analysed in a test battery comprising paradigms for exploration, anxiety and depressive-like behaviours. Final blood sampling was conducted for stressphysiological analysis.Interestingly, advanced age of the mothers was associated with increased nest-building quality while maternal activity was unaffected. Moreover ""maternal (mice) age"" (MA) affected emotionality in the offspring, which became apparent in the dark-light box and the social recognition paradigm.These findings not only emphasize MA to model a potent risk factor with regard to emotional stability, but also underscore the vast necessity to include information about breeding protocols into the methods section of any animal study. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.","Age; Emotionality; Maternal environment; Mice; Sociality","Vierck, E., Silverman, J.M., Brief report: phenotypic differences and their relationship to paternal age and gender in autism spectrum disorder (2014) J.

FXS is caused by loss of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, whose fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) regulates mRNA translation downstream of synaptic activity to modulate changes in synaptic architecture, function and plasticity. FXS is one of the known causes of autism and there is no effective treatment that corrects the deficit in FMRP. However, new advances in the knowledge of the molecular pathophysiology of FXS have opened different strategies for the future development of effective drugs. Among the emerging targets are several protein kinases, neuronal calcium sensors, muscarinic receptors, potassium channels, endocannabinoid system, etc. Moreover, some small molecules such statins, antioxidants, glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitors among others have showed an improved in cognition and behavioral tests in FXS mouse model emerging as promising drug candidates for FXS pharmacological treatment in the next future. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Kidd, S.A., Lachiewicz, A., Barbouth, D., Blitz, R.K., Delahunty, C., McBrien, D., Visootsak, J., Berry-Kravis, E., Fragile X syndrome: a review of associated medical problems (2014) Pediatrics, 134, pp. 995-1005; Verkerk, A.J., Pieretti, M., Sutcliffe, J.S., Fu, Y.H., Kuhl, D.P., Pizzuti, A., Reiner, O., Zhang, F.P., Identification of a gene (FMR-1) containing a CGG repeat coincident with a breakpoint cluster region exhibiting length variation in fragile X syndrome (1991) Cell, 65, pp. 905-914; Wang, T., Bray, S.M., Warren, S.T., New perspectives on the biology of fragile X syndrome (2012) Curr Opin Genet Dev, 22, pp. 256-263; Penagarikano, O., Mulle, J.G., Warren, S.T., The pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome (2007) Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet, 8, pp. 109-129; Crawford, D.C., Acuna, J.M., Sherman, S.L., FMR1 and the fragile X syndrome: human genome epidemiology review (2001) Genet Med, 3, pp. 359-371; Rousseau, F., Rouillard, P., Morel, M.L., Khandjian, E.W., Morgan, K., Prevalence of carriers of premutation-size alleles of the FMRI gene - and implications for the population genetics of the fragile X syndrome (1995) Am J Hum Genet, 57, pp. 1006-1018; Hunter, J., Rivero-Arias, O., Angelov, A., Kim, E., Fotheringham, I., Leal, J., Epidemiology of fragile X syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis (2014) Am J Med Genet A, 164, pp. 1648-1658; Hagerman, R.J., Des-Portes, V., Gasparini, F., Jacquemont, S., Gomez-Mancilla, B., Translating molecular advances in fragile X syndrome into therapy: a review (2014) J Clin Psychiatry, 75, pp. e294-e307; Kim, M., Ceman, S., Fragile X mental retardation protein: past, present and future (2012) Curr Protein Pept Sci, 13, pp. 358-371; De Boulle, K., Verkerk, A.J., Reyniers, E., Vits, L., Hendrickx, J., Van Roy, B., Van den Bos, F., Willems, P.J., A point mutation in the FMR-1 gene associated with fragile X mental retardation (1993) Nat Genet, 3, pp. 31-35; Wang, Y.C., Lin, M.L., Lin, S.J., Li, Y.C., Li, S.Y., Novel point mutation within intron 10 of FMR-1 gene causing fragile X syndrome (1997) Hum Mutat, 10, pp. 393-399; Valverde, R., Pozdnyakova, I., Kajander, T., Venkatraman, J., Regan, L., Fragile X mental retardation syndrome: structure of the KH1-KH2 domains of fragile X mental retardation protein (2007) Structure, 15, pp. 1090-1098; Verheij, C., de Graaff, E., Bakker, C.E., Willemsen, R., Willems, P.J., Meijer, N., Galjaard, H., Hoogeveen, A.T., Characterization of FMR1 proteins isolated from different tissues (1995) Hum Mol Genet, 4, pp. 895-901; Feng, Y., Absher, D., Eberhart, D.E., Brown, V., Malter, H.E., Warren, S.T., FMRP associates with polyribosomes as an mRNP, and the I304N mutation of severe fragile X syndrome abolishes this association (1997) Mol Cell, 1, pp. 109-118; Darnell, J.C., Fraser, C.E., Mostovetsky, O., Stefani, G., Jones, T.A., Eddy, S.R., Darnell, R.B., Kissing complex RNAs mediate interaction between the Fragile-X mental retardation protein KH2 domain and brain polyribosomes (2005) Genes Dev, 19, pp. 903-918; Collins, S.C., Bray, S.M., Suhl, J.A., Cutler, D.J., Coffee, B., Zwick, M.E., Warren, S.T., Identification of novel FMR1 variants by massively parallel sequencing in developmentally delayed males (2010) Am J Med Genet A, 152 A, pp. 2512-2520; McConkie-Rosell, A., Lachiewicz, A.M., Spiridigliozzi, G.A., Tarleton, J., Schoenwald, S., Phelan, M.C., Goonewardena, P., Brown, W.T., Evidence that methylation of the FMR-I locus is responsible for variable phenotypic expression of the fragile X syndrome (1993) Am J Hum Genet, 53, pp. 800-809; Loesch, D.Z., Huggins, R.M., Hagerman, R.J., Phenotypic variation and FMRP levels in fragile X (2004) Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev, 10, pp. 31-41; Garber, K.B., Warren, S.T., Visootsak, J., Fragile X syndrome and X-linked intellectual disability (2013) Emery and Rimoin's principles and practice of medical genetics, pp. 1-27. , Academic Press, [chapter 107], D.

Prior studies have separately investigated social processing and executive function in autism, but little is known about the brain mechanisms of cognitive control for both emotional and nonemotional stimuli. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify differences in neurocircuitry between individuals with high functioning autism (HFA) and neurotypical controls during two versions of a go/no-go task: emotional (fear and happy faces) and nonemotional (English letters). During the letter task, HFA participants showed hypoactivation in the ventral prefrontal cortex. During the emotion task, happy faces elicited activation in the ventral striatum, nucleus accumbens and anterior amygdala in neurotypical, but not HFA, participants. Response inhibition for fear faces compared with happy faces recruited occipitotemporal regions in HFA, but not neurotypical, participants. In a direct contrast of emotional no-go and letter no-go blocks, HFA participants showed hyperactivation in extrastriate cortex and fusiform gyrus. Accuracy for emotional no-go trials was negatively correlated with activation in fusiform gyrus in the HFA group. These results indicate that autism is associated with abnormal processing in socioemotional brain networks, and support the theory that autism is marked by a social motivational deficit. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Autism spectrum disorder;

Interestingly, the severity of the intellectual disability in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex may relate more to this metabolic disturbance (i.e., overactivity of mTOR signaling) than the density of cortical tubers. Several recent reports showed that rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1, improved sociability and other symptoms in mouse models of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and autism spectrum disorder, consistent with mTORC1 overactivity playing an important pathogenic role. NMDA receptor activation may also dampen mTORC1 activity by at least two possible mechanisms: regulating intraneuronal accumulation of arginine and the phosphorylation status of a specific extracellular signal regulating kinase (i.e., ERK1/2), both of which are ""drivers"" of mTORC1 activity. Conceivably, the prosocial effects of targeting the NMDA receptor with agonists in mouse models of autism spectrum disorders result from their ability to dampen mTORC1 activity in neurons. Strategies for dampening mTORC1 overactivity by NMDA receptor activation may be preferred to its direct inhibition in chronic neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","D-Cycloserine; mTOR; NMDA receptor; Sociability; Tuberous sclerosis","Benson, A.D., Burket, J.A., Deutsch, S.I., Balb/c mice treated with D-cycloserine arouse increased social interest in conspecifics (2013) Brain Res Bull, 99, pp. 95-99. , [Oct]; Billingslea, E.N., Tatard-Leitman, V.M., Anguiano, J., Jutzeler, C.R., Suh, J., Saunders, J.A., Parvalbumin cell ablation of NMDA-R1 causes increased resting network excitability with associated social and self-care deficits (2014) Neuropsychopharmacol Off Publ Am Coll Neuropsychopharmacol, 39 (7), pp. 1603-1613. , [Jun]; Brodkin, E.S., BALB/c mice: low sociability and other phenotypes that may be relevant to autism (2007) Behav Brain Res, 176 (1), pp. 53-65. , [Jan 10]; Brodkin, E.S., Social behavior phenotypes in fragile X syndrome, autism, and the Fmr1 knockout mouse: theoretical comment on McNaughton et al.

The ASD is defined as a neurodevelopmental disorder that disrupts normal patterns of connectivity between the brain regions. Therefore, the potential use of such abnormality for autism screening is investigated. The connectivity patterns are estimated from electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from 8 brain regions under various mental states. The EEG data of 12 healthy controls and 6 autistic children (age matched in 7-10) were collected during eyes-open and eyes-close resting states as well as when subjects were exposed to affective faces (happy, sad and calm). Subsequently, the subjects were classified as autistic or healthy groups based on their brain connectivity patterns using pattern recognition techniques. Performance of the proposed system in each mental state is separately evaluated. The results present higher recognition rates using functional connectivity features when compared against other existing feature extraction methods. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Affective face perception; Autism screening; Connectivity feature; EEG; Pattern recognition","(2007) ICD-10 International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems:10th Revision, , World Health Organization second ed.

Moreover, there is a high risk of relapse and developing a chronic illness. Randomized-controlled trails (RCT), the gold-standard for evaluating treatments, show treatments to be efficacious, yet little is known about their generalizability and long-term durability in ""usual-care"" settings. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of evidence-based pediatric OCD-treatments in regular practice. Participants were 109 children (aged 7-17 years) with a primary diagnosis of OCD, recruited from a specialized OCD-clinic in Sweden. Few exclusion criteria were applied. The youths were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months following the first assessment, using Childre's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and Children's OCD Impact Scale. They were treated with Cognitive Behavior Therapy, augmented with SSRI when indicated. The majority responded well to treatment i.e. were free from OCD or in remission at 12 month evaluation. Moreover, the participants psychosocial functioning significantly improved from baseline to evaluation at 6 and 12 months. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Childhood adolescence; Naturalistic study; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Outcome; Treatment","Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (2012) Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 51 (1), pp. 98-113; Abramowitz, J.S., Whiteside, S.P., Deacon, B.J., The effectiveness of treatment for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder: a meta-analysis (2005) Behavior Therapy, 36 (1), pp. 55-63; Achenbach, T., (1991) Manual for the child behavior checklist/4-18 and 1991 profile, , University of Vermont, Department of Psychiatry, Burlington, VT; (1994) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV), 4. , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC; Busner, J., Targum, S.D., The clinical global impressions scale: applying a research tool in clinical practice (2007) Psychiatry (Edgmont), 4 (7), pp. 28-37; Ehlers, S., Gillberg, C., Wing, L., A screening questionnaire for Asperger syndrome and other high-functioning autism spectrum disorders in school age children (1999) Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 29 (2), pp. 129-141; Fitzmaurice, G.M., Laird, N.M., Ware, J.H., (2011) Applied longitudinal analysis, , Wiley, Hoboken, NJ; Gallant, J., Storch, E.A., Merlo, L.J., Ricketts, E.D., Geffken, G.R., Goodman, W.K., Murphy, T.K., Convergent and discriminant validity of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-Symptom Checklist (2008) Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 22 (8), pp. 1369-1376; Geller, D.A., Biederman, J., Griffin, S., Jones, J., Lefkowitz, T.R., Comorbidity of juvenile obsessive-compulsive disorder with disruptive behavior disorders (1996) Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 35 (12), pp. 1637-1646; Geller, D.A., Biederman, J., Stewart, S.E., Mullin, B., Martin, A., Spencer, T., Faraone, S.V., Which SSRI?

No effective treatment yet exists for autism. Therefore, we used our rat model to test a possible treatment for autism. We selected zinc as the prenatal treatment to prevent or ease the impairments induced by LPS because LPS induces hypozincaemia. Materials andmethods:We evaluated the effects of LPS and zinc on female reproductive performance. Communication, which is impaired in autism,was tested in pups by ultrasonic vocalizations. Plasma levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were determined because it has been considered an autism important biomarker. Key findings: Prenatal LPS exposure reduced offspring number and treatmentwith zinc prevented this reduction. Moreover, pups that were prenatally exposed to LPS spent longer periods without calling their mothers, and posttreatment with zinc prevented this impairment induced by LPS to the same levels as controls. Prenatal LPS also increased BDNF levels in adult offspring, and posttreatment with zinc reduced the elevation of BDNF to the same levels as controls. Significance: BDNF hyperactivity was also found in several studies of autistic patients. Togetherwith our previous studies, our model of prenatal LPS induced autistic-like behavioral, brain, and immune disturbances. This suggests that it is a valid rat model of autism. Prenatal zinc prevented reproductive, communication, and BDNF impairments. The present study revealed a potential beneficial effect of prenatal zinc administration for the prevention of autism with regard to the BDNF pathway. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We genotyped a large set of healthy individuals for loci that represent established genetic indicators of serum testosterone and oxytocin levels, and tested for associations of these genetic indices of hormone levels with self-report measures of autistic and schizotypal cognition. A low genetic index of testosterone, a high genetic index of oxytocin, and/or a low ratio of testosterone to oxytocin indices were positively correlated with high imagination (by the Autism Quotient) and high positive and total schizotypy (by the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire). The genetic indices for oxytocin, and testosterone relative to oxytocin, also showed significant correlations with a metric of positive schizotypy relative to autism, implicating higher oxytocin and lower testosterone in increased positively-schizotypal traits combined with decreased autism-associated traits.

To the contrary, astaxanthin shows neuroprotective effect by its antioxidant mechanism. We aimed to (i) develop mice model of autism and (ii) investigate the effect of astaxanthin on such model animals.Valproic acid (600. mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally to the pregnant mice on gestational day 12.5. Prenatal valproic acid-exposed mice were divided into 2 groups on postnatal day 25 and astaxanthin (2. mg/kg) was given to the experimental group (VPA_AST, n=. 10) while saline was given to the control group (VPA, n=. 10) for 4 weeks. Behavioral test including social interaction, open field and hot-plate were conducted on postnatal day 25 and oxidative stress markers such as lipid peroxidation, advanced protein oxidation product, nitric oxide, glutathione, and activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase were estimated on postnatal day 26 to confirm mice model of autism and on postnatal day 56 to assess the effect of astaxanthin.On postnatal day 25, prenatal valproic acid-exposed mice exhibited (i) delayed eye opening (ii) longer latency to respond painful stimuli, (iii) poor sociability and social novelty and (iv) high level of anxiety. In addition, an increased level of oxidative stress was found by determining different oxidative stress markers. Treatment with astaxanthin significantly (. p<. 0.05) improved the behavioral disorder and reduced the oxidative stress in brain and liver.In conclusion, prenatal exposure to valproic day in pregnant mice leads to the development of autism-like features. Astaxanthin improves the impaired behavior in animal model of autism presumably by its antioxidant activity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Astaxanthin; Autism; Oxidative stress; Valproic acid","Faras, H., Al Ateeqi, N., Tidmarsh, L., Autism spectrum disorders (2010) Ann Saudi Med, 30, pp. 295-300; Rapin, I., Tuchman, R.F., Autism: definition, neurobiology, screening, diagnosis (2008) Pediatr Clin North Am, 55, pp. 1129-1146. , viii; (2013) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , American Psychiatric Publishing, Arlington, VA; Patterson, P.H., Modeling autistic features in animals (2011) Pediatr Res, 69, pp. 34R-40R; Banji, D., Banji, O.J., Abbagoni, S., Hayath, M.S., Kambam, S., Chiluka, V.L., Amelioration of behavioural aberrations and oxidative markers by green tea extract in valproate induced autism in animals (2011) Brain Res, 1410, pp. 141-151; Bromley, R.L., Mawer, G., Clayton-Smith, J., Baker, G.A., Autism spectrum disorders following in utero exposure to antiepileptic drugs (2008) Neurology, 71, pp. 1923-1924; Bromley, R.L., Mawer, G., Love, J., Kelly, J., Purdy, L., McEwan, L., Early cognitive development in children born to women with epilepsy: a prospective report (2010) Epilepsia, 51, pp. 2058-2065; Martin, H.G., Manzoni, O.J., Late onset deficits in synaptic plasticity in the valproic acid rat model of autism (2014) Front Cell Neurosci, 8, p. 23; Cohen, O.S., Varlinskaya, E.I., Wilson, C.A., Glatt, S.J., Mooney, S.M., Acute prenatal exposure to a moderate dose of valproic acid increases social behaviour and alters gene expression in rats (2013) Int J Dev Neurosci, 31, pp. 740-750; Bambini-Junior, V., Zanatta, G., Della Flora Nunes, G., Mueller de Melo, G., Michels, M., Dutra, M., Resveratrol prevents autistic-like social deficits in animal model induced by valproic acid (2014) Neurosci Lett; Bambini-Junior, V., Rodrigues, L., Behr, G.A., Moreira, J.C., Riesgo, R., Gottfried, C., Animal model of autism induced by prenatal exposure to valproate: behavioural changes and liver parameters (2011) Brain Res, 1408, pp. 8-16; Schneider, T., Przewlocki, R., Behavioural alterations in rats prenatally exposed to valproic acid: animal model of autism (2005) Neuropsychopharmacology, 30, pp. 80-89; Schneider, T., Roman, A., Basta-Kaim, A., Kubera, M., Budziszewska, B., Schneider, K., Gender-specific behavioural and immunological alterations in an animal model of autism induced by prenatal exposure to valproic acid (2008) Psychoneuroendocrinology, 33, pp. 728-740; Schneider, T., Labuz, D., Przewlocki, R., Nociceptive changes in rats after prenatal exposure to valproic acid (2001) Pol J Pharmacol, 53, pp. 531-534; Sandhya, T., Sowjanya, J., Veeresh, B., Bacopa monniera (L.)

ASD has a strong genetic basis, but until recently, a large fraction of the genetic factors contributing to liability was still unknown. Over the past 3 years, high-throughput next-generation sequencing on large cohorts has exposed a heterogeneous and complex genetic landscape and has revealed novel risk genes. Here, we provide an overview of the recent advances on the ASD genetic architecture, with an emphasis on the estimates of heritability, the contribution of common variants, and the role of inherited and de novo rare variation. We also examine the genetic components of the reported gender bias. Finally, we discuss the emerging findings from sequencing studies and how they illuminate crucial aspects of ASD pathophysiology. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Autism risk genes; Autism spectrum disorder; Copy number variation; De novo variation; Exome sequencing; Heritability","Levy, S.E., Mandell, D.S., Schultz, R.T., Autism (2009) Lancet, 374, pp. 1627-1638. , PID: 19819542; Jacquemont S, Coe BP, Hersch M, Duyzend MH, Krumm N, Bergmann S, et al.

Children with SLI, children with ASD, and typically developing children (n= 27 per group) between 8 and 13. years of age were matched in triplets for age and nonverbal reasoning. Participants were taught 12 mappings between novel phonological strings and referents; half of these mappings were trained with orthography present and half were trained with orthography absent. Groups did not differ on the ability to learn new oral vocabulary, although there was some indication that children with ASD were slower than controls to identify newly learned items. During training, the ASD, SLI, and typically developing groups benefited from orthography to the same extent. In supplementary analyses, children with SLI were matched in pairs to an additional control group of younger typically developing children for nonword reading. Compared with younger controls, children with SLI showed equivalent oral vocabulary acquisition and benefit from orthography during training. Our findings are consistent with current theoretical accounts of how lexical entries are acquired and replicate previous studies that have shown orthographic facilitation for vocabulary acquisition in typically developing children and children with ASD. We demonstrate this effect in SLI for the first time. The study provides evidence that the presence of orthographic cues can support oral vocabulary acquisition, motivating intervention approaches (as well as standard classroom teaching) that emphasize the orthographic form. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Autism spectrum disorders; Orthographic facilitation; Orthography; Specific language impairment; Vocabulary; Vocabulary acquisition; Word learning","Alt, M., Plante, E., Creusere, M., Semantic features in fast-mapping: Performance of preschoolers with specific language impairment versus preschoolers with normal language (2004) Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research, 47, pp. 407-420; (2000) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-fourth edition (DSM-IV), , American Psychiatric Press, Washington, DC; Baird, G., Simonoff, E., Pickles, A., Chandler, S., Loucas, T., Meldrum, D., Charman, T., Prevalence of disorders of the autism spectrum in a population cohort of children in South Thames: The Special Needs and Autism Project (SNAP) (2006) The Lancet, 368 (9531), pp. 210-215; Bishop, D.V.M., McDonald, D., Identifying language impairment in children: Combining language test scores with parental report (2009) International Journal of Language & Communication Disorders, 44, pp. 600-615; Bishop, D.V.M., McDonald, D., Bird, S., Hayiou-Thomas, M.E., Children who read words accurately despite language impairment: Who are they and how do they do it?

It is widely assumed that, since they are explicitly instructed to do, participants use mentalizing in this communicative task; they represent what the director can see, and therefore the DT provides important information about how and when mentalizing is used in adult life. We tested this view against a “submentalizing” hypothesis suggesting that DT performance depends on object-centered spatial coding, without mentalizing. As predicted by the submentalizing account, we found that DT performance was unchanged when the director was replaced by an inanimate object, a camera, and that participants with autism spectrum disorders were unimpaired, relative to matched control participants, in both the director and camera conditions. In combination with recent critical analyses of “implicit mentalizing,” these findings support the view that adults use mentalizing sparingly in psychological experiments and in everyday life. © 2014, Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Autism; Director task; Mentalizing; Object-centered spatial coding; Perspective-taking; Submentalizing","Aichhorn, M., Perner, J., Kronbichler, M., Staffen, W., Ladurner, G., Do visual perspective tasks need theory of mind?

Using the two-stimulus pairing procedure, we examined the emergence of stimulus relations between Japanese and English words by comparing the spelling performance of five students with ASD with that of five typically developing students. In the Japanese-English pairing procedure, a Japanese word was presented first, followed by its English translation, and in the English-Japanese pairing, an English word was presented first, followed by its Japanese translation. Training effects were evaluated with a sign test and analysis of variance. All the students correctly spelled the English words in both procedures. The Japanese-English pairing procedure required fewer training blocks than the English-Japanese pairing procedure. In the Japanese-English pairing, students with ASD required fewer training blocks than typically developing students. These results suggest that presenting already established words (i.e., Japanese) first might better facilitate the emergence of stimulus relations in a stimulus pairing procedure. © 2015, Association for Behavior Analysis International.","Autism spectrum disorders; Spelling; Stimulus pairing procedure; Stimulus relations","Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed (2000) text rev), , Washington, DC: Author; Clayton, M., Hayes, L., A comparison of match-to-sample and respondent-type training of equivalence classes (2004) The Psychological Record, 54, pp. 579-602. , http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/tpr/vol54/iss4/6/, Retrieved from; Cohen, J., Weighted kappa: Nominal scale agreement with provisions for scale disagreement or partial credit (1968) Psychological Bulletin, 70, pp. 313-320; Fields, L., Reeve, K.F., Rosen, D., Varelas, A., Adams, B.J., Belanich, J., Hobbie, S.A., Using the simultaneous protocol to study equivalence class formation: The facilitating effects of nodal number and size of previously established equivalence classes (1997) Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, 67, pp. 367-389. , PID: 16812847; Hayashi, Y., Vaidya, M., Effects of stimulus discriminability on the acquisition of conditional discriminations in adult humans (2008) European Journal of Behavior Analysis, 9, pp. 173-183. , http://www.ejoba.org/PDF/2008_2/Hayashi_Vaidya_2008.pdf, Retrieved from; Holth, P., Arntzen, E., Stimulus familiarity and the delayed emergence of stimulus equivalence or consistent nonequivalence (1998) The Psychological Record, 48, pp. 81-110. , http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/tpr/vol48/iss1/6/, Retrieved from; Kazdin, A.E., (2011) Single-case research designs: Methods for clinical and applied settings, , Oxford University Press, New York, NY:; Leader, G., Barnes-Holmes, D., Matching-to-sample and respondent-type training as methods for producing equivalence relations: Isolating the critical variable (2001) The Psychological Record, 51, pp. 429-444. , http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/tpr/vol51/iss3/5/, Retrieved from; O’Connor, J., Rafferty, A., Barnes-Holmes, D., Barnes-Holmes, Y., The role of verbal behavior, stimulus nameability, and familiarity on the equivalence performances of autistic and normally developing children (2009) The Psychological Record, 59, pp. 53-74. , http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/tpr/vol59/iss1/4/, Retrieved from; Omori, M., Yamamoto, J., Stimulus pairing training for Kanji reading skills in students with developmental disabilities (2013) Research in Developmental Disabilities, 34, pp. 1109-1118. , PID: 23357673; Omori, M., Yamamoto, J., Sequential stimulus pairing procedure for the students with intellectual disabilities (2013) Psychology, 4, pp. 238-245. , http://dx.doi.org/10.4236/psych.2013.43A036, Retrieved from; Petursdottir, A.I., Hafliđadóttir, R.D., A comparison of four strategies for teaching small foreign-language vocabulary (2009) Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 42, pp. 685-690. , PID: 20190929; Rayner, K., Eye movements and attention in reading, scene perception, and visual search (2009) The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 62, pp. 1457-1506. , PID: 19449261; Rosales, R., Rehfeldt, R.A., Huffman, N., Examining the utility of the stimulus pairing observation procedure with preschool children learning a second language (2012) Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 45, pp. 173-177. , PID: 22403462; Serna, R.W., Dube, W.V., McIlvane, W.J., Assessing same/different judgments in individuals with severe intellectual disabilities: A status report (1997) Research in Developmental Disabilities, 18, pp. 343-368. , PID: 9292929; Sherer, M., Pierce, K.L., Paredes, S., Kisacky, K.L., Ingersoll, B., Schreibman, L., Enhancing conversation skills in children with autism via video technology: Which is better, “self” or “other” as a model?

It is characterized by complex behavioral phenotype and deficits in both social and cognitive functions. Although the exact cause of ASD is still not known, the main findings emphasize the role of genetic and environmental factors in the development of autistic behavior. Environmental factors are also likely to interact with the genetic profile and cause aberrant changes in brain growth, neuronal development, and functional connectivity. The past few years have seen an increase in the prevalence of ASD, as a result of enhanced clinical tests and diagnostic tools. Despite growing evidence for the involvement of endogenous biomarkers in the pathophysiology of ASD, early detection of this disorder remains a big challenge. This paper describes the main behavioral and cognitive features of ASD, as well as the symptoms that differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. An attempt will be made to integrate all the available evidence which point to reduced brain connectivity, mirror neurons deficits, and inhibition-excitation imbalance in individuals with ASD. Finally, this review discusses the main factors involved in the pathophysiology of ASD, and illustrates some of the most important markers used for the diagnosis of this debilitating disorder. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Autism spectrum disorder; Behavior; Brain development; Diagnosis; Genetics","Akshoomoff, N., Corsello, C., Schmidt, H., The role of the autism diagnostic observation schedule in the assessment of autism spectrum disorders in school and community settings (2006) Calif.

They thus vary in channel characteristics, as can be taken from comparative black lipid bilayer experiments. Furthermore, the multi-compartment expression makes expect even differing native VDAC-1 molecules. Recent structural work on mammalian VDAC-1 has only used recombinant material, refolded from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies. While this approach established the basic three-dimensional structure of VDAC-1, a ß-barrel set up by nineteen ß-pleated sheets, dissent is on positioning and movements of its free N-terminal helical peptide stretch preceding ß-pleated sheet-1. A synopsis of data concerning posttranslational modifications, cyto-topology and physiology of native VDAC-1, from my point of view, suggests that the finalisation of its three-dimensional structure will need native channel preparations to be studied. Concerning relevance, recent evidence on the regulation of cell membrane-integrated VDAC-1 by posttranslational modifications and proteineous modulators, taken together with experimental demonstrations that VDAC-1 is involved in cell volume regulation, it thus may be part of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway can hopefully help to understand some relevant medical syndromes, e.g. cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease, autism and malaria. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Alzheimers disease; Autism; Cystic fibrosis; Malaria; Porin; VRAC","Tewari, D., Ahmed, T., Chirasani, V.R., Singh, P.S., Maji, S.K., Senapati, S., Bera, A.K., Modulation of the mitochondrial voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC) by curcumin (2014) Biochim.

The striking finding of mutations in the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit gene GRIN2A as the first monogenic cause in up to 20 % of patients with EAS suggests that excitatory glutamate receptors play a key role in these disorders. Patients with GRIN2A mutations have a recognizable speech and language phenotype that may assist with diagnosis. Other molecules involved in RNA binding and cell adhesion have been implicated in EAS; copy number variations are also found.

People mimic what they observe in others, including facial expressions, emotions, behavioral movements, and verbal patterns. In the current review we focus on the causes and consequences of mimicry. Specifically, what causes mimicry to occur within a given social interaction and what are the downstream consequences of such mimicry? We position recent developments in the context of prior findings in order to emphasize the current direction of mimicry research. Then we turn to the role of mimicry in social disorders and discuss how mimicry may underlie social deficits in these disorders. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Lakin, J.L., Chartrand, T.L., Using nonconscious behavioral mimicry to create affiliation and rapport (2003) Psychol Sci, 14, pp. 334-339; Stel, M., Vonk, R., Empathizing via mimicry depends on whether emotional expressions are seen as real (2009) Eur Psychol, 14, pp. 342-350; Van Baaren, R.B., Holland, R.W., Kawakami, K., Van Knippenberg, A., (2004) Mimicry and Prosocial Behavior, , SAGE Publications; Meltzoff, A.N., Moore, M.K., Imitation of facial and manual gestures by human neonates (1977) Science (80-), 198, pp. 75-78; Neal, D.T., Chartrand, T.L., Embodied emotion perception: amplifying and dampening facial feedback modulates emotion perception accuracy (2011) Soc Psychol Pers Sci, 2, pp. 673-678; Ponari, M., Conson, M., D'Amico, N.P., Grossi, D., Trojano, L., Mapping correspondence between facial mimicry and emotion recognition in healthy subjects (2012) Emotion, 12, pp. 1398-1403; Sato, W., Fujimura, T., Kochiyama, T., Suzuki, N., Relationships among facial mimicry, emotional experience, and emotion recognition (2013) PLOS ONE, 8, p. pe57889; Rychlowska, M., Cañadas, E., Wood, A., Krumhuber, E.G., Fischer, A., Niedenthal, P.M., Blocking mimicry makes true and false smiles look the same (2014) PLOS ONE, 9, p. e90876; Krumhuber, E.G., Likowski, K.U., Weyers, P., Facial mimicry of spontaneous and deliberate Duchenne and Non-Duchenne smiles (2014) J Nonverbal Behav, 38, pp. 1-11; Hess, U., Fischer, A., Emotional mimicry as social regulation (2013) Pers Soc Psychol Rev, 17, pp. 142-157; Hess, U., Fischer, A., Emotional mimicry: why and when we mimic emotions (2014) Soc Pers Psychol Compass, 8, pp. 45-57; Fischer, A.H., Becker, D., Veenstra, L., Emotional mimicry in social context: the case of disgust and pride (2012) Front Psychol, 3, pp. 1-9; Chartrand, T.L., Maddux, W.W., Lakin, J.L., Beyond the perception-behavior link: the ubiquitous utility and motivational moderators of nonconscious mimicry (2005) in The new unconscious, pp. 334-361. , Oxford University Press, New York, R.R.

Research on EG and ED is in its infancy; however, as reviewed in this paper, accumulating evidence suggests that EG and ED are associated with psychosocial adjustment. Studies have demonstrated that schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, major depression, autism, and alcohol problems are associated with lower levels of EG/ED. This evidence strongly suggests that EG/ED may represent emotion regulation resources that buffer against the deleterious consequences of negative emotions. Research more clearly establishing the nature and construct validity of EG/ED and more clearly specifying their role in the development of psychosocial adjustment problems is needed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Haidt, J., (2013) The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion, , Random House LLC; (2011) What Neuroscience Tells Us about Morality: Braintrust, , Princeton University Press, P.S.

Reduced RSA and excessive RSA reactivity (i.e., withdrawal) to emotional challenge are observed consistently among individuals with poor ER capabilities, including those with various forms of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, and those with specific psychopathological syndromes, including anxiety, phobias, attention problems, autism, callousness, conduct disorder, depression, non-suicidal self-injury, panic disorder, and trait hostility. Emerging evidence suggests that low RSA and excessive RSA reactivity index poor ER because they are downstream peripheral markers of prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction. Poorly modulated inhibitory efferent pathways from the medial PFC to the PNS result in reduced RSA and excessive RSA reactivity. According to this perspective, RSA is a non-invasive proxy for poor executive control over behavior, which characterizes most forms of psychopathology. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Darwin, C.R., (1872) The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, , John Murray; Beauchaine, T.P., Zalewski, M., Physiological and developmental mechanisms of emotional liability in coercive relationships Oxford Handbook of Coercive Relationship Dynamics, , Edited by Dishion TJ, Snyder JJ, Oxford University Press, in press; Ekman, P., Davidson, R.J., (1994) The Nature of Emotion, , Oxford University Press; (1994) The Development of Emotion Regulation: Biological and Behavioral Considerations, , Monogr Soc Res Child, 59 (2-3, Serial No. 240), N.A.

Recognition memory is disturbed in a range of human disorders and NOR is widely used in rodents for investigating deficits in a variety of animal models of human conditions where cognition is impaired. It possesses several advantages over more complex tasks that involve lengthy training procedures and/or food or water deprivation. It is quick to administer, non-rewarded, provides data quickly, cost effective and most importantly, ethologically relevant as it relies on the animal's natural preference for novelty. A PubMed search revealed over 900 publications in rats and mice using this task over the past 3 years with 34 reviews in the past 10 years, demonstrating its increasing popularity with neuroscientists. Although it is widely used in many disparate areas of research, no articles have systematically examined this to date, which is the subject of our review. We reveal that NOR may be used to study recognition memory deficits that occur in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, where research is extensive, in Parkinson's disease and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) where we observed markedly reduced numbers of publications. In addition, we review the use of NOR to study cognitive deficits induced by traumatic brain injury and cancer chemotherapy, not disorders per se, but situations in which cognitive deficits dramatically reduce the quality of life for those affected, see Fig. 1 for a summary. Our review reveals that, in all these animal models, the NOR test is extremely useful for identification of the cognitive deficits observed, their neural basis, and for testing the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents. Our conclusion is that NOR is of considerable value for cognitive researchers of all disciplines and we anticipate that its use will continue to increase due to its versatility and several other advantages, as detailed in this review. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Alzheimer's disease;

Epidemiological and genetic studies suggest a female protective effect (FPE) may account for part of this bias; however, the mechanism of such protection is unknown. Quantitative assessment of ASD symptoms using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) shows a bimodal distribution unique to females in multiplex families. This leads to the hypothesis that a single, common genetic locus on chromosome X might mediate the FPE and produce the ASD sex bias. Such a locus would represent a major therapeutic target and is likely to have been missed by conventional genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis. Methods: To explore this possibility, we performed an association study in affected versus unaffected females, considering three tiers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as follows: 1) regions of chromosome X that escape X-inactivation, 2) all of chromosome X, and 3) genome-wide. Results: No evidence of a SNP meeting the criteria for a single FPE locus was observed, despite the analysis being well powered to detect this effect. Conclusions: The results do not support the hypothesis that the FPE is mediated by a single genetic locus; however, this does not exclude the possibility of multiple genetic loci playing a role in the FPE. © 2015 Gockley et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Autism spectrum disorder; Female protective effect; GWAS; Sex bias",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929000230

Young Dr. South, Los Angeles, CA, 90095 USA","Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are more prevalent in males, suggesting a multiple threshold liability model in which females are, on average, protected by sex-differential mechanisms. Under this model, autistic females are predicted to carry a more penetrant risk variant load than males and to share this greater genetic liability with their siblings. However, reported ASD recurrence rates have not demonstrated significantly increased risk to siblings of affected girls. Here, we characterize recurrence patterns in multiplex families from the Autism Genetics Resource Exchange (AGRE) to determine if risk in these families follows a female protective model. Methods: We assess recurrence rates and quantitative traits in full siblings from 1,120 multiplex nuclear families and concordance rates in 305 twin pairs from AGRE. We consider the first two affected children per family, and one randomly selected autistic twin per pair, as probands. We then compare recurrence rates and phenotypes between males and females and between twin pairs or families with at least one female proband (female-containing (FC)) versus those with only male probands (male-only (MO)). Results: Among children born after two probands, we observe significantly higher recurrence in males (47.5%) than in females (21.1%; relative risk, RR = 2.25; adjusted P = 6.22e-08) and in siblings of female (44.3%) versus siblings of male probands (30.4%; RR = 1.46; adj. P = 0.036). This sex-differential recurrence is also robust in dizygotic twin pairs (males = 61.5%, females = 19.1%; RR = 3.23; adj. P = 7.66e-09). Additionally, we find a significant negative relationship between interbirth interval and ASD recurrence that is driven by children in MO families. Conclusions: By classifying families as MO or FC using two probands instead of one, we observe significant recurrence rate differences between families harboring sex-differential familial liability. However, a significant sex difference in risk to children within FC families suggests that female protective mechanisms are still operative in families carrying high genetic risk loads. Furthermore, the male-specific relationship between shorter interbirth intervals and increased ASD risk is consistent with a potentially greater contribution from environmental factors in males versus higher genetic risk in affected females and their families. Understanding the mechanisms driving these sex-differential risk profiles will be useful for treatment development and prevention. © 2015 Werling and Geschwind; licensee BioMed Central.","AGRE; Female protective model; Interbirth interval; Multiplex families; Recurrence risk; Sex differences",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929012029

Sex differences in callosal organization and diffusion characteristics have also not been evaluated fully in ASD. Methods: Structural and diffusion-weighted images were acquired in 139 preschool-aged children with ASD (112 males/27 females) and 82 typically developing (TD) controls (53 males/29 females). Longitudinal scanning at two additional annual time points was carried out in a subset of these participants. Callosal organization was evaluated using two approaches: 1) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to define subregions based on cortical projection zones and 2) as a comparison to previous studies, midsagittal area analysis using Witelson subdivisions. Diffusion measures of callosal fibers were also evaluated. Results: Analyses of cortical projection zone subregions revealed sex differences in the patterns of altered callosal organization. Relative to their sex-specific TD counterparts, both males and females with ASD had smaller regions dedicated to fibers projecting to superior frontal cortex, but patterns differed in callosal subregions projecting to other parts of frontal cortex. While males with ASD had a smaller callosal region dedicated to the orbitofrontal cortex, females with ASD had a smaller callosal region dedicated to the anterior frontal cortex. There were also sex differences in diffusion properties of callosal fibers. While no alterations were observed in males with ASD relative to TD males, mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were all increased in females with ASD relative to TD females. Analyses of Witelson subdivisions revealed a decrease in midsagittal area of the corpus callosum in both males and females with ASD but no regional differences in specific subdivisions. Longitudinal analyses revealed no diagnostic or sex differences in the growth rate or change in diffusion measures of the corpus callosum from 3 to 5 years of age. Conclusions: There are sex differences in the pattern of altered corpus callosum neuroanatomy in preschool-aged children with ASD. © 2015 Nordahl et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Connectivity; Diffusion tensor imaging; Longitudinal; MRI; White matter",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929000881

The typical phenotype includes neonatal hypotonia, moderate to severe intellectual disability, absent or delayed speech, minor dysmorphic features and autism or autistic-like behaviour. Recently, point mutations or micro-deletions of the SHANK3 gene have been identified, accompanied by a phenotype different from the initial clinically description in Phelan McDermid syndrome. Case presentation: Here we present two case studies with similar psychiatric and genetic diagnosis as well as similar clinical history and evolution. The two patients were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in childhood and presented regression with catatonia features and behavioural disorders after a stressful event during adolescence. Interestingly, both patients presented mutation/microdeletion of the SHANK3 gene, inducing a premature stop codon in exon 21. Different pharmacological treatments (antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, mood stabilizer drugs, antidepressants, and methylphenidate) failed to improve clinical symptoms and lead to multiple adverse events. In contrast, lithium therapy reversed clinical regression, stabilized behavioural symptoms and allowed patients to recover their pre-catatonia level of functioning, without significant side effects. Conclusion: These cases support the hypothesis of a specific SHANK3 phenotype. This phenotype might be linked to catatonia-like deterioration for which lithium use could be an efficient treatment. Therefore, these cases provide an important contribution to the field of autism research, clinical genetics and possible pharmacological answers. © 2015 Serret et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Autism; Catatonia; Lithium; Regression; SHANK3 gene",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929012660

High quality visual and audio data allow detailed analysis of children’s bodies and talk as loci of reflexivity. Corporeal reflexivity involves displays of awareness of one’s body as an experiencing subject and a physical object accessible to the gaze of others. Gaze, demeanor, actions, and sotto voce commentaries on unfolding situations indicate a range of moment-by-moment reflexive responses to social situations. Autism is associated with neurologically based motor problems (e.g. delayed action-goal coordination, clumsiness) and highly repetitive movements to self-soothe. These behaviors can provoke derision among classmates at school. Focusing on a 9-year-old girl’s encounters with peers on the playground, this study documents precisely how autistic children can become enmeshed as unwitting objects of stigma and how they reflect upon their social rejection as it transpires. Children with autism spectrum disorders in laboratory settings manifest diminished understandings of social emotions such as embarrassment, as part of a more general impairment in social perspective-taking.

Here, we aimed to advance our hypothesis that glucocorticoids (GCs), recognised key players in neurobiological programming, target development within these systems, with a novel focus on the astrocytic population. Mice received antenatal GC treatment (AGT) by including the synthetic GC, dexamethasone, in the mothers’ drinking water on gestational days 16–19; controls received normal drinking water. Analyses of regional shapes and volumes of the adult SNc and VTA demonstrated that AGT induced long-term, dose-dependent, structural changes that were accompanied by profound effects on astrocytes (doubling/tripling of numbers and/or density). Additionally, AGT induced long-term changes in the population size and distribution of SNc/VTA dopaminergic neurons, confirming and extending our previous observations made in rats. Furthermore, glial/neuronal structural remodelling was sexually dimorphic and depended on the AGT dose and sub-region of the SNc/VTA. Investigations within the neonatal brain revealed that these long-term organisational effects of AGT depend, at least in part, on targeting perinatal processes that determine astrocyte density and programmed cell death in dopaminergic neurons. Collectively, our characterisation of enduring, AGT-induced, sex-specific cytoarchitectural disturbances suggests novel mechanistic links for the strong association between early environmental challenge (inappropriate exposure to excess GCs) and vulnerability to developing aberrant behaviours in later life, with translational implications for dopamine-associated disorders (such as schizophrenia, ADHD, autism, depression), which typically show a sex bias. © 2015 The Author(s)","Antenatal GC treatment; Astrocytes; Dopaminergic neurons; Midbrain; Neurobiological programming; Sex dimorphisms",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928974668

Deficits in emotional engagement are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and may characterize the younger siblings of children with ASD (high-risk siblings). High-risk siblings are likely to exhibit a broad range of positive emotional engagement that may or may not be associated with ASD outcomes. We examined positive emotional engagement (i.e., smiling rate and contingent responsiveness to the partner's smile) during the infant-parent interaction episodes of the face-to-face/still face protocol at 6 months of age. The sample included 43 high-risk infant siblings, 11 of whom went on to an ASD diagnosis, and 25 low-risk siblings with no family history of ASD. Low-risk siblings and high-risk siblings without ASD showed the typical still-face effect (i.e., decreases in smiling rate after period of parental nonresponsiveness), but high-risk siblings with later ASD outcomes did not show this decrease. Although high-risk siblings without an ASD diagnosis were less likely to respond to their parents' smiles than were low-risk siblings, the children with eventual ASD did not differ from the other groups in contingent responsiveness. Findings suggest that subtle differences in positive emotional engagement are present in the early development of high-risk siblings but are not consistently associated with ASD outcomes.

Maternal exposure to OT during birth may have adverse effects on the infant's development, including increased risk for autism. Yet, studies that test this biologically plausible association and whether it is modified by sex are limited and show inconsistent findings. To this end, we conducted an epidemiological analysis, including all singleton live births in Denmark between 2000 and 2009 (N= 557,040), with a follow-up through 2012. A total of 2110 children in this cohort were subsequently diagnosed with autistic disorder according to the ICD-10-DCR. Augmentation of labor with OT was modestly associated with an increased risk for autism in males (HR 1.13; 95% CI, 1.00-1.26; P= 0.04), but not in females (0.99; 0.77-1.27; P= 0.95). Among males exposed to OT augmentation, 560 were subsequently diagnosed with autistic disorder, and among those not exposed, 1177 met criteria for autism (incidence rate 103.2 and 81.4 per 100,000 person-years, respectively). Our findings suggest a modest association between OT-augmented labor and risk for autism in males. However, given the known benefits of using synthetic OT during labor and delivery caution is warranted when interpreting the findings. Future studies should also investigate dose-dependent effect of OT on infant's development. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Augmentation; Autism; Birth cohort; Gender bias; Labor; Pitocin","Report, M.W., Prevalence of autism spectrum disorder among children aged 8 years - autism and developmental disabilities monitoring network, 11 sites, United States, 2010 (2014) Morb Mortal Weekly Rep, 63, pp. 1-21; Constantino, J.N., Charman, T., Gender bias, female resilience, and the sex ratio in autism (2012) J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 7, pp. 675-679; Hallmayer, J., Cleveland, S., Torres, A., Phillips, J., Cohen, B., Torigoe, T., Genetic heritability and shared environmental factors among twin pairs with autism (2011) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 68 (11), pp. 1095-1102; Guinchat, V., Thorsen, P., Laurent, C., Cans, C., Bodeau, N., Cohen, D., Pre-, peri- and neonatal risk factors for autism (2012) Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand, 91, pp. 287-300; Kolevzon, A., Gross, R., Reichenberg, A., Prenatal and perinatal risk factors for autism: a review and integration of findings (2007) Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med, 161, pp. 326-333; Larsson, H.J., Eaton, W.W., Madsen, K.M., Vestergaard, M., Olesen, A.V., Agerbo, E., Risk factors for autism: perinatal factors, parental psychiatric history, and socioeconomic status (2005) Am J Epidemiol, 161, pp. 916-925; Gardener, H., Spiegelman, D., Buka, S.L., Perinatal and neonatal risk factors for autism: a comprehensive meta-analysis (2011) Pediatrics, 128, pp. 344-355; Gregory, S.G., Anthopolos, R., Osgood, C.E., Grotegut, C.A., Miranda, M.L., Association of autism with induced or augmented childbirth in North Carolina Birth Record (1990-1998) and Education Research (1997-2007) databases (2013) JAMA Pediatr, 167, pp. 959-966; Calder, A.A., Loughney, A.D., Weir, C.J., Barber, J.W., Induction of labour in nulliparous and multiparous women: a UK, multicentre, open-label study of intravaginal misoprostol in comparison with dinoprostone (2008) BJOG, 115, pp. 1279-1288; Oscarsson, M.E., Amer-Wåhlin, I., Rydhstroem, H., Källén, K., Outcome in obstetric care related to oxytocin use.

This hypo-responsiveness to stimuli that are engaging to typically developing individuals may result from dysfunctioning motivation, reward, and attention systems in the brain. Here we review an emerging neuroimaging literature that emphasizes a shift from focusing on hypo-activation of isolated brain regions such as the fusiform gyrus, amygdala, and superior temporal sulcus in ASD to a more holistic approach to understanding face perception as a process supported by distributed cortical and subcortical brain networks. We summarize evidence for atypical activation patterns within brain networks that may contribute to social deficits characteristic of the disorder. We conclude by pointing to gaps in the literature and future directions that will continue to shed light on aspects of face processing in autism that are still under-examined. In particular, we highlight the need for more developmental studies and studies examining ecologically valid and naturalistic social stimuli. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Autism; Connectivity; Eye gaze; Faces; FMRI; Social cognition","Amaral, D.G., The promise and the pitfalls of autism research: an introductory note for new autism researchers (2011) Brain Res., 1380, pp. 3-9; Ashwin, C., Baron-Cohen, S., Wheelwright, S., O'Riordan, M.O., Bullmore, E.T., Differential activation of the amygdala and the 'social brain' during fearful face-processing in asperger syndrome (2007) Neuropsychologia, 45 (1), pp. 2-14; Adolphs, R., Cognitive neuroscience of human social behavior (2003) Nat.

In the central nervous system, these molecular imaging techniques can provide critical insights into neurotransmitter receptors and their occupancy by neurotransmitters or drugs. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of studies that have investigated neurotransmitters in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), while earlier studies mostly focused on cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism. The underlying and contributing mechanisms of ASD are largely undetermined and ASD diagnosis relies on the behavioral phenotype. Discovery of biochemical endophenotypes would represent a milestone in autism research that could potentially lead to ASD subtype stratification and the development of novel therapeutic drugs. This review characterizes the prior use of molecular imaging by PET and SPECT in ASD, addresses methodological challenges and highlights areas of future opportunity for contributions from molecular imaging to understand ASD pathophysiology. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Autism spectrum disorder; Molecular imaging; Neuroimaging; Positron emission tomography (PET); Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)","(2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Publishing, Arlington, VA; Barret, O., Tamagnan, G., Batis, J., Jennings, D., Zubal, G., Russell, D., Marek, K., Seibyl, J., Quantitation of glutamate mGluR5 receptor with 18F-FPEB PET in humans (2010) J.

RAD is associated with neglect or maltreatment whereas ASD is not: accurate differential diagnosis is therefore critical. Very little research has investigated the relationship between the two, and it is unknown if standardised measures are able to discriminate between ASD and RAD. The current study aimed to address these issues. Methods: Fifty eight children with ASD, and no history of maltreatment, were group matched on age with 67 children with RAD. Group profiles on multi-informant measures of RAD were investigated and group differences explored. Discriminant function analysis determined assessment features that best discriminated between the two groups. Results: Although, according to parent report, children with ASD presented with significantly fewer indiscriminate friendliness behaviours compared to the RAD group (p<. 0.001), 36 children with ASD appeared to meet core RAD criteria. However, structured observation clearly demonstrated that features were indicative of ASD and not RAD for all but 1 of these 36 children. Conclusions: Children with RAD and children with ASD may demonstrate similar social relationship difficulties but there appears to be a difference in the social quality of the interactions between the groups. In most cases it was possible to differentiate between children with ASD and children with RAD via structured observation. Nevertheless, for a small proportion of children with ASD, particularly those whose difficulties may be more subtle, our current standardised measures, including structured observation, may not be effective in differentiating RAD from ASD. © 2015.","Autism spectrum disorder; Differential diagnosis; Indiscriminate friendliness; Observation; Reactive attachment disorder; Social relationships","Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with reactive attachment disorder in infancy and early childhood (2005) Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 44, pp. 1206-1219; Angold, A., Prendergast, M., Cox, A., Harrington, R., Simonoff, E., Rutter, M., The child and adolescent psychiatric assessment (1995) Psychological Medicine, 25 (4), pp. 739-753; Aronson, M., Hagberg, B., Gillberg, C., Attention deficits and autistic spectrum problems in children exposed to alcohol during gestation: A follow-up study (1997) Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology, 39 (9), pp. 583-587; Atkinson, L., The British picture vocabulary scale (1992) British Journal of Disorders of Communication, 26 (3), pp. 369-372; Baird, G., Simonoff, E., Pickles, A., Chandler, S., Loucas, T., Meldrum, D., Prevalence of disorders of the autism spectrum in a population cohort of children in South Thames: The Special Needs and Autism Project (SNAP) (2006) The Lancet, 368 (9531), pp. 210-215; Becker-Weidman, A., Dyadic developmental psychotherapy: A multi-year follow-up (2006) New Developments in Child Abuse Research, pp. 43-60. , Nova Science Publishers, New York, S.

Nevertheless, most previous studies have focused on examining one index of neuropathology through a single neuroimaging modality, and seldom using multiple modalities to examine the same cohort of individuals. The current study aims to bring together multiple brain imaging modalities (structural MRI, DTI, and 1H-MRS) to investigate the neural architecture in the same set of individuals (19 high-functioning adults with ASD and 18 typically developing (TD) peers). Morphometry analysis revealed increased cortical thickness in ASD participants, relative to typical controls, across the left cingulate, left pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, left inferior temporal cortex, and right precuneus, and reduced cortical thickness in right cuneus and right precentral gyrus. ASD adults also had reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased radial diffusivity (RD) for two clusters on the forceps minor of the corpus callosum, revealed by DTI analyses. 1H-MRS results showed a reduction in the N-acetylaspartate/Creatine ratio in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in ASD participants. A decision tree classification analysis across the three modalities resulted in classification accuracy of 91.9% with FA, RD, and cortical thickness as key predictors. Examining the same cohort of adults with ASD and their TD peers, this study found alterations in cortical thickness, white matter (WM) connectivity, and neurochemical concentration in ASD. These findings underscore the potential for multimodal imaging to better inform on the neural characteristics most relevant to the disorder. © 2015 Korean Biodiversity Information Facility (KBIF) in National Science Museum of Korea and Korea National Arboretum (KNA).","Autism; Classification; DTI; MRI; Multimodal neuroimaging; Spectroscopy","Adolphs, R., The neurobiology of social cognition (2001) Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 11 (2), pp. 231-239; Adolphs, R., The social brain: neural basis of social knowledge (2009) Annual Review of Psychology, 60, pp. 693-716; Akshoomoff, N., Lord, C., Lincoln, A.J., Courchesne, R.Y., Carper, R.A., Townsend, J., Outcome classification of preschool children with autism spectrum disorders using MRI brain measures (2004) Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 43 (3), pp. 349-357; Alexander, A.L., Lee, J.E., Lazar, M., Boudos, R., DuBray, M.B., Oakes, T.R., Diffusion tensor imaging of the corpus callosum in Autism (2007) NeuroImage, 34 (1), pp. 61-73; Amaral, D.G., Schumann, C.M., Nordahl, C.W., Neuroanatomy of autism (2008) Trends in Neurosciences, 31 (3), pp. 137-145; Ameis, S.H., Fan, J., Rockel, C., Voineskos, A.N., Lobaugh, N.J., Soorya, L., Impaired structural connectivity of socio-emotional circuits in autism spectrum disorders: a diffusion tensor imaging study (2011) PLoS One, 6 (11); Anagnostou, E., Taylor, M.J., Review of neuroimaging in autism spectrum disorders: what have we learned and where we go from here (2011) Molecular Autism, 2 (4); Anderson, J.S., Nielsen, J.A., Froehlich, A.L., DuBray, M.B., Druzgal, T.J., Cariello, A.N., Functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging classification of autism (2011) Brain, 134 (12), pp. 3742-3754; Avino, T.A., Hutsler, J.J., Abnormal cell patterning at the cortical gray-white matter boundary in autism spectrum disorders (2010) Brain Research, 1360, pp. 138-146; Barnea-Goraly, N., Kwon, H., Menon, V., Eliez, S., Lotspeich, L., Reiss, A.L., White matter structure in autism: preliminary evidence from diffusion tensor imaging (2004) Biological Psychiatry, 55 (3), pp. 323-326; Barros, R., Basgalupp, M., Carvalho, A., Freitas, A., A survey of evolutionary algorithms for decision-tree induction (2011) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews, 42 (3), pp. 291-312; Basser, P.J., Pierpaoli, C., Microstructural and physiological features of tissues elucidated by quantitative-diffusion-tensor MRI (1996) Journal of Magnetic Resonance, Series B, 111 (3), pp. 209-219; Bates, T.E., Strangward, M., Keelan, J., Davey, G.P., Munro, P.M., Clark, J.B., Inhibition of N-acetylaspartate production: implications for 1H MRS studies invivo (1996) NeuroReport, 7 (8), pp. 1397-1400; Bloemen, O.J., Deeley, Q., Sundram, F., Daly, E.M., Barker, G.J., Jones, D.K., White matter integrity in Asperger syndrome: a preliminary diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging study in adults (2010) Autism Research, 3 (5), pp. 203-213; Brambilla, P., Hardan, A., di Nemi, S.U., Perez, J., Soares, J.C., Brain anatomy and development in autism: review of structural MRI studies (2003) Brain Research Bulletin, 61 (6), pp. 557-569; Casanova, M.F., Buxhoeveden, D.P., Brown, C., Clinical and macroscopic correlates of minicolumnar pathology in autism (2002) Journal of Child Neurology, 17 (9), pp. 692-695; Casanova, M.F., Buxhoeveden, D.P., Switala, A.E., Roy, E., Minicolumnar pathology in autism (2002) Neurology, 58 (3), pp. 428-432; Casanova, M.F., van Kooten, I.A., Switala, A.E., van Engeland, H., Heinsen, H., Steinbusch, H.W., Minicolumnar abnormalities in autism (2006) Acta Neuropathologica, 112 (3), pp. 287-303; Chen, R., Jiao, Y., Herskovits, E.H., Structural MRI in autism spectrum disorder (2011) Pediatric Research, 69, pp. 63R-68R; Chiu, P.H., Kayali, M.A., Kishida, K.T., Tomlin, D., Klinger, L.G., Klinger, M.R., Self responses along cingulate cortex reveal quantitative neural phenotype for high-functioning autism (2008) Neuron, 57 (3), pp. 463-473; Chung, M.K., Robbins, S.M., Dalton, K.M., Davidson, R.J., Alexander, A.L., Evans, A.C., Cortical thickness analysis in autism with heat kernel smoothing (2005) NeuroImage, 25 (4), pp. 1256-1265; Coppersmith, D., Hong, S., Hosking, J., Partitioning nominal attributes in decision trees (1999) Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 3, pp. 197-217; Courchesne, E., Campbell, K., Solso, S., Brain growth across the life span in autism: age-specific changes in anatomical pathology (2011) Brain Research, 1380, pp. 138-145; Coutanche, M.N., Thompson-Schill, S.L., Schultz, R.T., Multi-voxel pattern analysis of fMRI data predicts clinical symptom severity (2011) NeuroImage, 57 (1), pp. 113-123; Dale, A.M., Fischl, B., Sereno, M.I., Cortical surface-based analysis: I.

In many less developed countries, unfortunately, diagnosis of this disorder is delayed. The aim of the present study is to determine whether this disorder can be screened using simple strategies such as comparison of the age of acquisition of motor skills. For this purpose, 124 children with autism were chosen to enter the study, and their parents were asked to retrospectively specify the age of achieving milestones of sitting without support, standing alone and walking alone. Information obtained from the parents was compared with World Health Organization standards. Results indicate that participants (male and female) have significantly delayed age of acquisition of all three skills. Based on this result, it can be suggested that existing standards, as a simple means with low cost and easy availability, can be used for early screening of the disease at a younger age so that treatment can be provided more quickly. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Milestones;

Participants with ASD performed worse than controls on the recognition task but did not show an advantage for inverted face recognition. Both groups directed more visual attention to the eye than the mouth region and gaze patterns were not found to be associated with recognition performance.

In an experimental crossover design, each participant underwent two professional dental cleanings, one in a regular dental environment (RDE) and one in a SADE, administered in a randomized and counterbalanced order 3–4 months apart. Outcomes included measures of physiological anxiety, behavioral distress, pain intensity, and sensory discomfort. Both groups exhibited decreased physiological anxiety and reported lower pain and sensory discomfort in the SADE condition compared to RDE, indicating a beneficial effect of the SADE. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Autism spectrum disorder; Dental anxiety; Electrodermal activity; Occupational therapy; Oral health; Sensory processing; Skin conductance",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928661554

Fewer studies have examined the factors that influence their treatment decisions. In this study, 18 parents of children with ASD rated treatments according to their knowledge about them and how effective they believed them to be. They then distributed tokens representing resources (i.e., money, time, and energy) amongst the treatments they were currently using, or would use were there fewer constraints. Finally, they distributed tokens amongst hypothetical treatments about which they were only given information regarding empirical support and immediacy of outcome. Without the constraints of cost and availability participants distributed resources broadly.

The PA of 60 male students (ASD, n = 30; TD, n = 30) was recorded every 10 s for up to 5 school days by performing uniaxial accelerometry. The main results are listed as follows: (a) daily PA was significantly lower among the students with ASD than among the TD students; (b) students with ASD spent significantly lower proportion of their time in moderate PA than TD students did during physical education (PE), recess, and lunchtime; and (c) fewer students with ASD than TD students achieved the PA guidelines during the school day and PE time.

The effects of the caregiving burden and coping strategies on the depressive symptoms of 60 of these mothers were examined. The adolescents they cared for ranged from 10 to 19 years old (mean age: 14.7 years). Mothers completed self-report written questionnaires. Findings indicated that greater use of problem-focused rather than emotion-focused coping was generally associated with lower levels of caregiver burden and fewer depressive symptoms. Problem-focused coping acted as a buffer when caregiving burdens were high. Specifically, actively confronting, planning, and suppressing competing activities as coping strategies moderated the effect of the caregiving burden on the depressive symptoms of these mothers. This significant buffering effect reflected adaptation to the caregiving burden. Awareness of the effects of coping strategies on maternal well-being could serve as a valuable guide for practitioners. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Animal models offer the opportunity to understand the biological basis of these disorders. Studies comparing different mouse strains have identified the inbred BTBR T + tf/J (BTBR) strain as a mouse model of ASD based on its anti-social and repetitive behaviours. Adult BTBR mice have complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, reduced cortical thickness and changes in early neurogenesis. However, little is known about the development or ultimate organisation of cortical areas devoted to specific sensory and motor functions in these mice that may also contribute to their behavioural phenotype. Results: In this study, we performed diffusion tensor imaging and tractography, together with histological analyses to investigate the emergence of functional areas in the cerebral cortex and their connections in BTBR mice and age-matched C57Bl/6 control mice. We found evidence that neither the anterior commissure nor the hippocampal commissure compensate for the loss of callosal connections, indicating that no interhemispheric neocortical connectivity is present in BTBR mice. We also found that both the primary visual and somatosensory cortical areas are shifted medially in BTBR mice compared to controls and that cortical thickness is differentially altered in BTBR mice between cortical areas and throughout development. Conclusions: We demonstrate that interhemispheric connectivity and cortical area formation are altered in an age- and region-specific manner in BTBR mice, which may contribute to the behavioural deficits previously observed in this strain. Some of these developmental patterns of change are also present in human ASD patients, and elucidating the aetiology driving cortical changes in BTBR mice may therefore help to increase our understanding of this disorder. © Fenlon et al.","Agenesis of the corpus callosum; Autism spectrum disorders (ASD); BTBR mice; Cortical area patterning; Diffusion imaging","Buxbaum, J.D., Hof, P.R., The neuroscience of autism spectrum disorders (2013), p. 2013. , 1st ed.

There is no definite or surrogate neurophysiologic laboratory marker to quantitate the extent of speech and language impairment. The current study was designed to evaluate the abnormalities in Auditory Brainstem Evoked Responses (ABER) in children with speech and language impairment who do not have a hearing deficit or autism. Materials and Methods: ABER recording was done in a cohort of 94 children (age 2-8 y) with DLD without overt hearing deficit or autism. The mean latencies for waves I, II, III, IV and V along with inter peak latencies for I-III, I-V, III-V and amplitude ratio of wave V/I was measured after click stimulus with intensities 110 db until 40 db and compared to age appropriate normograms. Results: The peak latencies for waves I, III & V, inter-peak latencies I-III & I-V, III-V and wave amplitude ratio V/I was found within normal limits in both ears of all the children when compared to age appropriate normograms. Conclusion: The current study therefore emphasizes the fact that ABER may not be used/recommended as diagnostic or prognostic tool in children with speech and language impairment without autism or hearing deficit. The results and the recommendations of this study will definitely reduce the burden on electrophysiologist, laboratories and also save time and financial resources. © 2015, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

Bisphenol A (BPA), a widely used chemical in the plastic containers and in the linings of food and beverage cans, has been suggested to play a possible causative role in some developmental disorders. Here, we report behavioral modifications in Drosophila melanogaster following early exposure to BPA, which may suggest BPA as an environmental risk factor for the behavioral impairments that are the basis of diagnosis of autism and ADHD. In an open field assay with perinatally BPA-exposed and vehicle-treated control Drosophila, different parameters of locomotion (distance traveled, walking speed, spatial movement, mobility, turn angle, angular velocity and meander) were analyzed using the ethovision software. We also examined the repetitive and social interaction behaviors in these flies. In an open field assay, we identified disturbances in the locomotion patterns of BPA-exposed Drosophila that may relate to the decision-making and the motivational state of the animal. An increase in repetitive behavior was observed as an increase in the grooming behavior of Drosophila following BPA exposure. Furthermore, we also observed abnormal social interaction by the BPA-exposed flies in a social setting. These results demonstrate the effect of the environmentally prevalent risk agent BPA on the behavior of Drosophila, and suggest the practicability and the ease of using Drosophila as a model in the studies of neurobehavioral developmental disorders. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Autism; Bisphenol A; Drosophila melanogaster; Grooming; Locomotion; Social interaction","Boyle, C.A., Boulet, S., Schieve, L.A., Cohen, R.A., Blumberg, S.J., Yeargin-Allsopp, M., Trends in the prevalence of developmental disabilities in US children, 1997-2008 (2011) Pediatrics, 127, pp. 1034-1042; Luke, L., Clare, I.C., Ring, H., Redley, M., Watson, P., Decision-making difficulties experienced by adults with autism spectrum conditions (2012) Autism, 16, pp. 612-621; Prevalence of autism spectrum disorder among children aged 8 years - autism and developmental disabilities monitoring network, 11 sites, United States, 2010 (2014) MMWR Surveill Summ, 63, pp. 1-21. , Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network Surveillance year 2010, Principal Investigators, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (CDC); Persico, A.M., Napolioni, V., Autism genetics (2013) Behav Brain Res, 251, pp. 95-112; Huguet, G., Ey, E., Bourgeron, T., The genetic landscapes of autism spectrum disorders (2013) Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet, 14, pp. 191-213; Chauhan, A., Chauhan, V., Oxidative stress in autism (2006) Pathophysiology, 13, pp. 171-181; (2009) Autism: oxidative stress, inflammation and immune abnormalities, , CRC Press: Taylor and Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL, USA, A.

Despite the robustness of the relationship between early-life seizures and the development of autism, the pathophysiological mechanism by which this occurs has not been explored. As a result of increasing evidence that autism is a disorder of brain connectivity we hypothesized that early-life seizures would interrupt normal brain connectivity during brain maturation and result in an autistic phenotype. Normal rat pups underwent recurrent flurothyl-induced seizures from postnatal (P)days 5-14 and then tested, along with controls, for developmental alterations of development brain oscillatory activity from P18-P25. Specifically we wished to understand how normal changes in rhythmicity in and between brain regions change as a function of age and if this rhythmicity is altered or interrupted by early life seizures. In rat pups with early-life seizures, field recordings from dorsal and ventral hippocampus and prefrontal cortex demonstrated marked increase in coherence as well as a decrease in voltage correlation at all bandwidths compared to controls while there were minimal differences in total power and relative power spectral densities. Rats with early-life seizures had resulting impairment in the sociability and social novelty tests but demonstrated no evidence of increased activity or generalized anxiety as measured in the open field. In addition, rats with early-life seizures had lower seizure thresholds than controls, indicating long-standing alterations in the excitatory/inhibition balance. Bumetanide, a pharmacological agent that blocks the activity of NKCC1 and induces a significant shift of ECl toward more hyperpolarized values, administration at the time of the seizures precluded the subsequent abnormalities in coherence and voltage correlation and resulted in normal sociability and seizure threshold. Taken together these findings indicate that early-life seizures alter the development of oscillations and result in autistic-like behaviors. The altered communication between these brain regions could reflect the physiological underpinnings underlying social cognitive deficits seen in autism spectrum disorders. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Coherence; Development; Epilepsy; Power spectrum; Sociability; Voltage correlations","Anney, R., A genome-wide scan for common alleles affecting risk for autism (2010) Hum.

We review evidence for alterations in glutamatergic signalling in the aetiology of ASD, with a focus on the metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 (mGluR5). mGluR5 signalling is important for synapse formation, neuroplasticity and long term potentiation as well as neuroprotection and has been shown to have a regulatory role in neuroinflammation. Evidence for neuroinflammation in ASD is supported by increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and increased number and activation of microglia in postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). mGlur5 signalling has also been shown to downregulate microglial activation. Therefore, we focus on mGluR5 as a potential unifying explanation for synapse alteration and neuroinflammation seen in ASD. Data from mGluR5 knockout mouse models, and syndromic and non syndromic forms of ASD are discussed in relation to how alterations in mGluR5 are associated with ASD symptoms. This review supports altered mGluR5 functioning as a convergent point in ASD pathogenesis and indicates more research is warranted into mGluR5 as a potential therapeutic target. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Autism spectrum disorder; Glutamate; GRM5; MGluR5; Microglia; Neurodevelopment; Neuroinflammation","Abushik, P.A., Niittykoski, M., Giniatullina, R., Shakirzyanova, A., Bart, G., Fayuk, D., Sibarov, D.A., Giniatullin, R., The role of NMDA and mGluR5 receptors in calcium mobilization and neurotoxicity of homocysteine in trigeminal and cortical neurons and glial cells (2014) J.

Dyads with typically developing toddlers and with young children with autism spectrum disorder and Down syndrome (n = 56, 23, and 29) were observed using a Communication Play Protocol during which parents could use novel words to refer to novel objects. Parents readily introduced both labels and sound words even when their child did not respond expressively or produce the words. Results highlight both how parents act in ways that may facilitate their child's appreciation of the relation between a new word and its referent and how they subtly adjust their actions to suit their child's level of word learning and specific learning challenges. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Autism spectrum disorder; Down syndrome; Language development; Parent-child interaction; Vocabulary","Abbeduto, L., Murphy, M.M., Language, social cognition, maladaptive behavior, and communication in Down syndrome and Fragile X syndrome (2004) Developmental language disorders: From phenotypes to etiologies, pp. 77-97. , Erlbaum, Mahwah, NJ, M.L.

Aberrant fronto-striatal glutamatergic signalling is core to the understanding of compulsive and impulsive disorders. In this review, the glutamate (Glu) neurochemistry of fronto-striatal circuits in paediatric and adult ASD, ADHD and OCD, as described in 59 studies, is outlined from the perspective of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS). Despite the methodological inconsistencies between studies, two observations stand out that form possible hypotheses for future studies. Firstly, a possible increase in Glx (combination of Glu, glutamine and GABA) in the striatum across ADHD, OCD and ASD. Secondly, an increased Glx signal in the anterior cingulate cortex in paediatric ASD and ADHD but a lower Glx signal in adult ASD and ADHD. This suggests neurodevelopmental changes in fronto-striatal glutamatergic circuits across the lifespan. Future studies should incorporate more homogeneous samples, perform MRS at field strengths of at least 3Tesla and provide much more precise and standardized information on methods to improve our understanding of fronto-striatal glutamatergic transmission in compulsive and impulsive syndromes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","ADHD; Autism; Compulsivity; GABA; Glutamate; Impulsivity; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; OCD","Alexander, G.E., DeLong, M.R., Strick, P.L., Parallel organization of functionally segregated circuits linking basal ganglia and cortex (1986) Annu.

Recent evidence suggests a possible link between air pollution and neurocognitive impairment and behavioral disorders in children, however, the exact nature of this relationship remains poorly understood. Infants and children are uniquely vulnerable due to the potential for exposure in both the fetal and postnatal environments during critical periods in development. Carbon monoxide (CO), a common component of indoor and outdoor air pollution, can cross the placenta to gain access to the fetal circulation and the developing brain. Thus, CO is of particular interest as a known neurotoxin and a potential public health threat. Here we review overt CO toxicity and the policies regulating CO exposure, detail the evidence suggesting a potential link between CO-associated ambient air pollution, tobacco smoke, and learning and behavioral abnormalities in children, describe the effects of subclinical CO exposure on the brain during development, and provide mechanistic insight into a potential connection between CO exposure and neurodevelopmental outcome. CO can disrupt a number of critical processes in the developing brain, providing a better understanding of how this specific neurotoxin may impair neurodevelopment. However, further investigation is needed to better define the effects of perinatal CO exposure on the immature brain. Current policies regarding CO standards were established based on evidence of cardiovascular risk in adults with pre-existing comorbidities. Thus, recent and emerging data highlighted in this review regarding CO exposure in the fetus and developing child may be important to consider when the standards and guidelines are evaluated and revised in the future. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Autism; Brain; Carbon monoxide; Development; Toxicity","Adams, K.F., Koch, G., Chatterjee, B., Goldstein, G.M., O'Neil, J.J., Bromberg, P.A., Acute elevation of blood carboxyhemoglobin to 6% impairs exercise performance and aggravates symptoms in patients with ischemic heart disease (1988) J Am Coll Cardiol, 12, pp. 900-909; Alehan, F., Erol, I., Onay, O.S., Cerebral palsy due to nonlethal maternal carbon monoxide intoxication (2007) Birth Defects Res A Clin Mol Teratol, 79, pp. 614-616; Allen, J.L., Liu, X., Weston, D., Prince, L., Oberdörster, G., Finkelstein, J.N., Developmental exposure to concentrated ambient ultrafine particulate matter air pollution in mice results in persistent and sex-dependent behavioral neurotoxicity and glial activation (2014) Toxicol Sci, 140, pp. 160-178; Allred, E.N., Bleecker, E.R., Chaitman, B.R., Dahms, T.E., Gottlieb, S.O., Hackney, J.D., Short-term effects of carbon monoxide exposure on the exercise performance of subjects with coronary artery disease (1989) N Engl J Med, 321, pp. 1426-1432; Allred, E.N., Bleecker, E.R., Chaitman, B.R., Dahms, T.E., Gottlieb, S.O., Hackney, J.D., Effects of carbon monoxide on myocardial ischemia (1991) Environ Health Perspect, 91, pp. 89-132; Anderson, E.W., Andelman, R.J., Strauch, J.M., Fortuin, N.J., Knelson, J.H., Effect of low-level carbon monoxide exposure on onset and duration of angina pectoris.

Autistic traits of mothers, fathers and children were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). GNC in children was measured using questions from the Recalled Childhood Gender Identity/Gender Role Questionnaire. In multivariable analyses increase in child’s SRS score was associated with increased odds (OR 1.35; p = 0.03) of being in a higher GNC category. Increase in maternal SRS score was also associated with increased odds (OR 1.46; p = 0.005) of the child being in a higher GNC category.

They show variable clinical expressivity, being associated with different disorders, and incomplete penetrance. However, due to its very low frequency, the full variety of clinical outcomes associated with each one of these CNVs is unknown. Current methods for detection of CNVs are labor intensive, expensive or not suitable for high throughput analysis. Quantitative interspecies competitive PCR linked to variant minisequencing and detection by mass-spectrometry may overcome these limitations. Here, we present two multiplex assays based on this method to screen for eleven psychiatric risk CNVs, such as 1q21, 16p11.2, 3q29, or 16p13.11 regions, among others. The assays were tested in our collection of 514 schizophrenia patients. Results were compared with MLPA at two CNVs. Additional positive results were confirmed by exome sequencing. A total of fourteen patients were CNV carriers. The method presents high sensitivity and specificity, showing its utility as a cheap, accurate, high throughput screening tool for recurrent CNVs. The method may be very useful for management of psychiatric patients as well as screening of different collections of samples to better identify the full spectrum of clinical variability. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Autism; Copy number variants; Psychiatric genetics; Quantitative interspecies competitive PCR; Schizophrenia","Stefansson, H., Rujescu, D., Cichon, S., Large recurrent microdeletions associated with schizophrenia (2008) Nature, 455, pp. 232-236; Levinson, D.F., Duan, J., Oh, S., Copy number variants in schizophrenia: confirmation of five previous findings and new evidence for 3q29 microdeletions and VIPR2 duplications (2011) Am J Psychiatry, 168, pp. 302-316; Malhotra, D., Sebat, J., CNVs: harbingers of a rare variant revolution in psychiatric genetics (2012) Cell, 148, pp. 1223-1241; Kirov, G., Rees, E., Walters, J.T.R., The penetrance of copy number variations for schizophrenia and developmental delay (2013) Biol Psychiatry, 75, pp. 378-385; Rees, E., Moskvina, V., Owen, M.J., O'Donovan, M.C., Kirov, G., De novo rates and selection of schizophrenia-associated copy number variants (2011) Biol Psychiatry, 70, pp. 1109-1114; Rees, E., Walters, J.T.R., Georgieva, L., Analysis of copy number variations at 15 schizophrenia-associated loci (2014) Br J Psychiatry, 204, pp. 108-114; Girirajan, S., Campbell, C.D., Eichler, E.E., Human copy number variation and complex genetic disease (2011) Annu Rev Genet, 45, pp. 203-226; Costain, G., Lionel, A.C., Merico, D., Pathogenic rare copy number variants in community-based schizophrenia suggest a potential role for clinical microarrays (2013) Hum Mol Genet, 22, pp. 4485-4501; Aradhya, S., Cherry, A.M., Counting chromosomes to exons: advances in copy number detection (2013) Curr Genet Med Rep, 1, pp. 71-80; Williams, N.M., Williams, H., Majounie, E., Analysis of copy number variation using quantitative interspecies competitive PCR (2008) Nucleic Acids Res, 36, p. e112; Carrera, N., Arrojo, M., Sanjuán, J., Association study of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in schizophrenia (2012) Biol Psychiatry, 71, pp. 169-177; Vacic, V., McCarthy, S., Malhotra, D., Duplications of the neuropeptide receptor gene VIPR2 confer significant risk for schizophrenia (2011) Nature, 471, pp. 499-503; McKenna, A., Hanna, M., Banks, E., The genome analysis toolkit: a MapReduce framework for analyzing next-generation DNA sequencing data (2010) Genome Res, 20, pp. 1297-1303; Plagnol, V., Curtis, J., Epstein, M., A robust model for read count data in exome sequencing experiments and implications for copy number variant calling (2012) Bioinformatics, 28, pp. 2747-2754; Rees, E., Kirov, G., Sanders, A., Evidence that duplications of 22q11.2 protect against schizophrenia (2014) Mol Psychiatry, 19, pp. 37-40; Conrad, D.F., Pinto, D., Redon, R., Origins and functional impact of copy number variation in the human genome (2010) Nature, 464, pp. 704-712; Guha, S., Rees, E., Darvasi, A., Implication of a rare deletion at distal 16p11.2 in schizophrenia (2013) JAMA, Psychiatry, 70, pp. 253-260; Miller, D.T., Adam, M.P., Aradhya, S., Consensus statement: chromosomal microarray is a first-tier clinical diagnostic test for individuals with developmental disabilities or congenital anomalies (2010) Am J Hum Genet, 86, pp. 749-764; Van Den Bossche, M.J., Johnstone, M., Strazisar, M., Rare copy number variants in neuropsychiatric disorders: specific phenotype or not?

The explanation of this high comorbidity has remained a scientific puzzle. We propose 'disrupted emotion processing' as a liability spectrum that underlies many different mental disorders. Emotion processing deficits have been reported in different disorders and result in difficulties in regulating emotions and at the perceptual level in attentional biases and impaired recognition of emotional expressions. This article provides a detailed overview of the literature on disrupted emotion processing in clinical groups on the behavioral and neurological level. In the discussion, the similarities and differences between these disorders are discussed in the context of common neuro-endocrine, genetic and environmental factors and ideas are put forward on how future research may advance. Most importantly, more interdisciplinary research is needed in which different techniques, tasks and clinical populations are combined to get a better understanding of disrupted emotion processing as a liability spectrum underlying various different mental disorders. © 2015.","Emotion perception; Emotion recognition; Emotion regulation; FMRI; Mental disorders","Adolphs, R., What does the amygdala contribute to social cognition?

Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, University of Southern California, 1540 East Alcazar Street, CHP 133Los Angeles, CA, United States","‘Being autistic’ or ‘having Autism Spectrum Disorder’ implies a limited range of ‘being social,’ but the in situ organization of interaction, what Maynard and Marlaire (Qual Soc 15(2):177–202, 1992) call the ‘interactional substrate,’ within which this delimitation enfolds is usually hidden from sight. Analysis of processes constituting different ‘interactional substrates’ provides a view of how one comes to be known by and to self and others as a certain kind of being who is available (or not) for acting and feeling in certain ways. People diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 2013) are often described as ‘being’ impaired in intersubjective understanding of others. But the story of ASD as an impairment of sociality and intersubjectivity becomes more complicated when animals enter into the picture. I consider two interactional substrates: a psychological interview in a mental health clinic, and an animal-assisted activity in a child’s neighborhood. I aim to elucidate the practical problems of ‘being social’ encountered by two children with ASD, both nine-year-old girls, within these two very differently organized interactional substrates. I consider ways in which ‘being with’ therapy animals provides a way of ‘being social’ through “sensory modalities of knowing” (Haraway, When species meet, 2008:371). © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Animal-assisted activity; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Human–animal interaction; Intersubjectivity; Psychological testing; Sociality; Therapy animals",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928667239

We used data from a population-based developmental disabilities surveillance program for 8-year-olds in metropolitan Atlanta. From 1991-2010, prevalence estimates of ID and HL were stable with slight increases in VI prevalence. CP prevalence was constant from 1993-2010. The average annual increase in ASD prevalence was 9.3% per year from 1996-2010, with a 269% increase from 4.2 per 1,000 in 1996 to 15.5 per 1,000 in 2010. From 2000-2010, the prevalence of ID without ASD was stable; during the same time, the prevalence of ASD with and without co-occurring ID increased by an average of 6.6% and 9.6% per year, respectively. ASD prevalence increases were found among both males and females, and among nearly all racial/ethnic subgroups and levels of intellectual ability. Average annual prevalence estimates from 1991-2010 underscore the significant community resources needed to provide early intervention and ongoing supports for children with ID (13.0 per 1,000), CP, (3.5 per 1,000), HL (1.4 per 1,000) and VI (1.3 in 1,000), with a growing urgency for children with ASD. © 2015, Public Library of Science.

We aimed to examine the behavioral side effect profile using longitudinal and quantitative data and review the potential mechanisms behind behavioral changes. Methods: We present a case report of a 10-year-old boy with autistic spectrum disorder and epilepsy, who underwent vagus nerve stimulation subsequent to unsuccessful treatment with antiepileptic medication. Results: Following vagus nerve stimulation implantation, initial, if temporary, improvement was observed in seizure control. Modest improvements were also observed in behavior and development, improvements which were observed independent of seizure control. Conclusions: Vagus nerve stimulation in autistic spectrum disorder is associated with modest behavioral improvement, with unidentified etiology, although several candidates for this improvement are evident. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Autism; Epilepsy; Stereotypy; Vagus nerve stimulation",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928609136

DYRK1A has a critical role in brain growth and development primarily by regulating cell proliferation, neurogenesis, neuronal plasticity and survival. Several patients have been reported with chromosome 21 aberrations such as partial monosomy, involving multiple genes including DYRK1A. In addition, seven other individuals have been described with chromosomal rearrangements, intragenic deletions or truncating mutations that disrupt specifically DYRK1A. Most of these patients have microcephaly and all have significant intellectual disability. In the present study, we report 10 unrelated individuals with DYRK1A-associated intellectual disability (ID) who display a recurrent pattern of clinical manifestations including primary or acquired microcephaly, ID ranging from mild to severe, speech delay or absence, seizures, autism, motor delay, deep-set eyes, poor feeding and poor weight gain. We identified unique truncating and non-synonymous mutations (three nonsense, four frameshift and two missense) in DYRK1A in nine patients and a large chromosomal deletion that encompassed DYRK1A in one patient. On the basis of increasing identification of mutations in DYRK1A, we suggest that this gene be considered potentially causative in patients presenting with ID, primary or acquired microcephaly, feeding problems and absent or delayed speech with or without seizures.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 29 April 2015; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2015.29. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928680063

Incidence of autism is higher than earlier estimates, and treatments have limited efficacy and are costly. Limited clinical and experimental evidence suggest that patients with autism may benefit from electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). We examined the therapeutic potential of ECT in BTBR T+ tf/j mice, which represent a validated model of autism. A series of 13 electroconvulsive shocks (ECS) delivered twice a day over 7 days reversed core autism-like behavioral abnormalities—impaired sociability, social novelty, and repetitive behavior—when the animals were tested 24 h after the last ECS. The effect lasted up to 2 weeks after ECT. Neither single ECS nor a series of 6 ECS modified animals’ behavior. Chronic infusion into the lateral brain ventricle of a preferential oxytocin receptor blocker (2S)-2-Amino-N-[(1S,2S,4R)-7,7-dimethyl-1-[[[4-(2-methylphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]sulfonyl]methyl]bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl]-4-(methylsulfonyl)butanamide hydrochloride abolished ECT-induced improvement of sociability and mitigated improvement of social novelty but did not affect ECT-induced reversal of repetitive behavior. These proof-of-principle experiments suggest that ECT may, indeed, be useful in the treatment of autism, and that its therapeutic effects may be mediated, in part, by central oxytocin signaling. © 2015 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.","Autism; BTBR mice; Electroconvulsive therapy; Oxytocin; Oxytocin receptor blocker",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928603548

The phenotypic spectrum of PTEN mutations expanded to include autism with macrocephaly only 10 years ago. Neurological studies of patients with PTEN-associated autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show increases in cortical white matter and a distinctive cognitive profile, including delayed language development with poor working memory and processing speed. Once a germline PTEN mutation is found, and a diagnosis of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) hamartoma tumor syndrome made, the clinical outlook broadens to include higher lifetime risks for multiple cancers, beginning in childhood with thyroid cancer. First described as a tumor suppressor, PTEN is a major negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway—controlling growth, protein synthesis, and proliferation. This canonical function combines with less well-understood mechanisms to influence synaptic plasticity and neuronal cytoarchitecture. Several excellent mouse models of Pten loss or dysfunction link these neural functions to autism-like behavioral abnormalities, such as altered sociability, repetitive behaviors, and phenotypes like anxiety that are often associated with ASD in humans. These models also show the promise of mTOR inhibitors as therapeutic agents capable of reversing phenotypes ranging from overgrowth to low social behavior. Based on these findings, therapeutic options for patients with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome and ASD are coming into view, even as new discoveries in PTEN biology add complexity to our understanding of this master regulator. © 2015 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928635922

The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of GR isoforms (GRα, GRβ, GRγ, and GRP), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), GR co-chaperones (FKBP5, PTGES3, and BAG1), and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-γ) were examined in the postmortem middle frontal gyrus tissues of 13 ASD and 13 age-matched controls by qRT-PCR. The protein levels were examined by Western blotting. We found significant decreases in GRα (64 %), GRγ (48 %), GRP (20 %) and MR (46 %) mRNA levels in ASD subjects as compared to controls. However, significant increases in FKBP5 (42 %) and PTGES3 (35 %) mRNA levels were observed in ASD subjects. There were no differences in the mRNA levels of GRβ and BAG1 in ASD subjects as compared to controls. MR mRNA was found to be negatively correlated with the diagnostic score for abnormality of development. On the protein level, significant reductions in GR and MR, but no change in FKBP5 and PTGES3 were found in ASD subjects as compared to controls. Moreover, we observed significant increases in IL-1β and IFN-γ mRNA levels in ASD subjects, and these cytokines were negatively associated with GR levels.

Studies focusing on the visual memory performance in ASD have shown controversial results. We investigated visual memory and sustained attention in youths with ASD and typically developing (TD) youths. Method: We recruited 143 pairs of youths with ASD (males 93.7%; mean age 13.1, s.d. 3.5 years) and age- and sex-matched TD youths. The ASD group consisted of 67 youths with autistic disorder (autism) and 76 with Asperger's disorder (AS) based on the DSM-IV criteria. They were assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery involving the visual memory [spatial recognition memory (SRM), delayed matching to sample (DMS), paired associates learning (PAL)] and sustained attention (rapid visual information processing; RVP). Results: Youths with ASD performed significantly worse than TD youths on most of the tasks; the significance disappeared in the superior intelligence quotient (IQ) subgroup. The response latency on the tasks did not differ between the ASD and TD groups. Age had significant main effects on SRM, DMS, RVP and part of PAL tasks and had an interaction with diagnosis in DMS and RVP performance. There was no significant difference between autism and AS on visual tasks. Conclusions: Our findings implied that youths with ASD had a wide range of visual memory and sustained attention impairment that was moderated by age and IQ, which supports temporal and frontal lobe dysfunction in ASD. The lack of difference between autism and AS implies that visual memory and sustained attention cannot distinguish these two ASD subtypes, which supports DSM-5 ASD criteria.

However, emotion recognition (ER) studies have focused mostly on recognition of the six 'basic' emotions, usually using still pictures of faces. Methods: This study describes a new battery of tasks for testing recognition of nine complex emotions and mental states from video clips of faces and from voice recordings taken from the Mindreading DVD. This battery (the Cambridge Mindreading Face-Voice Battery for Children or CAM-C) was given to 30 high-functioning children with ASC, aged 8 to 11, and to 25 matched controls. Results: The ASC group scored significantly lower than controls on complex ER from faces and voices. In particular, participants with ASC had difficulty with six out of nine complex emotions. Age was positively correlated with all task scores, and verbal IQ was correlated with scores in the voice task. CAM-C scores were negatively correlated with parent-reported level of autism spectrum symptoms. Conclusions: Children with ASC show deficits in recognition of complex emotions and mental states from both facial and vocal expressions. The CAM-C may be a useful test for endophenotypic studies of ASC and is one of the first to use dynamic stimuli as an assay to reveal the ER profile in ASC. It complements the adult version of the CAM Face-Voice Battery, thus providing opportunities for developmental assessment of social cognition in autism. © 2015 Golan et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Autism spectrum conditions; Complex emotions; Emotion recognition; Empathy; Facial expressions; Prosody; Theory of mind",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928555690

However, there are very few studies thus far addressing risk factors for ASD in Thai children. This case-control study aims to investigate whether various risk factors especially socioeconomic status, advanced parental age (age >35 years), perinatal factors, maternal autoimmune diseases, and family history of neuropsychiatric illnesses were associated with the risk of having an offspring with ASD. There were 235 children with ASD (age 8.44 ± 3.37 years) and 235 controls (age 8.39 ± 3.37 years) enrolled in this study. The risk of developing ASD in these children included advanced paternal age (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.49, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 2.05–5.96), family history of neuropsychiatric illnesses particularly if such disorders came from the paternal side of the child’s family (AOR = 2.87, 95 % CI = 1.29–6.39), and having unemployed mothers (AOR = 1.65, 95 % CI = 1.08–2.54). Conclusion: This study supports previous findings of Western countries where risk factors for ASD tend to occur in children whose fathers were of advanced paternal age and in the families with neuropsychiatric illnesses particularly if such disorders came from the paternal side of the child’s family.(Table presented.) © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Autism; Children; Neuropsychiatric disorders; Paternal age; Risk",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928340517

This chronic stress has been reported to have deleterious effects on caregivers' cognition, particularly in verbal declarative memory. Moreover, such cognitive decline may be mediated by testosterone (T) levels and negative affect, understood as depressive mood together with high anxiety and anger. This study aimed to compare declarative memory function in middle-aged women who were caregivers for individuals with ASD (n = 24; mean age = 45) and female controls (n = 22; mean age = 45), using a standardised memory test (Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test). It also sought to examine the role of care recipient characteristics, negative mood and T levels in memory impairments. ASD caregivers were highly sensitive to proactive interference and verbal forgetting. In addition, they had higher negative affect and T levels, both of which have been associated with poorer verbal memory performance. Moreover, the number of years of caregiving affected memory performance and negative affect, especially, in terms of anger feelings. On the other hand, T levels in caregivers had a curvilinear relationship with verbal memory performance; that is, increases in T were associated with improvements in verbal memory performance up to a certain point, but subsequently, memory performance decreased with increasing T. Chronic stress may produce disturbances in mood and hormonal levels, which in turn might increase the likelihood of developing declarative memory impairments although caregivers do not show a generalised decline in memory. These findings should be taken into account for understanding the impact of cognitive impairments on the ability to provide optimal caregiving. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","Autism spectrum disorders; Caregiver; Declarative memory; Testosterone; Women",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928592217

In order to model behavioral disorders in animals, it is important to assess baseline sex-related behavioral differences, especially when studying disorders for which sex-related behavioral effects are expected. We investigated the effect of sex on behavior in three strains of prepubertal mice (C57BL/6, CFW, and CF1) using a wheel-running assay. We found no significant sex differences in latency to run on the wheel or total duration of wheel running within each strain. During the social interaction test, there were no differences between the sexes in latency or total duration of contact or following between a subject and a novel mouse. We also evaluated behavioral patterns of wheel running and stereotypical behaviors such as burrowing and grooming. Both sexes showed characteristic wheel-running behavior, spending the majority of each trial interacting with the wheel when it was free and more time performing other activities (e.g., stereotypical behaviors, general locomotion) when it was jammed. These results provide evidence that, among various strains of prepubertal mice, baseline sex-related behavioral differences are not strong enough to influence the measured behaviors. © 2015 Japan Ethological Society and Springer Japan","Autism behavioral assay; Juvenile mice; Sexually dimorphic behavior; Wheel running",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928309057

Although its function has not been well-characterized, ZNF804A contains a C2H2-type zinc-finger domain, suggesting that it has DNA binding properties, and consequently, a role in regulating gene expression. To further explore the role of ZNF804A on gene expression and its downstream targets, we used a gene knockdown (KD) approach to reduce its expression in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). KD was accomplished by RNA interference (RNAi) using lentiviral particles containing shRNAs that target ZNF804A mRNA. Stable transduced NPC lines were generated after puromycin selection. A control cell line expressing a random (scrambled) shRNA was also generated. Neuronal differentiation was induced, RNA was harvested after 14 days and transcriptome analysis was carried out using RNA-seq. 1815 genes were found to be differentially expressed at a nominally significant level (p<0.05); 809 decreased in expression in the KD samples, while 1106 increased. Of these, 370 achieved genome wide significance (FDR<0.05); 125 were lower in the KD samples, 245 were higher. Pathway analysis showed that genes involved in interferon-signaling were enriched among those that were down-regulated in the KD samples. Correspondingly, ZNF804A KD was found to affect in-terferon- alpha 2 (IFNA2)-mediated gene expression. The findings suggest that ZNF804A may affect a differentiating neuron's response to inflammatory cytokines, which is consistent with models of SZ and ASD that support a role for infectious disease, and/or autoimmunity in a subgroup of patients. © 2015 Chen et al.",,"Riley, B., Thiselton, D., Maher, B.S., Bigdeli, T., Wormley, B., Replication of association between schizophrenia and ZNF804A in the irish case-control study of schizophrenia sample (2010) Mol Psychiatry, 15, pp. 29-37. , PMID: 19844207;

While current UK legislation emphasises the choice that parents of children with special educational needs should have in educational decision-making, there is a dearth of research in this area, which means that little is known about how parents come to make decisions about secondary school placements and the types of support, if any, they receive from professionals. The present study aimed to determine the factors that immediately influence secondary school choice for young people with autism in one London local authority from the perspectives of multiple informants. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents of children with autism (n = 7), young people themselves prior to secondary school entry (n = 6), parent advisors (n = 5) and secondary school professionals (n = 5). Parents emphasised the anxiety and burden of the decision-making process. There was, however, substantial agreement among adult groups on the factors necessary for a successful secondary school placement: a nurturing, flexible and inclusive environment that emphasised both academic and life skills. Few adults, however, mentioned the importance of children's social relationships – a factor that featured prominently in the reports of young people. These findings highlight both the different perceptions of those involved in making decisions about the educational placements of children with autism and the challenges associated with weighing up these potentially conflicting perspectives. More work is needed to ensure both that information is transparent and accessible to all parents and that young people are actively involved in decisions that ultimately affect their lives. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","autism; decision-making; education; parents; school; special educational needs",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928243803

Collybistin (CB), a neuron-specific Rho-GEF responsible for X-linked intellectual disability with epilepsy, also interacts with eIF3, and its binding partner gephyrin associates with mTOR. Therefore, we hypothesized that CB also binds mTOR and affects mTORC1 signaling activity in neuronal cells. Here, by using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells from a male patient with a deletion of entire CB gene and from control individuals, as well as a heterologous expression system, we describe that CB physically interacts with mTOR and inhibits mTORC1 signaling pathway and protein synthesis. These findings suggest that disinhibited mTORC1 signaling may also contribute to the pathological process in patients with loss-of-function variants in CB.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 22 April 2015; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2015.69. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928326625

The sample consisted of 399 children with a mean age of 3.38 years (SD = 1.14) divided into a group of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and a group of children not on the autism spectrum, with and without developmental delays. The study used the MSEL and several other measures assessing constructs relevant to the age range-including developmental skills, autism symptoms, and psychopathology symptoms-across multiple methods of assessment. Multiple-group confirmatory factor analyses revealed good overall fit and equal form of the MSEL 1-factor model across the ASD and nonspectrum groups, supporting the construct validity of the MSEL. However, neither full nor partial invariance of factor loadings was established because of the lower loadings in the ASD group compared with the nonspectrum group. Exploratory structural equation modeling revealed that other measures of developmental skills loaded together with the MSEL domain scores on a Developmental Functioning factor, supporting convergent validity of the MSEL. Divergent validity was supported by the lack of loading of MSEL domain scores on Autism Symptoms or Emotion/Behavior Problems factors. Although factor structure and loadings varied across groups, convergent and divergent validity findings were similar in the ASD and nonspectrum samples. Together, these results demonstrate evidence for the construct, convergent, and divergent validity of the MSEL using powerful data-analytic techniques.

Genetic factors also underlie the differential vulnerability to environmental risk factors of susceptible individuals. Currently the way in whichenvironmental risk factors interact with genetic factors to increase the incidence of ASD isnot well understood. A greater understanding of the metabolic, cellular, and biochemical events involved in gene x environment interactions in ASD would have important implications for the prevention and possible treatment of the disorder. In this review we discuss variousestablished and more alternative processes through which environmental factors implicated in ASD can modulate the genome and epigenome of genetically-susceptible individuals. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Endocrine; Endocrine disruptors; Epigenome; Gene environment interactions; Genotype; Gut microbes; Immune; Oxidative stress; Seizures; Transgenerational; Transposable elements; Xenobiotic","Geschwind, D.H., Advances in autism (2009) Annu.

Method: Children with ASD and comorbid anxiety disorders (n = 79, 58 boys; Mage = 11.76) and children with anxiety disorders (n = 95, 46 boys; Mage = 12.85), and their parents, participated. All families were referred to 1 of 7 mental health care centers and received the same CBT. Anxiety, quality of life, ASD-like behaviors, and emotional-behavioral problems were measured at waitlist (ASD-group only, n = 17), pretest, posttest, and 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years after CBT. Results: CBT was more effective than waitlist for treating anxiety disorders (d = ?1.45) and anxiety symptoms (d = ?0.48) in children with ASD. At 2 years follow-up, 61% of the children with and 64% without ASD were free of their primary anxiety disorder (percentages not significantly different). The decrease in severity of anxiety disorders after CBT (d values ranging between ?1.05 and ?1.46) was not different for children with and without ASD. Improvements were less in children with ASD for (only) 2 out of 7 continuous outcomes measures: anxiety symptoms (d values ranging between ?0.68 and ?0.94 vs. d values ranging between ?0.98 and ?1.25) and quality of life (d values ranging between 0.39 and 0.56 vs. d values ranging between 0.77 and 0.98). Conclusions: CBT for anxiety disorders is effective for children with ASD, also in the long-term. Treatment gains may be somewhat less compared with children without ASD.

Neuroinflammation and synaptic alterations in several brain areas have been suggested to contribute to the physiopathology of ASD. Although the limbic system plays an important role in the functions found impaired in ASD, reports on these areas are scarce and results controversial. In the present study we searched in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus of rats exposed to the valproic acid (VPA) model of ASD for early structural and molecular changes, coincident in time with the behavioral alterations. After confirming delayed growth and maturation in VPA rats, we were able to detect decreased exploratory activity and social interaction at an early time point (postnatal day 35). In mPFC, although typical cortical column organization was preserved in VPA animals, we found that interneuronal space was wider than in controls. Hippocampal CA3 (cornu ammonis 3) pyramidal layer and the granular layer of the dentate gyrus both showed a disorganized spatial arrangement in VPA animals. Neuronal alterations were accompanied with increased tomato lectin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostainings both in the mPFC and hippocampus. In the latter region, the increased GFAP immunoreactivity was CA3 specific. At the synaptic level, while mPFC from VPA animals showed increased synaptophysin (SYN) immunostaining, a SYN deficit was found in all hippocampal subfields. Additionally, both the mPFC and the hippocampus of VPA rats showed increased neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) immunostaining together with decreased levels of its polysialylated form (PSA-NCAM). Interestingly, these changes were more robust in the CA3 hippocampal subfield. Our results indicate that exploratory and social deficits correlate with region-dependent neuronal disorganization and reactive gliosis in the mPFC and hippocampus of VPA rats. While microgliosis is spread in these two limbic areas, astrogliosis, although extended in the mPFC, is circumscribed to the CA3 hippocampal subfield. Our work indicates that neuroinflammation and synaptic alterations do coexist in VPA rats, making this model suitable for studying novel aspects of neuron-glia interactions. Moreover, it suggests that the mPFC and hippocampus might behave differently in the context of the local hyperconnectivity and synaptic hypotheses of autism. © 2015 S.

However, usually philosophical papers on the ethics of human–robot-interaction do not take into account stakeholders’ views; yet it is important to involve stakeholders in order to render the research responsive to concerns within the autism and autism therapy community. To support responsible research and innovation in this field, this paper identifies a range of ethical, social and therapeutic concerns, and presents and discusses the results of an exploratory survey that investigated these issues and explored stakeholders’ expectations about this kind of therapy. We conclude that although in general stakeholders approve of using robots in therapy for children with ASD, it is wise to avoid replacing therapists by robots and to develop and use robots that have what we call supervised autonomy. This is likely to create more trust among stakeholders and improve the quality of the therapy. Moreover, our research suggests that issues concerning the appearance of the robot need to be adequately dealt with by the researchers and therapists. For instance, our survey suggests that zoomorphic robots may be less problematic than robots that look too much like humans. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Appearance; ASD; Autism; Ethics of robotics; Robot assisted therapy; Safety; Therapy; Trust",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928136194

Although the overall prevalence of PMS is unknown, there have been at least 1200 cases reported worldwide, according to the Phelan–McDermid Syndrome Foundation. PMS is now considered to be a relatively common cause of ASD and intellectual disability, accounting for between 0.5 % and 2.0 % of cases. The cause of PMS has been isolated to loss of function of one copy of SHANK3, which codes for a master scaffolding protein found in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. Reduced expression of SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 (SHANK3) leads to reduced numbers of dendrites, and impaired synaptic transmission and plasticity. Recent mouse and human neuronal models of PMS have led to important opportunities to develop novel therapeutics, and at least 2 clinical trials are underway, one in the USA, and one in the Netherlands. The SHANK3 pathway may also be relevant to other forms of ASD, and many of the single-gene causes of ASD identified to date appear to converge on several common molecular pathways that underlie synaptic neurotransmission. As a result, treatments developed for PMS may also affect other forms of ASD. © 2015 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.","22q13 deletion syndrome; Autism; Autism spectrum disorder; Neurodevelopmental disorders; Phelan-McDermid syndrome; SHANK3",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928154892

Results Results indicated that all three children with ASD demonstrated increased engagement with the games and social engagement with their peers. Inappropriate behaviour decreased with the intervention. The effects were maintained during the follow-up and generalised to a novel game. Social validity data indicated that the study was meaningful and the intervention was feasible and effective.

Recent findings support a highly heterogeneous and complex genetic etiology including rare de novo and inherited mutations or chromosomal rearrangements as well as double or multiple hits. Methods: We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and blood cell transcriptome by RNAseq in a subset of male patients with idiopathic ASD (n = 36) in order to identify causative genes, transcriptomic alterations, and susceptibility variants. Results: We detected likely monogenic causes in seven cases: five de novo (SCN2A, MED13L, KCNV1, CUL3, and PTEN) and two inherited X-linked variants (MAOA and CDKL5). Transcriptomic analyses allowed the identification of intronic causative mutations missed by the usual filtering of WES and revealed functional consequences of some rare mutations. These included aberrant transcripts (PTEN, POLR3C), deregulated expression in 1.7% of mutated genes (that is, SEMA6B, MECP2, ANK3, CREBBP), allele-specific expression (FUS, MTOR, TAF1C), and non-sense-mediated decay (RIT1, ALG9). The analysis of rare inherited variants showed enrichment in relevant pathways such as the PI3K-Akt signaling and the axon guidance. Conclusions: Integrative analysis of WES and blood RNAseq data has proven to be an efficient strategy to identify likely monogenic forms of ASD (19% in our cohort), as well as additional rare inherited mutations that can contribute to ASD risk in a multifactorial manner. Blood transcriptomic data, besides validating 88% of expressed variants, allowed the identification of missed intronic mutations and revealed functional correlations of genetic variants, including changes in splicing, expression levels, and allelic expression. © 2015 Codina-Solà et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","ASD; CNV; SNV; Whole-exome sequencing",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928978937

Antenatal depression is not harmless for the developing child as several changes, including neurodevelopmental alterations, have been reported. Sometimes it is unavoidable to treat a pregnant mother with antidepressants, especially when she is suicidal. Currently, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the pharmacological choice of antidepressant treatment. SSRIs do not cause gross teratogenic alterations and are generally considered safe for use in pregnancy. However, although SSRIs may relieve the maternal symptoms, they definitively cross the placenta partially influencing the neurodevelopment of the fetus. In this review an overview is given of the effects on the offspring of maternal antenatal depression and the putative neurodevelopmental effects of SSRI treatment during pregnancy. Although we primarily focus on human data, some animal data are discussed to describe possible mechanisms on how SSRIs are affecting underlying biological mechanisms associated with depression. In summary, maternal depression may have long-lasting effects on the offspring, whereas prenatal SSRI exposure also increases the risk for long-lasting effects. It remains to be determined whether the effects found after SSRI treatment in pregnant women are only due to the SSRI exposure or if the underlying depression is also contributing to these effects. The possibility of epigenetic alterations as one of the underlying mechanisms that is altered by SSRI exposure is discussed. However much more research in this area is needed to explain the exact role of epigenetic mechanisms in SSRI exposure during pregnancy. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Antenatal depression; Antidepressants; Epigenetics; Neurodevelopment; Pregnancy; SSRI","Abrams, S.M., Field, T., Scafidi, F., Prodromidis, M., Newborns of depressed mothers (1995) Infant Ment.

Abnormalities in DAT-mediated DA clearance have been linked to a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including addiction, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Membrane trafficking of DAT appears to be an important, albeit incompletely understood, post-translational regulatory mechanism; its dysregulation has been recently proposed as a potential risk determinant of these disorders. In this study, we demonstrate a link between an ADHD-associated DAT mutation (Arg615Cys, R615C) and variation on DAT transporter cell surface dynamics, a combination only previously studied with ensemble biochemical and optical approaches that featured limited spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we utilize high-affinity, DAT-specific antagonist-conjugated quantum dot (QD) probes to establish the dynamic mobility of wild-type and mutant DATs at the plasma membrane of living cells. Single DAT-QD complex trajectory analysis revealed that the DAT 615C variant exhibited increased membrane mobility relative to DAT 615R, with diffusion rates comparable to those observed after lipid raft disruption. This phenomenon was accompanied by a loss of transporter mobilization triggered by amphetamine, a common component of ADHD medications. Together, our data provides the first dynamic imaging of single DAT proteins, providing new insights into the relationship between surface dynamics and trafficking of both wild-type and disease-associated transporters. Our approach should be generalizable to future studies that explore the possibilities of perturbed surface DAT dynamics that may arise as a consequence of genetic alterations, regulatory changes, and drug use that contribute to the etiology or treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Here, a mass spectrometry-based approach was used to identify Ca2+-dependent and -independent in vitro autophosphorylation sites in recombinant CaMKIIα and CaMKIIβ. CaMKII holoenzymes were then immunoprecipitated from subcellular fractions of forebrains isolated from either wild-type (WT) mice or mice with a Thr286 to Ala knock-in mutation of CaMKIIα (T286A-KI mice) and analyzed using the same approach in order to characterize in vivo phosphorylation sites in both CaMKII isoforms and identify CaMKII-associated proteins (CaMKAPs). A total of six and seven autophosphorylation sites in CaMKIIα and CaMKIIβ, respectively, were detected in WT mice. Thr286-phosphorylated CaMKIIα and Thr287-phosphorylated CaMKIIβ were selectively enriched in WT Triton-insoluble (synaptic) fractions compared to Triton-soluble (membrane) and cytosolic fractions. In contrast, Thr306-phosphorylated CaMKIIα and Ser315- and Thr320/Thr321-phosphorylated CaMKIIβ were selectively enriched in WT cytosolic fractions. The T286A-KI mutation significantly reduced levels of phosphorylation of CaMKIIα at Ser275 across all subcellular fractions and of cytosolic CaMKIIβ at Ser315 and Thr320/Thr321. Significantly more CaMKAPs coprecipitated with WT CaMKII holoenzymes in the synaptic fraction compared to that in the membrane fraction, with functions including scaffolding, microtubule organization, actin organization, ribosomal function, vesicle trafficking, and others. The T286A-KI mutation altered the interactions of multiple CaMKAPs with CaMKII, including several proteins linked to autism spectrum disorders.

Here we show, using genetically engineered mice, that the Cdc42 GTPase-activating multiadaptor protein, NOMA-GAP, regulates autism-like social behavior in the mouse, as well as dendritic spine and synapse development. Surprisingly, we were unable to restore spine morphology or autism-associated social behavior in NOMA-GAP-deficient animals by Cre-mediated deletion of Cdc42 alone. Spine morphology can be restored in vivo by re-expression of wild-type NOMA-GAP or a mutant of NOMA-GAP that lacks the RhoGAP domain, suggesting that other signaling functions are involved. Indeed, we show that NOMA-GAP directly interacts with several MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) proteins, and that this modulates NOMA-GAP activity toward Cdc42. Moreover, we demonstrate that NOMA-GAP is a major regulator of PSD-95 in the neocortex. Loss of NOMA-GAP leads to strong upregulation of serine 295 phosphorylation of PSD-95 and moreover to its subcellular mislocalization. This is associated with marked loss of surface α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor and defective synaptic transmission, thereby providing a molecular basis for autism-like social behavior in the absence of NOMA-GAP.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 14 April 2015; doi:10.1038/mp.2015.42. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927943937

A central feature of human social cognition is a theory-of-mind (ToM) that enables the representation other people'smental states as distinct fromone's own. Numerous neuroimaging studies of the best studied use of ToM - false-belief reasoning - suggest that it relies on a specific cortical network; moreover, the amygdala is structurally and functionally connected with many components of this cortical network. It remains unknown whether the cortical implementation of any form of ToM depends on amygdala function. Here we investigated this question directly by conducting functional MRI on two patients with rare bilateral amygdala lesions while they performed a neuroimaging protocol standardized for measuring cortical activity associated with false-belief reasoning. We compared patient responses with those of two healthy comparison groups that included 480 adults. Based on both univariate and multivariate comparisons, neither patient showed any evidence of atypical cortical activity or any evidence of atypical behavioral performance; moreover, this pattern of typical cortical and behavioral response was replicated for both patients in a follow-up session. These findings argue that the amygdala is not necessary for the cortical implementation of ToM in adulthood and suggest a reevaluation of the role of the amygdala and its cortical interactions in human social cognition. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

MeCP2 plays a critical role in neuronal differentiation, neural development, and synaptic plasticity. Mutations and duplications of the human MECP2 gene lead to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome and autism. In this study we investigate the role of MeCP2 in the spinal cord and found that MeCP2 plays an important role as an analgesic mediator in pain circuitry. Findings: Experiments using MeCP2 transgenic mice showed that overexpression of MeCP2 weakens both acute mechanical pain and thermal pain, suggesting an analgesic role of MeCP2 in acute pain transduction. We found that through p-CREB/miR-132 signaling cascade is involved in MeCP2-mediated pain transduction. We also examined the role of MeCP2 in chronic pain formation using spared nerve injury (SNI) model. Strikingly, we found that development of neuropathic pain attenuates in MeCP2 transgenic mice comparing to wild type (WT) mice. Conclusions: Our study shows that MeCP2 plays an analgesic role in both acute pain transduction and chronic pain formation through regulating CREB-miR-132 pathway. This work provides a potential therapeutic target for neural pathologic pain, and also sheds new lights on the abnormal sensory mechanisms associated with autism spectrum orders. © Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Acute pain;

The number of marbles that animals bury are count data (non-negative integers), which are bounded below by zero and above by the number of marbles present. Count data are often analysed using normal linear models, which include the t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) as special cases. Linear models assume that the data are unbounded and that the variance is constant across groups. These requirements are rarely met with count data, leading to 95% confidence intervals that include impossible values (less than zero or greater than the number of marbles present), misleading p-values, and impossible predictions. Transforming the data or using nonparametric methods are common alternatives but transformations do not perform well when many zero values are present and nonparametric methods have several drawbacks. Findings: The problems with using normal linear models to analyse marble burying data are demonstrated and generalised linear models (GLMs) are introduced as more appropriate alternatives. Conclusions: GLMs have been specifically developed to deal with count and other types of non-Gaussian data, are straightforward to use and interpret, and will lead to more sensible inferences. © 2015 Lazic;

Several preclinical studies in mouse models have identified rational molecular targets for drug therapies aimed at correcting the underlying neural dysfunction.

The investigation also involved family members to explore their level of awareness of the adolescents’ dependency preferences. The grids were analyzed using a range of measures, including the uncertainty index and partial order scalogram analysis. Findings indicate the adolescents had various ways of dispersing their dependencies among their resources and differed in the types of support most used. Additionally, family members differed in their awareness of the adolescents’ preferences. The benefits and drawbacks of the adolescents’ dependency distribution patterns are discussed, as well as implications of these patterns for family members.

Forty-seven percent of parents reported having tried any CAM approach in the past 6 months. Diets and supplements were used by 25 % of the sample and mind–body practices by 24 %; other unconventional approaches were used by 25 % of the families, and a minority of parents reported having tried any invasive or potentially harmful approach (2 %). Parents in Eastern Europe reported significantly higher rates of CAM use. In the total sample, children with lower verbal ability and children using prescribed medications were more likely to be receiving diets or supplements. Concurrent use of high levels of conventional psychosocial intervention was significantly associated with use of mind–body practices. Higher parental educational level also increased the likelihood of both use of diets and supplements and use of mind–body practices. Conclusion: The high prevalence of CAM use among a sample of young children with ASD is an indication that parents need to be supported in the choice of treatments early on in the assessment process, particularly in some parts of Europe.(Table presented.) © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Autism spectrum disorder; Complementary and alternative medicine; Diets; Europe; Mind–body practices; Supplements",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927537460

Methods: Structured quantitative retrospective chart review and qualitative analysis of case files of all adolescent SR applicants who entered the assessment by the end of 2013. Results: The number of referrals exceeded expectations in light of epidemiological knowledge. Natal girls were markedly overrepresented among applicants. Severe psychopathology preceding onset of gender dysphoria was common. Autism spectrum problems were very common. Conclusion: The findings do not fit the commonly accepted image of a gender dysphoric minor.

While ASDs are highly heritable and demonstrate a clear genetic component, the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving ASD etiology remain undefined. The unavailability of live patient-specific neurons has contributed to the difficulty in studying ASD pathophysiology. The recent advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has provided the ability to generate patient-specific human neurons from somatic cells. The iPSC field has quickly grown, as researchers have demonstrated the utility of this technology to model several diseases, especially neurologic disorders. Here, we review the current literature around using iPSCs to model ASDs, and discuss the notable findings, and the promise and limitations of this technology. The recent report of a nonsyndromic ASD iPSC model and several previous ASD models demonstrating similar results points to the ability of iPSC to reveal potential novel biomarkers and therapeutics. © 2015 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.","Autism spectrum disorders; Brain; Disease modeling; Drug screening; Human induced pluripotent stem cells; Human neurons",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927555918

We report on a female child with a history of severe hypotonia, autism spectrum disorder and mild intellectual disability with severe speech/language impairment. Clinical exome sequencing identified a heterozygous de novo FOXP1 variant c.1267_1268delGT (p.V423Hfs*37). Functional analyses using cellular models show that the variant disrupts multiple aspects of FOXP1 activity, including subcellular localization and transcriptional repression properties. Our findings highlight the importance of performing functional characterization to help uncover the biological significance of variants identified by genomics approaches, thereby providing insight into pathways underlying complex neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, our data support the hypothesis that de novo variants represent significant causal factors in severe sporadic disorders and extend the phenotype seen in individuals with FOXP1 haploinsufficiency.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 8 April 2015; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2015.66. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927537306

The aim was to describe observed atypical behaviours that may be associated with autism spectrum conditions, in a population (n = 4329) of infants at eight months. Observations were performed by paediatric nurses. An observational instrument, named SEEK developed for child health care, was used focusing on social interaction, communication, motor skills, and an interview with parents. The analysis contains descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and a logistic regression model (cut-point 8 SEEK points). Infants scoring 8 points or more were observed a second time by psychologists and judged to be in the risk zone for atypical development. Delayed reaction to stimuli and preverbal language development were significant atypical behaviours together with deficits in communication skills, the latter more often among boys than girls.

However, empirical evidence to date has been mixed, with some studies reporting lower levels of social reward in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and others finding no difference when compared to typically developing controls. Alexithymia, a subclinical condition associated with the reduced ability to identify and describe one's own emotions, has been found to account for other affective difficulties observed inconsistently in individuals with ASD. The current study used a nonclinical sample (N = 472) to explore the associations between autistic traits and the value of six types of social reward, as measured by the Social Reward Questionnaire. In addition, we measured alexithymia to assess if this accounted for associations between autistic traits and social reward. There were three main findings. Firstly, higher levels of autistic traits were associated with significantly less enjoyment of admiration and sociability, and adding alexithymia to these models did not account for any additional variance. Secondly, both autistic traits and alexithymia were uniquely associated with reduced levels of enjoyment of prosocial interactions and sexual relationships. Thirdly, autistic traits were associated with higher levels of enjoyment of passivity and negative social potency, but these associations were no longer significant once alexithymia was taken into account, suggesting that co-occurring alexithymia accounted for these apparent associations. Overall, the current findings provide a novel and more nuanced picture of the relationship between autistic traits and social reward. © 2015 Foulkes et al.",,"Frith, U., Happé, F., Autism spectrum disorder (2005) Curr Biol, 15, pp. R786-R790. , PMID: 16213805; Happé, F., Ronald, A., The 'fractionable autism triad': A review of evidence from behavioural, genetic, cognitive and neural research (2008) Neuropsychol Rev, 18, pp. 287-304. , PMID: 18956240; Baron-Cohen, S., Wheelwright, S., Skinner, R., Martin, J., Clubley, E., The autism-spectrum quotient (AQ): Evidence from asperger syndrome/high-functioning autism, males and females, scientists and mathematicians (2001) J Autism Dev Disord, 31, pp. 5-17. , PMID: 11439754; Chevallier, C., Kohls, G., Troiani, V., Brodkin, E.S., Schultz, R.T., The social motivation theory of autism (2012) Trends Cogn Sci, 16, pp. 231-239. , PMID: 22425667; Dawson, G., Webb, S.J., McPartland, J., Understanding the nature of face processing impairment in autism: Insights from behavioral and electrophysiological studies (2005) Dev Neuropsychol, 27, pp. 403-424. , PMID: 15843104; Foulkes, L., McCrory, E.J., Neumann, C.S., Viding, E., Inverted social reward: Associations between psychopathic traits and self-report and experimental measures of social reward (2014) PLOS ONE; Deckers, A., Roelofs, J., Muris, P., Rinck, M., Desire for social interaction in children with autism spectrum disorders (2014) Res Autism Spect Dis, 8, pp. 449-453; Chevallier, C., Grèzes, J., Molesworth, C., Berthoz, S., Happé, F., Brief report: Selective social anhedonia in high functioning autism (2012) J Autism Dev Disord, 42, pp. 1504-1509. , PMID: 21986875; Berthoz, S., Lalanne, C., Crane, L., Hill, E.L., Investigating emotional impairments in adults with autism spectrum disorders and the broader autism phenotype (2013) Psychiatry Res, 208, pp. 257-264. , PMID: 23747233; Richey, J.A., Rittenberg, A., Hughes, L., Damiano, C.R., Sabatino, A., Miller, S., Common and distinct neural features of social and non-social reward processing in autism and social anxiety disorder (2014) Soc Cogn Affect Neur, 9, pp. 366-377; Delmonte, S., Balsters, J.H., McGrath, J., Fitzgerald, J., Brennan, S., Fagan, A.J., Social and monetary reward processing in autism spectrum disorders (2012) Mol Autism, 3, p. 7. , PMID: 23014171; Zeeland, S.V., Ashley, A., Dapretto, M., Ghahremani, D.G., Poldrack, R.A., Bookheimer, S.Y., Reward processing in autism (2010) Autism Res, 3, pp. 53-67. , PMID: 20437601; Stavropoulos, K.K., Carver, L.J., Reward anticipation and processing of social versus nonsocial stimuli in children with and without autism spectrum disorders (2014) J Child Psychol Psyc.; Ewing, L., Pellicano, E., Rhodes, G., Using effort to measure reward value of faces in children with autism (2013) PLOS ONE; Pankert, A., Pankert, K., Herpertz-Dahlmann, B., Konrad, K., Kohls, G., Responsivity to familiar versus unfamiliar social reward in children with autism (2014) J Neural Transm, 121, pp. 1199-1210. , PMID: 24728874; Kohls, G., Chevallier, C., Troiani, V., Schultz, R.T., Social 'wanting' dysfunction in autism: Neurobiological underpinnings and treatment implications (2012) J Neurodev Disord, 4, pp. 1-20. , PMID: 22958445; Lam, K.S., Aman, M.G., Arnold, L.E., Neurochemical correlates of autistic disorder: A review of the literature (2006) Res Dev Disabil, 27, pp. 254-289. , PMID: 16002261; Robinson, E.B., Koenen, K.C., McCormick, M.C., Munir, K., Hallett, V., Happé, F., A multivariate twin study of autistic traits in 12-year-olds: Testing the fractionable autism triad hypothesis (2012) Behav Genet, 42, pp. 245-255. , PMID: 21927971; Wing, L., Gould, J., Severe impairments of social interaction and associated abnormalities in children: Epidemiology and classification (1979) J Autism Dev Disord, 9, pp. 11-29. , PMID: 155684; Taylor, G.J., Recent developments in alexithymia theory and research (2000) Can J Psychiat, 45, pp. 134-142; Berthoz, S., Pouga, L., Wessa, M., Alexithymia from the social neuroscience perspective (2011) The Handbook of Social Neuroscience., pp. 906-934. , Decety J, Cacioppo J Oxford University Press: Oxford; Bourke, M.P., Taylor, G.J., Parker, J.D., Bagby, R.M., Alexithymia in women with anorexia nervosa.

Studying the genes involved can provide insight into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of ASD. 2q23.1 deletion syndrome (causative gene, MBD5) is a recently identified genetic neurodevelopmental disorder associated with ASD. Mutations in MBD5 have been found in ASD cohorts. In this study, we provide a phenotypic update on the prevalent features of 2q23.1 deletion syndrome, which include severe intellectual disability, seizures, significant speech impairment, sleep disturbance, and autistic-like behavioral problems. Next, we examined the phenotypic, molecular, and network/pathway relationships between nine neurodevelopmental disorders associated with ASD: 2q23.1 deletion Rett, Angelman, Pitt-Hopkins, 2q23.1 duplication, 5q14.3 deletion, Kleefstra, Kabuki make-up, and Smith-Magenis syndromes. We show phenotypic overlaps consisting of intellectual disability, speech delay, seizures, sleep disturbance, hypotonia, and autistic-like behaviors. Molecularly, MBD5 possibly regulates the expression of UBE3A, TCF4, MEF2C, EHMT1 and RAI1. Network analysis reveals that there could be indirect protein interactions, further implicating function for these genes in common pathways. Further, we show that when MBD5 and RAI1 are haploinsufficient, they perturb several common pathways that are linked to neuronal and behavioral development. These findings support further investigations into the molecular and pathway relationships among genes linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and ASD, which will hopefully lead to common points of regulation that may be targeted toward therapeutic intervention. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","ASD; EHMT1; MBD5; MEF2C; Network analysis; Networks; Overlapping phenotypes; Pathways; RAI1; TCF4; Transcriptional regulation; UBE3A","Spooren, W., Lindemann, L., Ghosh, A., Santarelli, L., Synapse dysfunction in autism: A molecular medicine approach to drug discovery in neurodevelopmental disorders (2012) Trends Pharmacol.

ASD-Sibs and TD-Sibs demonstrated similar emotional/behavioral adjustment. Older male ASD-Sibs were at increased risk for difficulties. Sibling relationships of ASD-Sibs involved less aggression, less involvement, and more avoidance than those of TD-Sibs. Partial support for a diathesis–stress conceptualization of sibling difficulties was found for ASD-Sibs. For TD-Sibs, broader autism phenotype (BAP) was related to psychosocial difficulties regardless of family stressors. For ASD-Sibs, BAP was related to difficulties only when family stressors were present. This suggests that having a sibling with ASD may be a protective factor that attenuates the negative impact of sibling BAP. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Adjustment; Diathesis–stress; Relationship; Risk factors; Siblings",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926660886

Support groups enable them to access psycho-education and social support. Barriers to this can include the distance they have to travel to meet face-to-face. Audio-conferencing, whereby three or more people can connect by telephone in different locations, is an efficient means of groups meeting and warrants exploration in this healthcare context. This study explored the feasibility of audio-conferencing as a method of facilitating sibling support groups Methods: A longitudinal design was adopted. Participants were six siblings (aged eight to thirteen years) and parents of children with complex neurodevelopmental disorders attending the Centre for Interventional Paediatric Psychopharmacology (CIPP). Four of the eight one-hour weekly sessions were held face-to-face and the other four using audio-conferencing. Pre- and post-intervention questionnaires and interviews were completed and three to six month follow-up interviews were carried out. The sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed and thematic analysis was undertaken. Results: Audio-conferencing as a form of telemedicine was acceptable to all six participants and was effective in facilitating sibling support groups. Audio-conferencing can overcome geographical barriers to children being able to receive group therapeutic healthcare interventions such as social support and psycho-education. Psychopathology ratings increased post-intervention in some participants. Siblings reported that communication between siblings and their family members increased and siblings' social network widened. Conclusions: Audio-conferencing is an acceptable, feasible and effective method of facilitating sibling support groups. Siblings' clear accounts of neuropsychiatric symptoms render them reliable informants. Systematic assessment of siblings' needs and strengthened links between Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, school counsellors and young carers groups are warranted. © Gettings et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Autism Spectrum Disorder; Behavioural problems; Chronic illness; Complex neurodevelopmental disorders; Neurodisability; Sibling; Support group; Telemedicine; Young carer","Costello, E.J., Egger, H., Angold, A., 10-year research update review: the epidemiology of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders: 1.

Purpura Department of Neuroscience, Albert Einstein College of MedicineBronx, New York, NY, United States","Fragile X Syndrome, a leading cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism, arises from transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene encoding an RNA-binding protein, Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). FMRP can regulate the expression of approximately 4% of brain transcripts through its role in regulation of mRNA transport, stability and translation, thus providing a molecular rationale for its potential pleiotropic effects on neuronal and brain circuitry function. Several intracellular signaling pathways are dysregulated in the absence of FMRP suggesting that cellular deficits may be broad and could result in homeostatic changes. Lipid rafts are specialized regions of the plasma membrane, enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, involved in regulation of intracellular signaling. Among transcripts targeted by FMRP, a subset encodes proteins involved in lipid biosynthesis and homeostasis, dysregulation of which could affect the integrity and function of lipid rafts. Using a quantitative mass spectrometry-based approach we analyzed the lipid raft proteome of Fmr1 knockout mice, an animal model of Fragile X syndrome, and identified candidate proteins that are differentially represented in Fmr1 knockout mice lipid rafts. Furthermore, network analysis of these candidate proteins reveals connectivity between them and predicts functional connectivity with genes encoding components of myelin sheath, axonal processes and growth cones. Our findings provide insight to aid identification of molecular and cellular dysfunctions arising from Fmr1 silencing and for uncovering shared pathologies between Fragile X syndrome and other autism spectrum disorders. © 2015 Kalinowska et al.",,"Neale, B.M., Kou, Y., Liu, L., Ma'Ayan, A., Samocha, K.E., Sabo, A., Patterns and rates of exonic de novo mutations in autism spectrum disorders (2012) Nature, 485 (7397), pp. 242-245. , MID: 22495311;

Here, we retrieved 17 104 DNMs from 3555 trios across four neuropsychiatric disorders: autism spectrum disorder, epileptic encephalopathy, intellectual disability and schizophrenia, in addition to unaffected siblings (control), from 36 studies by WES/WGS. After eliminating non-exonic variants, we focused on 3334 exonic DNMs for evaluation of their association with these diseases. Our results revealed a higher prevalence of DNMs in the probands of all four disorders compared with the one in the controls (P&lt;1.3 × 10-7). The elevated DNM frequency is dominated by loss-of-function/deleterious single-nucleotide variants and frameshift indels (that is, extreme mutations, P&lt;4.5 × 10-5). With extensive annotation of these ‘extreme’ mutations, we prioritized 764 candidate genes in these four disorders. A combined analysis of Gene Ontology, microRNA targets and transcription factor targets revealed shared biological process and non-coding regulatory elements of candidate genes in the pathology of neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, weighted gene co-expression network analysis of human laminar-specific neocortical expression data showed that candidate genes are convergent on eight shared modules with specific layer enrichment and biological process features. Furthermore, we identified that 53 candidate genes are associated with more than one disorder (P&lt;0.000001), suggesting a possibly shared genetic etiology underlying these disorders. Particularly, DNMs of the SCN2A gene are frequently occurred across all four disorders. Finally, we constructed a freely available NPdenovo database, which provides a comprehensive catalog of the DNMs identified in neuropsychiatric disorders.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 7 April 2015; doi:10.1038/mp.2015.40. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927534358

Defining autism as a disability was more than a change of legal status to guarantee social benefits. It was also a political maneuver, orchestrated by parent associations, aimed to take the responsibility for treatment away from the public mental health network of services. This article examines the controversies that have set parent associations in direct antagonism with mental health professionals in the public health system. We draw from ethnographic data and theoretical discussions in the field of disability studies to situate these controversies within the context of a larger debate on the relationship between health, rights, and citizenship. We found similarities between the ethical and political goals of parent activists and mental health professionals in Brazil, but we argue that the main cause of dissent is the role that each of these social actors assigns to identity politics in their clinical and political projects. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Autism; Disability; Identity politics; Mental health; Public policies",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926289393

Developed in 1927, it has been and is still being used as a preservative in some cosmetics, topical pharmaceuticals, and biological drug products, including vaccines. Concerns have been voiced about its use because it is toxic to human cells. Although it is banned in several countries, it continues to be added to some vaccines in the United States and many vaccines in the developing world. Discussion: This critical review focuses on the clinical, epidemiological, and biochemical studies of adverse effects from Thimerosal in developing humans. This review will include research that examines fetal, infant, and childhood death; birth defects; neurodevelopmental testing deficits in children; and neurodevelopmental disorders (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, tic disorder, and specific developmental delays). The review will also look at the research that examined the outcomes of acute accidental ethyl-Hg poisoning in humans. The studies that examine the underlying biochemical insights into the neuronal cellular damage will also be explored. Conclusion: The culmination of the research that examines the effects of Thimerosal in humans indicates that it is a poison at minute levels with a plethora of deleterious consequences, even at the levels currently administered in vaccines. © 2015 .","Ethylmercury; Humans; Neurodevelopment; Thimerosal","Tan, M., Parkin, J.E., Route of decomposition of thiomersal (thimerosal) (2000) Int J Pharm, 208 (1-2), pp. 23-34; Geier, D.A., Sykes, L.K., Geier, M.R., A review of Thimerosal (Merthiolate) and its ethylmercury breakdown product: specific historical considerations regarding safety and effectiveness (2007) J Toxicol Environ Health B Crit Rev, 10 (8), pp. 575-596; Morton, H.E., North, L.L., Engley, J.B., The bacteriostatic actions of some mercurial compounds on hemolytic streptococci (1948) J Am Med Assoc, 136 (1), pp. 37-41; Mercurials as ""preservatives"" (1948) J Am Med Assoc, 122 (8), p. 1253. , Anonymous; Stetler, H.C., Garbe, P.L., Dwyer, D.M., Outbreaks of group A streptococcal abscesses following diphtheria-tetanus toxoid-pertussis vaccination (1985) Pediatrics, 72 (2), pp. 299-303; Khandke, L., Yang, C., Krylova, K., Jansen, K.U., Rashidbaigi, A., Preservative of choice for Prev(e)nar 13™ in a multi-dose formulation (2011) Vaccine, 29 (41), pp. 7144-7153; Geier, D.A., Jordan, S.K., Geier, M.R., The relative toxicity of compounds used as preservatives in vaccines and biologics (2010) Med Sci Monit, 16 (5), pp. SR21-SR27; Kern, J.K., Geier, D.A., Ayzac, F., Adams, J.B., Mehta, J.A., Geier, M.R., Toxicity biomarkers among US children compared to a similar cohort in France: a blinded study measuring urinary porphyrins (2011) Toxicol Environ Chem, 93 (1-2), pp. 396-405; Bigham, M., Copes, R., Thiomersal in vaccines: balancing the risk of adverse effects with the risk of vaccine-preventable disease (2005) Drug Saf, 28 (2), pp. 89-101; Kern, J.K., Haley, B.E., Geier, D.A., Sykes, L.K., King, P.G., Geier, M.R., Thimerosal exposure and the role of sulfation chemistry and thiol availability in autism (2013) Int J Environ Res Public Health, 10 (8), pp. 3771-3800; Studies that show harm from Thimerosal, , http://mercury-freedrugs.org/docs/20141212_KernJK_ExcelFile_TMs_Harm_Refs_%20v43_secure.xlsx, [Updated 12/12/2014.

These similarities suggest the guinea pig as a promising model of fetal behavioral development as well. Using innovative methods of behavioral acclimation, fetal offspring of female IAF hairless guinea pigs time mated to NIH multicolored Hartley males were observed longitudinally without restraint using noninvasive ultrasound at weekly intervals across the 10 week gestation. To ensure that the ultrasound procedure did not cause significant stress, salivary cortisol was collected both before and after each observation. Measures of fetal spontaneous movement and behavioral state were quantified from video recordings from week 3 through the last week before birth. Results from prenatal quantification of Interlimb Movement Synchrony and state organization reveal guinea pig fetal development to be strikingly similar to that previously reported for other rodents and preterm human infants. Salivary cortisol readings taken before and after sonography did not differ at any observation time point. These results suggest this model holds translational promise for studying the prenatal mechanisms of neurobehavioral development, including those that may result from adverse events. Because the guinea pig is a highly social mammal with a wide range of socially oriented vocalizations, this model may also have utility for studying the prenatal origins and trajectories of developmental disabilities with social-emotional components, such as autism. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cortisol; Fetal movement; Interlimb coordination; Prenatal behavior; Restraint stress","Barker, D.J., The intrauterine origins of cardiovascular disease (1993) Acta Paediatr Suppl, 82, pp. 93-99; Nathanielsz, P.W., Animal models that elucidate basic principles of the developmental origins of adult diseases (2006) ILAR J, 47, pp. 73-82; DiPietro, J.A., Neurobehavioral assessment before birth (2005) Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev, 11, pp. 4-13; Economic costs associated with mental retardation, cerebral palsy, hearing loss, and vision impairment - United States (2004) MMWR, pp. 57-59; Kleven, G.A., Bellinger, S.A., Developmental pathways of motor dysfunction (2015) Dev Psychobiol, , [in press]; van Kan, C.M., de Vries, J.I.P., Luchinger, A.B., Mulder, E.J.H., Taverne, M.A.M., Ontogeny of fetal movements in the guinea pig (2009) Physiol Behav, 98, pp. 338-344; Sekulic, S.R., Lukac, D., Drapsin, M., Capo, I., Lalosevic, D., Novakov-Mikic, A., Ultrasonographic observations of the maturation of basic movements in guinea pig fetuses (2009) Cent Eur J Biol, 4, pp. 58-61; Wagner, J.E., Manning, P.J., (1976) The biology of the guinea pig, p. 374. , Academic Press, New York; Carter, A.M., Animal models of human placentation - a review (2007) Placenta, 28, pp. S41-S47; Sachser, N., Of domestic and wild guinea pigs: studies in sociophysiology, domestication, and social evolution (1998) Naturwissenschaften, 85, pp. 307-317; Willis, F.N., Levinson, D.M., Buchanan, D.R., Development of social behavior in the guinea-pig (1977) Psychol Rec, 27, pp. 527-536; Arvola, A., Vocalization in the guinea-pig cavia-porcellus (1974) Ann Zool Fenn, 11, pp. 1-96; Berryman, J.C., Guinea-pig vocalizations their structure causation and function (1976) Z Tierpsychol, 41, pp. 80-106; Fisler, G.F., Communication systems and organizational systems in 3 species of rodents (1970) Bull South Calif Acad Sci, 69, pp. 43-51; Kober, M., Trillmich, F., Naguib, M., Vocal mother-pup communication in guinea pigs: effects of call familiarity and female reproductive state (2007) Anim Behav, 73, pp. 917-925; Monticelli, P.F., Tokumaru, R.S., Ades, C., Isolation induced changes in guinea pig Cavia porcellus pup distress whistles (2004) An Acad Bras Cienc, 76, pp. 368-372; Tokumaru, R.S., Ades, C., Monticelli, P.F., Individual differences in infant guinea pig pups isolation whistles (2004) Bioacoustics, 14, pp. 197-208; Hennessy, M.B., Enduring maternal influences in a precocial rodent (2003) Dev Psychobiol, 42, pp. 225-236; Hennessy, M.B., Deak, T., Schiml-Webb, P.A., Wilson, S.E., Greenlee, T.M., McCall, E., Responses of guinea pig pups during isolation in a novel environment may represent stress-induced sickness behaviors (2004) Physiol Behav, 81, pp. 5-13; Bennett, G.A., Palliser, H.K., Saxby, B., Walker, D.W., Hirst, J.J., Effects of prenatal stress on fetal neurodevelopment and responses to maternal neurosteroid treatment in guinea pigs (2013) Dev Neurosci, 35, pp. 416-426; Hennessy, M.B., Hornschuh, G., Kaiser, S., Sachser, N., Cortisol responses and social buffering: a study throughout the life span (2006) Horm Behav, 49, pp. 383-390; Kapoor, A., Kostaki, A., Janus, C., Matthews, S.G., The effects of prenatal stress on learning in adult offspring is dependent on the timing of the stressor (2009) Behav Brain Res, 197, pp. 144-149; Kapoor, A., Matthews, S.G., Prenatal stress modifies behavior and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function in female guinea pig offspring: effects of timing of prenatal stress and stage of reproductive cycle (2008) Endocrinology, 149, pp. 6406-6415; Pettijohn, T.F., Attachment and separation distress in the infant guinea-pig (1978) Dev Psychobiol, 12, pp. 73-82; Sekulić, S., Lukac, D., Drabsin, M., Suknjaja, V., Keković, G., Grbić, G., The righting reflex from a supine to a prone position in the guinea pig fetus (2009) Gen Physiol Biophys, 28. , [Spec No:284-8]; Buynitsky, T., Mostofsky, D.I., Restraint stress in biobehavioral research: recent developments (2009) Neurosci Biobehav Rev, 33, pp. 1089-1098; Nathanielsz, P.W., Berghorn, K.A., Derks, J.B., Giussani, D.A., Docherty, C., Unno, N., Life before birth: effects of cortisol on future cardiovascular and metabolic function (2003) Acta Paediatr, 92, pp. 766-772; Kleven, G.A., Lane, M.S., Robinson, S.R., Development of interlimb movement synchrony in the rat fetus (2004) Behav Neurosci, 118, pp. 835-844; Kleven, G.A., Ronca, A.E., Prenatal behavior of the C57BL/6J mouse: a promising model for human fetal movement during early to mid-gestation (2009) Dev Psychobiol, 51, pp. 84-94; Banks, R., (1989) The guinea pig: biology, care, identification, nomenclature, breeding, and genetics.

We hypothesize that deleterious variants at conserved residues are enriched in severely affected patients arising from female-enriched multiplex families with severe disease, enhancing the detection of key autism genes in modest numbers of cases. Here we show the use of this strategy by identifying missense and dosage sequence variants in the gene encoding the adhesive junction-associated δ-catenin protein (CTNND2) in female-enriched multiplex families and demonstrating their loss-of-function effect by functional analyses in zebrafish embryos and cultured hippocampal neurons from wild-type and Ctnnd2 null mouse embryos. Finally, through gene expression and network analyses, we highlight a critical role for CTNND2 in neuronal development and an intimate connection to chromatin biology. Our data contribute to the understanding of the genetic architecture of autism and suggest that genetic analyses of phenotypic extremes, such as female-enriched multiplex families, are of innate value in multifactorial disorders. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Stress levels of 38 primary carers acquiring a dog and 24 controls not acquiring a dog were sampled at: Pre-intervention (17 weeks before acquiring a dog), post-intervention (3–10 weeks after acquisition) and follow-up (25–40 weeks after acquisition), using the Parenting Stress Index. Analysis revealed significant improvements in the intervention compared to the control group for Total Stress, Parental Distress and Difficult Child. A significant number of parents in the intervention group moved from clinically high to normal levels of Parental Distress.

Although a high prevalence of autistic-like traits/symptoms has been identified in the pediatric psychiatric population of normal intelligence, there are no reports from adult psychiatric population. This study examined whether there is a greater prevalence of autistic-like traits/symptoms in patients with adult-onset psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia, and whether such an association is independent of symptom severity. The subjects were 290 adults of normal intelligence between 25 and 59 years of age (MDD, n=125; bipolar disorder, n=56; schizophrenia, n=44; healthy controls, n=65). Autistic-like traits/symptoms were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale for Adults. Symptom severity was measured using the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and/or the Young Mania Rating Scale. Almost half of the clinical subjects, except those with remitted MDD, exhibited autistic-like traits/symptoms at levels typical for sub-threshold or threshold autism spectrum disorder. Furthermore, the proportion of psychiatric patients that demonstrated high autistic-like traits/symptoms was significantly greater than that of healthy controls, and not different between that of remitted or unremitted subjects with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. On the other hand, remitted subjects with MDD did not differ from healthy controls with regard to the prevalence or degree of high autistic-like traits/symptoms. A substantial proportion of adults with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia showed high autistic-like traits/symptoms independent of symptom severity, suggesting a shared pathophysiology among autism spectrum disorder and these psychiatric disorders. Conversely, autistic-like traits among subjects with MDD were associated with the depressive symptom severity. These findings suggest the importance of evaluating autistic-like traits/symptoms underlying adult-onset psychiatric disorders for the best-suited treatment. Further studies with a prospective design and larger samples are needed.

Gut bacteria play an important role in human health, such as supplying essential nutrients, synthesizing vitamin K, aiding in the digestion of cellulose, and promoting angiogenesis and enteric nerve function. However, they can also be potentially harmful due to the change of their composition when the gut ecosystem undergoes abnormal changes in the light of the use of antibiotics, illness, stress, aging, bad dietary habits, and lifestyle. Dysbiosis of the gut bacteria communities can cause many chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, cancer, and autism.

Over the past five years, the authors have been designing, developing, and pilot-testing pervasive technology to support several dimensions of the therapy cycle of children with autism, including augmented reality to support cognition, ambient displays to encourage positive behaviors, and exergames to support motor development. They have gradually deployed a range of technologies in a school clinic, where 15 physiologist-teachers serve nearly 60 children with autism. Their effort is showing how smart environments can positively impact current therapeutic practices. In this article, the authors reflect on their experiences creating this smart environment. They also discuss their deployment process and demonstrate that their smart environment is easy to use, useful, supports sustained empirical measurement and iterative development, and offers numerous educational and therapeutic benefits for children with autism. They close with a discussion of potential application themes as future work.

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical significance of plasma neopterin levels in ASD. Methods: Eighty patients diagnosed with ASD and 80 sex and age matched typically developing children were assessed for plasma levels of neopterin at admission. Plasma neopterin levels were measured using a human ELISA kit and severity of ASD were evaluated with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score. Results: We found that the mean plasma neopterin level was significantly (P<. 0.0001) higher in children with ASD as compared to controls. Plasma neopterin increased with increasing severity of ASD as defined by the CARS score. Based on the ROC curve, the optimal cutoff value of plasma neopterin level as an indicator for auxiliary diagnosis of ASD was projected to be 8.5. nmol/L, which yielded a sensitivity of 84.2% and a specificity of 80.1%, with the area under the curve at 0.876 (95% CI, 0.825-0.928). Elevated neopterin (≥8.5. nmol/L) was an independent diagnosis indicator of ASD with an adjusted OR of 12.11 (95% CI: 5.48-28.11; P<. 0.0001). Conclusions: These results indicated that autistic children had higher plasma levels of neopterin, and elevated plasma neopterin levels may be associated with severity of ASD among Chinese children. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Autism spectrum disorders; Diagnosis; Immune system; Inflammation; Neopterin","(2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc., Arlington, VA; Abrahams, B.S., Geschwind, D.H., Advances in autism genetics: on the threshold of a new neurobiology (2008) Nat.

Developing pharmacologic treatments for ASD is complicated by clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Although pharmacological treatments have not been shown to be effective in treating the core symptoms of ASD (i.e., social deficits), there is evidence that the burden of emotional and behavioral problems can be reduced with pharmacotherapy. Numerous randomized clinical trials of treatments for the core ASD deficits have been conducted; however, most have provided inconclusive results due to the substantial variation in treatment response. Variation also exists in the considerable metabolic side effects of many of the current treatments. Some of this variation may be explained by differences in the underlying genetic pathways. Exploiting the link between genetic heterogeneity and clinical variation associated with behavioral problems may provide an opportunity for targeted treatment of ASD. In this review, we summarize the recent findings from pharmacogenomics studies of ASD and suggest further how understanding how genetic liability modifies the effect of drugs may present an opportunity to address the challenges of personalized medicine in autism. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,"Santini, A.C., Pierantoni, G.M., Gerlini, R., Iorio, R., Olabinjo, Y., Giovane, A., Glix 13, a new drug acting on glutamatergic pathways in children and animal models of autism spectrum disorders (2014) BioMed Res Int, 2014, p. 234295. , PID: 24605324;

Alexithymia is also associated with empathic deficits in individuals with autism spectrum disorders. Accordingly, a better understanding of alexithymia could elucidate the nature of social-cognitive deficits transdiagnostically. We investigated alexithymia and components of empathy in relation to schizotypal and autism spectrum traits in healthy college students. Specifically, we examined higher-order components of empathic processing that involve perspective taking and other-oriented concern, which are reduced in alexithymia.Higher-order empathic processing was inversely correlated with both schizotypal and autism spectrum traits. Bootstrapping techniques revealed that alexithymia had a significant indirect effect on the relationship between higher-order empathy and these personality traits; thus, alexithymia contributes uniquely to their relationship. These findings suggest alexithymia represents one possible mechanism for the development of empathic deficits in these populations.These results are consistent with the perspective that awareness of one's own emotional state may predicate a successful empathic response to another's. This work highlights the importance of a consideration of alexithymia in elucidating the nature of empathic deficits in various clinical populations, and points to a potential point of social intervention. © 2015.","Alexithymia; Autism spectrum traits; Emotion; Empathy; Empathy; Schizotypy","Bagby, R.M., Parker, J.D.A., Taylor, G.J., The twenty-item Toronto alexithymia scale: I.

This study examined longitudinal relations between early fine motor functioning, visuospatial cognition, exploration, and language development in preschool children with ASD and children with other developmental delays/disorders. The ASD group included 63 children at T1 (Mage. = 27.10 months, SD= 8.71) and 46 children at T2 (Mage. = 45.85 months, SD= 7.16). The DD group consisted of 269 children at T1 (Mage. = 17.99 months, SD= 5.59), and 121 children at T2 (Mage. = 43.51 months, SD= 3.81). A subgroup nested within the total sample was randomly selected and studied in-depth on exploratory behavior. This group consisted of 50 children, 21 children with ASD (Mage. = 27.57, SD= 7.09) and 29 children with DD (Mage. = 24.03 months, SD= 6.42). Fine motor functioning predicted language in both groups. Fine motor functioning was related to visuospatial cognition in both groups and related to object exploration, spatial exploration, and social orientation during exploration only in the ASD group. Visuospatial cognition and all exploration measures were related to both receptive and expressive language in both groups. The findings are in line with the embodied cognition theory, which suggests that cognition emerges from and is grounded in the bodily interactions of an agent with the environment. This study emphasizes the need for researchers and clinicians to consider cognition as emergent from multiple interacting systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Autism; Exploration; Fine motor functioning; Language; Visuospatial cognition","Akshoomoff, N., Use of the Mullen Scales of Early Learning for the assessment of young children with autism spectrum disorders (2006) Child Neuropsychology, 12, pp. 269-277; Altman, D.G., (1991) Practical statistics for medical research, , Chapman and Hall, London; (2000) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC; Antonucci, S.M., Alt, M., A lifespan perspective on semantic processing of concrete concepts: does a sensory/motor model have the potential to bridge the gap (2011) Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience, 11, pp. 551-572; Baranek, G.T., Autism during infancy: A retrospective video analysis of sensory-motor and social behavior at 9-12 months of age (1999) Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 29, pp. 213-224; Baron-Cohen, S., Leslie, A.M., Frith, U., Does the autistic child have a 'theory of mind'?

While no single pharmacologic intervention has successfully targeted the core symptoms of autism, emerging evidence suggests that postnatal environmental manipulations may offer greater therapeutic efficacy. Massage therapy, or tactile stimulation (TS), early in life has repeatedly been shown to be an effective, low-cost, therapeutic approach in ameliorating the cognitive, social, and emotional symptoms of autism. While early TS treatment attenuates many of the behavioral aberrations among children with autism, the neuroanatomical correlates driving such changes are unknown. The present study assessed the therapeutic effects of early TS treatment on behavior and neuroanatomy using the valproic acid (VPA) rodent model of autism. Rats were prenatally exposed to VPA on gestational day 12.5 and received TS shortly following birth. Whereas TS reversed almost all the VPA-induced alterations in neuroanatomy, it failed to do so behaviorally. The TS VPA animals, when compared to VPA animals, did not exhibit altered or improved behavior in the delayed non-match-to-sample T-maze, Whishaw tray reaching, activity box, or elevated plus maze tasks. Anatomically, however, there were significant increases in dendritic branching and spine density in the medial prefrontal cortex, orbital frontal cortex, and amygdala in VPA animals following early TS treatment, suggesting a complete reversal or remediation of the VPA-induced effects in these regions. The results suggest that postnatal TS, during a critical period in development, acts as a powerful reorganization tool that can ameliorate the neuroanatomical consequences of prenatal VPA exposure. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Amygdala; Autism; Dendritic morphology; Prefrontal cortex; Tactile stimulation; Valproic acid","(1994) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC; Schneider, T., Przewlocki, R., Behavioral alterations in rats prenatally exposed to valproic acid: animal model of autism (2005) Neuropsychopharmacology, 30, pp. 80-89; Bromley, R.L., Mawer, G.E., Briggs, M., Cheyne, C., Clayton-Smith, J., García-Fiñana, M., The prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders in children prenatally exposed to antiepileptic drugs (2013) J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry, 84, pp. 637-643; Bath, K.G., Scharfman, H.E., Impact of early life exposure to antiepileptic drugs on neurobehavioral outcomes based on laboratory animal and clinical research (2013) Epilepsy Behav, 26, pp. 427-439; Bromley, R.L., Baker, G.A., Meador, K.J., Cognitive abilities and behavior of children exposed to antiepileptic drugs in utero (2009) Curr Opin Neurol, 22, pp. 162-166; Adab, N., Kini, U., Vinten, J., Ayres, J., Baker, G., Clayton-Smith, J., The longer term outcome of children born to mothers with epilepsy (2004) J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry, 75, pp. 1575-1583; Ornoy, A., Valproic acid in pregnancy: how much are we endangering the embryo and fetus?

Examples of such illnesses include bipolar disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, depression, autism, and chronic fatigue syndrome. Discussion: While the majority of patients with multiple sclerosis appear to have widespread mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired ATP production, the findings in patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, autism, depression, bipolar disorder schizophrenia and chronic fatigue syndrome are less consistent, likely reflecting the fact that these diagnoses do not represent a disease with a unitary pathogenesis and pathophysiology. However, investigations have revealed the presence of chronic oxidative stress to be an almost invariant finding in study cohorts of patients afforded each diagnosis. This state is characterized by elevated reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and/or reduced levels of glutathione, and goes hand in hand with chronic systemic inflammation with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Summary: This paper details mechanisms by which elevated levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species together with elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines could conspire to pave a major road to the development of mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired oxidative metabolism seen in many patients diagnosed with these disorders. © Berk and Morris;

The inbred C58/J strain is a strain of interest for this model and has previously been shown to possess face validity for some of the core traits of autism, including low social behavior and elevated motor stereotypies. Higher order repetitive behaviors have not been extensively studied in this strain, or in mice in general. In this study, we looked for evidence of higher-order repetitive behaviors in the C58/J strain using a novel object assay. This assay utilized a mouse's natural exploratory behavior among unfamiliar objects to identify potential sequencing patterns in motor activity. The motor stereotypies displayed by the C58/J strain during testing were consistent with past studies. The C58/J strain also displayed a high preference for a single object in the round arena assays and the females demonstrating elevated sequencing patterns in the round arena. Although the C58/J strain did not show pervasive evidence of higher-order repetitive behaviors across all measures, there was evidence of higher order repetitive behaviors in certain situations. This study further demonstrates the potential of the C58/J mouse strains as a model for lower-order and potentially, higher-order repetitive behaviors. This study also demonstrates that the shape of the novel object arena can change the behavior displayed by the test animals. Further studies utilizing the C58/J strain and further validation of the novel object assay are warranted. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Autism; C58/J mouse; Higher-order repetitive behavior; Motor stereotypy; Novel object exploration; Open field","(2013) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC; Bodfish, J.W., Symons, F.J., Parker, D.E., Lewis, M.H., Varieties of repetitive behavior in autism: comparisons to mental retardation (2000) J Autism Dev Disord, 30 (3), pp. 237-243; Lewis, M.H., Kim, S., The pathophysiology of restricted repetitive behavior (2009) J Neurodev Disord, 1 (2), pp. 114-132; Lewis, M.H., Bodfish, J.W., Repetitive behavior disorders in autism (1998) Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev, 4, pp. 80-89; Lam, K.S.L., Bodfish, J.W., Piven, J., Evidence for three subtypes of repetitive behavior in autism that differ in familiarity and association with other symptoms (2008) J Child Psychol Psychiatry, 49 (11), pp. 1193-1200; Powell, S.B., Newman, H.A., Pendergast, J.F., Lewis, M.H., A rodent model of spontaneous stereotypy: initial characterization of developmental, environmental, and neurobiological factors (1999) Physiol Behav, 66 (2), pp. 355-363; Powell, S.B., Newman, H.A., McDonald, T.A., Bugenhagen, P., Lewis, M.H., Development of spontaneous stereotyped behavior in deer mice: effects of early and late exposed to a more complex environment (2000) Dev Psychobiol, 37, pp. 100-108; Korff, S., Stein Dan, J., Harvey, B.H., Stereotypic behavior in the deer mouse: pharmacological validation and relevance for obsessive compulsive disorder (2008) Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry, 32, pp. 348-355; Pearson, B., Pobbe, R., Defensor, E., Oasay, L., Bolivar, V., Blanchard, C.D., Motor and cognitive stereotypies in the BTBR T+tf/J mouse model of autism (2010) Genes Brain Behav, pp. 1-25; McFarlane, H.G., Kusek, G.K., Yang, M., Phoenix, J.L., Bolivar, V.J., Crawley, J.N., Autism-like behavioral phenotypes in BTBR T+tf/J mice (2008) Genes Brain Behav, 7, pp. 152-163; Pobbe, R.L.H., Pearson, B.L., Defensor, E.B., Bolivar, V.J., Blanchard, D.C., Blanchard, R.J., Expression of social behaviors of C57BL/6J versus BTBR inbred mouse strain in the visible burrow system (2010) Behav Brain Res, 214 (2), pp. 443-449; Silverman, J.L., Tolu, S.S., Barkan, C.L., Crawley, J.N., Repetitive self-grooming behavior in the BTBR mouse model of autism is blocked by the mGluR5 Antagonist MPEP (2010) Neuropsychopharmacology, 35, pp. 976-989; Moy, S.S., Nadler, J.J., Young, N.B., Nonneman, R.J., Segall, S.K., Andrade, G.M., Social approach and repetitive behavior in eleven inbred mouse strains (2008) Behav Brain Res, 191 (1), pp. 118-129; Moy, S.S., Riddick, N.V., Nikolova, V.D., Teng, B.L., Agster, K.L., Nonneman, R.J., Repetitive behavior profile and supersensitivity to amphetamine in the C58/J mouse model of autism (2014) Behav Brain Res, 259, pp. 200-214; Muehlmann, A.M., Edington, G., Mihalik, A.C., Buchwald, Z., Koppuzha, D., Korah, M., Further characterization of repetitive behavior in C58 mice: developmental trajectory and effects of environmental enrichment (2012) Behav Brain Res, 235, pp. 143-149; Ryan, B.C., Young, N.B., Crawley, J.N., Bodfish, J.W., Moy, S.S., Social deficits, stereotypy and early emergence of repetitive behavior in the C58/J inbred mouse strain (2010) Behav Brain Res, 206 (1), pp. 178-188; Teng, B.L., Nonneman, R.J., Agster, K.L., Nikolova, V.D., Davis, T.T., Riddick, N.V., Prosocial effects of oxytocin in two mouse models of autism spectrum disorders (2013) Neuropharmacology, 72, pp. 187-196; Lamprea, M.R., Cardenas, F.P., Setem, J., Morato, S., Thigmotactic responses in an open-field (2008) Braz J Med Biol Res, 41, pp. 135-140; Walsh, R.N., Cumins, R.A., The open-field test: a critical review (1976) Psychol Bull, 83 (3), pp. 482-504; Prut, L., Belzung, C., The open field as a paradigm to measure the effects of drugs on anxiety-like behaviors: a review (2003) Eur J Pharmacol, 463, pp. 3-33; FVB/NJ strain information (2013), http://jaxmice.jax.org/strain/001800.html, Retrieved July 23Belzung, C., Measuring exploratory behavior (1999) Handbook of molecular genetic techniques for brain and behavior research (techniques in the behavioral and neural sciences), pp. 739-749. , Elsevier, Amsterdam, W.E.

However, what remains intact may also be important. Increasing evidence suggests that declarative memory, a critical learning and memory system in the brain, remains largely functional in a number of neurodevelopmental disorders. Because declarative memory remains functional in these disorders, and because it can learn and retain numerous types of information, functions, and tasks, this system should be able to play compensatory roles for multiple types of impairments across the disorders. Here, we examine this hypothesis for specific language impairment, dyslexia, autism spectrum disorder, Tourette syndrome, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. We lay out specific predictions for the hypothesis and review existing behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging evidence. Overall, the evidence suggests that declarative memory indeed plays compensatory roles for a range of impairments across all five disorders. Finally, we discuss diagnostic, therapeutic and other implications. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Aphasia; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); Autism; Autism spectrum disorder (ASD); Basal ganglia; Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); Compensation; Declarative memory; Developmental coordination disorder (DCD); Developmental disorders; Dyslexia; Electrophysiology; Event-related potentials (ERPs); Explicit; Explicit memory; Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Habit reversal training; Hippocampus; Language disorder; Medial temporal lobe (MTL); Neurodevelopmental disorders; Neuroimaging; Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); Parkinson's disease (PD); Positron emission tomography (PET); Procedural memory; Sex differences; Specific language impairment (SLI); Specific learning disorder; Striatum; Tourette syndrome; Underdiagnosis","Alexander, A.W., Slinger-Constant, A.-M., Current status of treatments for dyslexia: critical review (2004) J.

A convenient sample of grades 3, 5, and 8 students (n= 1153) was recruited from six elementary and one junior high schools. They were assessed during the beginning and the end of the spring semester of 2013. Internet addiction was examined by the Chen Internet Addiction Scale (CIAS). Other factors were screened using the Chinese version of the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) for autistic trait, the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) for parenting, the Family APGAR for family support, the Social Adjustment Inventory for Children and Adolescents for social function, and the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham, version IV scale (SNAP-IV) for ADHD symptoms. The prevalence of Internet addiction decreased from 11.4% to 10.6%. Male, low family support, poor social adjustment, and high ADHD-related symptoms were related to Internet addiction. However, there was an inverse relationship between autistic traits and Internet addiction. Further, its predictivity could be accounted by poor academic performance, male, and protective parenting style. Internet addiction is not uncommon among youths in Taiwan. The predictors identified in this study could be the specific measures for the development of a prevention program for Internet addiction in the youth population. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder;

We review existing research related to the neural basis of three key neural systems underlying social information processing: social perception, action observation, and theory of mind. We propose an integrative model that unites these three processes and highlights the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), which plays a central role in all three systems. Furthermore, we integrate these neural systems with the dual system account of implicit and explicit social information processing. Large-scale meta-analyses based on Neurosynth confirmed that the pSTS is at the intersection of the three neural systems. Resting-state functional connectivity analysis with 1000 subjects confirmed that the pSTS is connected to all other regions in these systems. The findings presented in this review are specifically relevant for psychiatric research especially disorders characterized by social deficits such as autism spectrum disorder. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Action observation; Autism spectrum disorder; Functional connectivity; Imitation; Mentalizing; Mirror system; Neural systems; Posterior superior temporal sulcus; Psychiatric disorders; Social information processing; Social neuroscience; Social perception; Theory of mind","Adolphs, R., Fear, faces, and the human amygdala (2008) Curr.

Recent studies indicate that these genes are not randomly distributed but cluster into functionally connected biological pathways. We review the recent literature on genome-wide common and rare variants that implicate biological pathways for five major psychiatric disorders. For schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD), there is converging evidence from multiple studies that implicate similar biological pathways, while for other psychiatric disorders converging evidence is lacking. We conclude that larger datasets as well as improved definition of pathways are required to enable the replicable identification of biological pathways underlying psychiatric disorders, which will be crucial in defining novel targets for future pharmaceutical interventions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Eaton, W.W., Martins, S.S., Nestadt, G., Bienvenu, O.J., Clarke, D., Alexandre, P., The burden of mental disorders (2008) Epidemiol Rev, 30, pp. 1-14; Buka, S.L., Psychiatric epidemiology: reducing the global burden of mental illness (2008) Am J Epidemiol, 168, pp. 977-979; Hettema, J.M., Neale, M.C., Kendler, K.S., A review and meta-analysis of the genetic epidemiology of anxiety disorders (2001) Am J Psychiatry, 158, pp. 1568-1578; Sullivan, P.F., Kendler, K.S., Neale, M.C., Schizophrenia as a complex trait: evidence from a meta-analysis of twin studies (2003) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 60, pp. 1187-1192; Lichtenstein, P., Yip, B.H., Björk, C., Pawitan, Y., Cannon, T.D., Sullivan, P.F., Hultman, C.M., Common genetic determinants of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in Swedish families: a population-based study (2009) Lancet, 373, pp. 234-239; Hallmayer, J., Cleveland, S., Torres, A., Phillips, J., Cohen, B., Torigoe, T., Miller, J., Smith, K., Genetic heritability and shared environmental factors among twin pairs with autism (2011) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 68, pp. 1095-1102; Lee, S.H., Ripke, S., Neale, B.M., Faraone, S.V., Purcell, S.M., Perlis, R.H., Mowry, B.J., Witte, J.S., Genetic relationship between five psychiatric disorders estimated from genome-wide SNPs (2013) Nat Genet, 45, pp. 984-994; Sullivan, P.F., Daly, M.J., O'Donovan, M., Genetic architectures of psychiatric disorders: the emerging picture and its implications (2012) Nat Rev Genet, 13, pp. 537-551; Akil, H., Brenner, S., Kandel, E., Kendler, K.S., King, M.-C., Scolnick, E., Watson, J.D., Zoghbi, H.Y., Medicine.

Previous research indicates that exposure to socio-economic disadvantage contributes towards this disparity but that additional factors (including parenting practices) may be involved in mediating/moderating pathways. This study examined duration of breastfeeding amongst children with and without intellectual disability by a secondary analysis of data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study. Children with intellectual disability were significantly less likely to have been ever breastfed; breastfed exclusively or at all at 3 months or breastfed at all at 6 months relative to children without intellectual disability. None of these differences remained significant when other psycho-social risk factors for reduced breastfeeding were controlled for. The study adds to both the sparse literature on breastfeeding practices amongst families of children with intellectual disability and research demonstrating relationships between socio-economic disadvantage and wellbeing for children with intellectual disability. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Breastfeeding; Intellectual disability; Socio-economic","Anderson, L.L., Humphries, K., McDermott, S., Marks, B., Sisarak, J., Larson, S., The state of the science of health and wellness for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (2013) Intellectual & Developmental Disabilities, 51, pp. 385-398; Aumonier, M.E., Cunningham, C.C., Breast feeding in infants with Down's syndrome (1983) Child: Care, Health and Development, 9, pp. 247-255; Bracken, B.A., (2002) Bracken school readiness assessment, , Harcourt Assessment, London; Burd, L., Fisher, W., Kerbeshian, J., Veslely, B., Durgin, B., Reep, P., A comparison of breastfeeding rates among children with pervasive developmental disorder and controls (1988) Journal of Developmental and Behavioural Paediatrics, 9, pp. 247-251; Chapman, D., Scott, K., Stanton-Chapman, T., Public health approach to the study of mental retardation (2008) American Journal of Mental Retardation, 113 (2), pp. 102-116; Conger, R.D., Donnellan, M.B., An interactionist perspective on the socioeconomic context of human development (2007) Annual Review of Psychology, 58, pp. 175-199; Dennis, C.L., McQueen, K., The relationship between infant-feeding outcomes and postpartum depression: A qualitative systematic review (2009) Paediatrics, 123, pp. 736-751; (2008) Bullying involving children with special educational needs and disabilities, , Department for Children Schools and Families, London; (2010) Children with special educational needs 2010: An analysis, , Department for Education, London; (2013) GCSE and equivalent attainment by pupil characteristics in England, 2012/13, , Department for Education, London; Dyson, L., Renfrew, M., McFadden, A., McCormick, F., Herbert, G., Thomas, J., (2006) Promotion of breastfeeding initiation and duration: Evidence into practice briefing, , National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, London; Elliott, C., Smith, P., McCulloch, K., (1997) British ability scales, , nferNelson, London; Emerson, E., Household deprivation, neighbourhood deprivation, ethnicity and the prevalence of intellectual and developmental disabilities (2012) Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, 66, pp. 218-224; Emerson, E., Understanding disabled childhoods: What can we learn from population-based studies?

Without this inherent microbial community, we would be unable to digest plant polysaccharides and would have trouble extracting lipids from our diet. Resident gut bacteria are an important contributor to healthy metabolism and there is significant evidence linking gut microbiota and metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. In the past few years, neuroscience research has demonstrated the importance of microbiota in the development of brain systems that are vital to both stress reactivity and stress-related behaviours.

Recent studies applying new genomic technology to large samples have yielded substantial advances in identifying specific, associated DNA variants as well as clarifying the underlying genetic architecture of the disorder. The genetic liability of schizophrenia is now established as polygenic, with risk alleles in many genes existing across the full allelic frequency spectrum. It has also become apparent that schizophrenia shares risk alleles with other neuropsychiatric phenotypes, such as bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. These risk variants aggregate in several sets of functionally related genes, thereby providing novel insights into disease pathogenesis and opportunities for research into discovering new treatments. © 2014 The Authors.",,"Gottesman, I.I., (1991) Schizophrenia Genesis: The Origins of Madness, , Henry Holt & Company Inc New York;

Despite accumulating knowledge about the cortical circuitry of empathy, almost nothing is known about the connectivity that may be concerned in conveying empathy-related neural information. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we studied dispositional empathy in a large-sized cohort of 107 patients who had undergone surgery for a diffuse low-grade glioma. The self-report questionnaire used enabled us to obtain a global measure of subjective empathy but also, importantly, to assess the two main components of empathy (cognitive and emotional). Data were processed by combining voxelwise and tractwise lesion-symptom analyses. Several major findings emerged from our analyses. First of all, topological voxelwise analyses were inconclusive. Conversely, tractwise multiple regression analyses, including all major associative white matter pathways as potential predictors, yielded to significant models explaining substantial part of the behavioural variance. Among the main results, we found that disconnection of the left cingulum bundle was a strong predictor of a low cognitive empathy (p<0.0005 Bonferroni-corrected). Similarly, we found that disconnection of the right uncinate fasciculus and the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus predicted, respectively, a low (p<0.05 Bonferroni-corrected) and a high (p<0.05 Bonferroni-corrected) subjective empathy. Finally, although we failed to relate emotional empathy to disruption of a specific tract, correlation analyses indicated a positive association between this component of empathy and the volumes of residual lesion infiltration in the right hemisphere (p<0.01). Taken as a whole, these findings provide key fundamental insights into the anatomical connectivity of empathy. They may help to better understand the pathophysiology of empathy impairments in pathological conditions characterized by abnormalities of long-range anatomical connectivity, such as autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia and fronto-temporal dementia. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cingulum; Empathy; Inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus; Low-grade glioma; Social cognition; Uncinate fasciculus","Almairac, F., Herbet, G., Moritz-Gasser, S., de Champfleur, N.M., Duffau, H., The left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus subserves language semantics: a multilevel lesion study (2014) Brain Struct.

Simulation is potentially used not only for inferring how others feel, but also for predicting how we ourselves will feel in the future. For instance, one might judge the worth of a future reward by simulating how much it will eventually be enjoyed. In intertemporal choices between smaller immediate and larger delayed rewards, it is observed that as the length of delay increases, delayed rewards lose subjective value; a phenomenon known as temporal discounting. In this article, we develop a theoretical framework for the proposition that simulation mechanisms involved in empathizing with others also underlie intertemporal choices. This framework yields a testable psychological account of temporal discounting based on simulation. Such an account, if experimentally validated, could have important implications for how simulation mechanisms are investigated, and makes predictions about special populations characterized by putative deficits in simulating others. © 2015 O'Connell, Christakou and Chakrabarti.","Autism; Empathy; Intertemporal choice; Reward; Simulation; Temporal discounting","Addis, D.R., Schacter, D.L., The hippocampus and imagining the future: where do we stand?

We used combined EEG and fMRI in 13 subjects with autism and 13 control participants and show that in autism, gamma and theta cortical activity do not engage synergistically in response to speech. Theta activity in left auditory cortex fails to track speech modulations, and to downregulate gamma oscillations in the group with autism. This deficit predicts the severity of both verbal impairment and autism symptoms in the affected sample. Finally, we found that oscillation-based connectivity between auditory and other language cortices is altered in autism. These results suggest that the verbal disorder in autism could be associated with an altered balance of slow and fast auditory oscillations, and that this anomaly could compromise the mapping between sensory input and higher-level cognitive representations. © 2015 Jochaut, Lehongre, Saitovitch, Devauchelle, Olasagasti, Chabane, Zilbovicius and Giraud.","Auditory cortex; Autism; Cortical oscillations; Oscillation coupling; Speech processing","Abrams, D.A., Lynch, C.J., Cheng, K.M., Phillips, J., Supekar, K., Ryali, S., Underconnectivity between voice-selective cortex and reward circuitry in children with autism (2013) Proc.

Method: Participants included 86 toddlers (range 22-36 months) with ASD and their primary caregiver. Caregiver-child dyads were randomized to receive 10 weeks of hands-on parent training in a naturalistic, developmental behavioral intervention (joint attention, symbolic play, engagement and regulation-JASPER) or a parent-only psychoeducational intervention (PEI). Dose was controlled in terms of researcher-parent contact and early intervention services received by the child. Results: Results yielded significant effects of the JASPER intervention on the primary outcome of joint engagement. The treatment effect was large (Cohen's f2 = .69) and maintained over the 6-month follow-up. JASPER effects were also found on secondary outcomes of play diversity, highest play level achieved, and generalization to the child's classroom for child-initiated joint engagement. The PEI intervention was found to be effective in reducing parenting stress associated with child characteristics. All secondary effects were generally small to moderate. Conclusions: These data highlight the benefit of a brief, targeted, parent-mediated intervention on child outcomes. Future studies may consider the combination of JASPER and PEI treatments for optimal parent and child outcomes. Trial registry no. NCT00999778.

Most research on physical self-processing in autism uses visual stimuli. However, the self is a multimodal construct, and therefore, it is essential to test self-recognition in other sensory modalities as well. Self-recognition in the auditory modality remains relatively unexplored and has not been tested in relation to autism and related traits. This study investigates self-recognition in auditory and visual domain in the general population and tests if it is associated with autistic traits. Methods: Thirty-nine neurotypical adults participated in a two-part study. In the first session, individual participant's voice was recorded and face was photographed and morphed respectively with voices and faces from unfamiliar identities. In the second session, participants performed a 'self-identification' task, classifying each morph as 'self' voice (or face) or an 'other' voice (or face). All participants also completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). For each sensory modality, slope of the self-recognition curve was used as individual self-recognition metric. These two self-recognition metrics were tested for association between each other, and with autistic traits. Results: Fifty percent 'self' response was reached for a higher percentage of self in the auditory domain compared to the visual domain (t∈=∈3.142; P∈<∈0.01). No significant correlation was noted between self-recognition bias across sensory modalities (τ = -0.165, P∈=∈0.204). Higher recognition bias for self-voice was observed in individuals higher in autistic traits (τ <inf>AQ</inf> = 0.301, P = 0.008). No such correlation was observed between recognition bias for self-face and autistic traits (τ <inf>AQ</inf> = -0.020, P = 0.438). Conclusions: Our data shows that recognition bias for physical self-representation is not related across sensory modalities. Further, individuals with higher autistic traits were better able to discriminate self from other voices, but this relation was not observed with self-face. A narrow self-other overlap in the auditory domain seen in individuals with high autistic traits could arise due to enhanced perceptual processing of auditory stimuli often observed in individuals with autism. © 2015 Chakraborty and Chakrabarti; licensee BioMed Central.","Autism; Self-face; Self-recognition; Self-voice","James, W., (1890) The Principles of Psychology.

We performed a meta-analysis using new publicly available Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets of autism. We performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses and pathway analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Ten GEO datasets, including 364 cases and 248 controls, were available for the meta-analysis. We identified 3105 genes that were consistently DE in autism (1425 upregulated and 1680 downregulated genes). We also found that 7 genes were associated with phospholipase A2 (PLA2), including LYPLA2P1, PLA2G4D, PNPLA2, LYPLA2, PLA2G6, PLA2G7, and PLA2G5. We found GO terms for molecular functions significantly enriched in structural constituent of ribosome (GO: 0003735, P = 1.87-E06) and transcription regulator activity (GO: 0030528, P = 8.86E-04), while for biological processes, the enriched GO terms were involved in translational elongation (GO: 0006414, P = 1.74E-12) and the response to cytokine stimuli (GO: 0034097, P = 2.76E-05). The most significant pathway in our KEGG analysis was the ribosome pathway (P = 7.90E-12). Our meta-analysis identified genes that were consistently DE and biological pathways associated with gene expression changes in autism. © FUNPEC-RP.","Autism; Differentially expressed genes; Expression data; Meta-analysis; Microarray","Alter, M.D., Kharkar, R., Ramsey, K.E., Craig, D.W., Autism and increased paternal age related changes in global levels of gene expression regulation (2011) Plos One, 6; Ashwood, P., Wills, S., Van De Waer, J., The immune response in autism: A new frontier for autism research (2006) J.

Dressed up as moon goddesses, mad scientists, and other fantastical characters, they act out elaborate, improvised narratives of transformation, destruction, and redemption. For several summers, this group, who I call the Journeyfolk, ran a camp for teenagers on the autism spectrum, engaging campers in therapeutic reconfigurations of self and social role. Through this folk healing practice, the meaning of autism was itself transformed; what had been a source of isolation became a source of commonality and community. This paper takes the camp as a case study for examining the co-productive relationship between culture and neurodiversity. Cognitive tendencies often found in autism are often thought to preclude socio-cultural participation. However, such tendencies can also facilitate the co-creation of innovative cultural spaces, through processes of affinity and affiliation. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork at the camp, I identify three sites of congruity between the culture of the camp and the cognitive and phenomenological experiences associated with autism, at which this “work of culture” (Obeysekere in The Work of Culture: Symbolic Transformation in Psychoanalysis and Anthropology, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1990) took place: the structure of social interactions within roleplaying games, the narratives enacted within these games, and the interpersonal relationships within which the games were embedded. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Asperger’s syndrome; Autism; LARP; Neurodiversity",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925589704

Although a number of highly penetrant ASD gene variants have been identified, there is growing evidence to support a causal role for combinatorial effects arising from the contributions of multiple loci. By examining synaptic and circadian neurological phenotypes resulting from the dosage variants of unique human:fly orthologues in Drosophila, we observe numerous synergistic interactions between pairs of informatically-identified candidate genes whose orthologues are jointly affected by large de novo copy number variants (CNVs). These CNVs were found in the genomes of individuals with autism, including a patient carrying a 22q11.2 deletion. We first demonstrate that dosage alterations of the unique Drosophila orthologues of candidate genes from de novo CNVs that harbour only a single candidate gene display neurological defects similar to those previously reported in Drosophila models of ASD-associated variants. We then considered pairwise dosage changes within the set of orthologues of candidate genes that were affected by the same single human de novo CNV. For three of four CNVs with complete orthologous relationships, we observed significant synergistic effects following the simultaneous dosage change of gene pairs drawn from a single CNV. The phenotypic variation observed at the Drosophila synapse that results from these interacting genetic variants supports a concordant phenotypic outcome across all interacting gene pairs following the direction of human gene copy number change. We observe both specificity and transitivity between interactors, both within and between CNV candidate gene sets, supporting shared and distinct genetic aetiologies. We then show that different interactions affect divergent synaptic processes, demonstrating distinct molecular aetiologies. Our study illustrates mechanisms through which synergistic effects resulting from large structural variation can contribute to human disease. © 2015 Grice et al.",,"Veenstra-Vanderweele, J., Christian, S.L., Cook, E.H., Jr., Autism as a paradigmatic complex genetic disorder (2004) Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet, 5, pp. 379-405;

Biomarkers for ASD offer the opportunity to improve prediction, diagnosis, stratification by severity and subtype, monitoring over time and in response to interventions, and overall understanding of the underlying biology of this disorder. A variety of potential biomarkers, from the level of genes and proteins to network-level interactions, is currently being examined. Many of these biomarkers relate to inhibition, which is of particular interest because in many cases ASD is thought to be a disorder of imbalance between excitation and inhibition. Abnormalities in inhibition at the cellular level lead to emergent properties in networks of neurons. These properties take into account a more complete genetic and cellular background than findings at the level of individual genes or cells, and are able to be measured in live humans, offering additional potential as diagnostic biomarkers and predictors of behaviors. In this review we provide examples of how altered inhibition may inform the search for ASD biomarkers at multiple levels, from genes to cells to networks. © 2015 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD); Biomarkers; GABA; Inhibition; Interneurons; Networks",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925625065

Mothers' own generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and their ratings of their sons' GAD were compared with the boys' self-ratings and the ratings of the boys given by a clinician. Boys' cortisol concentrations were also explored for their association with these three sources of GAD ratings. Results indicated that mothers' GAD was significantly and directly correlated with the ratings they gave for their sons' but that only mothers who were above-minimally anxious gave ratings of their sons' anxiety that significantly agreed with those from the clinicians. Minimally-anxious mothers appeared to underestimate their sons' anxiety, and these effects generalised to their sons' self-ratings of anxiety.

Indeed, this array of deficits is sufficiently prominent to have prompted a theory that executive dysfunction is at the heart of these disorders. A more detailed examination of these behaviors reveals, however, that some aspects of executive function remain developmentaly appropriate. In particular, while people with autism often have difficulty with tasks requiring cognitive flexibility, their fundamental cognitive control capabilities, such as those involved in inhibiting an inappropriate but relatively automatic response, show no significant impairment on many tasks. In this article, an existing computational model of the prefrontal cortex and its role in executive control is shown to explain this dichotomous pattern of behavior by positing abnormalities in the dopamine-based modulation of frontal systems in individuals with autism. This model offers excellent qualitative and quantitative fits to performance on standard tests of cognitive control and cognitive flexibility in this clinical population. By simulating the development of the prefrontal cortex, the computational model also offers a potential explanation for an observed lack of executive dysfunction early in life. © 2015 Kriete, Noelle.",,"Ozonoff, S., Pennington, B.F., Rogers, S.J., Executive function deficits in high-functioning autistic individuals: Relationship to theory of mind (1991) Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines, 32, pp. 1081-1105;

While these alterations are starting to be well characterized in subjects where the clinical picture is fully expressed, less is known on their earlier developmental course. In the present study we systematically reviewed current knowledge on structural connectivity in ASD infants and toddlers. We searched PubMed and Medline databases for all English language papers, published from year 2000, exploring structural connectivity in populations of infants and toddlers whose mean age was below 30 months. Of the 264 papers extracted, four were found to be eligible and were reviewed. Three of the four selected studies reported higher fractional anisotropy values in subjects with ASD compared to controls within commissural fibers, projections fibers, and association fibers, suggesting brain hyper-connectivity in the earliest phases of the disorder. Similar conclusions emerged from the other diffusion parameters assessed. These findings are reversed to what is generally found in studies exploring older patient groups and suggest a developmental course characterized by a shift toward hypo-connectivity starting at a time between two and four years of age. © 2015 Conti, Calderoni, Marchi, Muratori, Cioni and Guzzetta.","Autism; Diffusion MRI; Hyperconnectivity; Neurodevelopment; Structural connectivity; Toddlers","(2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , 5th Edn.

Genome-wide microarrays reveal cryptic genomic imbalances, related or not to the breakpoints, in 25% to 50% of patients with an abnormal phenotype carrying a microscopically balanced chromosomal rearrangement. Here we performed microarray analysis of 18 patients with ASD carrying balanced chromosomal abnormalities to identify submicroscopic imbalances implicated in abnormal neurodevelopment. Methods: Eighteen patients with ASD carrying apparently balanced chromosomal abnormalities were screened using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Nine rearrangements were de novo, seven inherited, and two of unknown inheritance. Genomic imbalances were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative PCR. Results: We detected clinically significant de novo copy number variants in four patients (22%), including three with de novo rearrangements and one with an inherited abnormality. The sizes ranged from 3.3 to 4.9 Mb; three were related to the breakpoint regions and one occurred elsewhere. We report a patient with a duplication of the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome critical region, contributing to the delineation of this rare genomic disorder. The patient has a chromosome 4p inverted duplication deletion, with a 0.5 Mb deletion of terminal 4p and a 4.2 Mb duplication of 4p16.2p16.3. The other cases included an apparently balanced de novo translocation t(5;18)(q12;p11.2) with a 4.2 Mb deletion at the 18p breakpoint, a subject with de novo pericentric inversion inv(11)(p14q23.2) in whom the array revealed a de novo 4.9 Mb deletion in 7q21.3q22.1, and a patient with a maternal inv(2)(q14.2q37.3) with a de novo 3.3 Mb terminal 2q deletion and a 4.2 Mb duplication at the proximal breakpoint. In addition, we identified a rare de novo deletion of unknown significance on a chromosome unrelated to the initial rearrangement, disrupting a single gene, RFX3. Conclusions: These findings underscore the utility of SNP arrays for investigating apparently balanced chromosomal abnormalities in subjects with ASD or related neurodevelopmental disorders in both clinical and research settings. © 2015 Tabet et al.;

A total of 41 children and adolescents aged 7–18 years (36 boys, 5 girls; mean age=11.66, s.d.=3.05) diagnosed with ASD participated in the study. At post-treatment, participants showed significant improvements on all subscales of the Social Responsiveness Scale (P<0.01) and the Social and Attention Problems syndrome scales of the Child Behavior Checklist (P<0.05). Blood fatty acid levels were significantly correlated with changes in the core symptoms of ASD. Baseline levels of blood fatty acid levels were also predictive of response to the omega-3 treatment. Omega-3 fatty acids supplementation was well-tolerated and did not cause any serious side effects. Our findings lend some preliminary support for the use of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation in addressing ASD. Future randomized controlled trials of omega-3 fatty acids in ASD with blood fatty acid measurements with a larger sample and longer follow-up period is warranted.European Journal of Clinical Nutrition advance online publication, 25 March 2015; doi:10.1038/ejcn.2015.28. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925662800

This exploratory study aimed to examine the change across time in young children with autism and their mothers, who received less intensive early interventions with and without applied behavior analysis (ABA) methods in community settings in Japan. Methods: Eighteen children with autism (mean age: 45.7 months; range: 28-64 months) received ABA-based treatment (a median of 3.5 hours per week; an interquartile range of 2-5.6 hours per week) and/or eclectic treatment-as-usual (TAU) (a median of 3.1 hours per week; an interquartile range of 2-5.6 hours per week). Children's outcomes were the severity of autistic symptoms, cognitive functioning, internalizing and externalizing behavior after 6 months (a median of 192 days; an interquartile range of 178-206 days). In addition, maternal parenting stress at 6-month follow-up, and maternal depression at 1.5-year follow-up (a median of 512 days; an interquartile range of 358-545 days) were also examined. Results: Large individual variations were observed for a broad range of children's and mothers' outcomes. Neither ABA nor TAU hours per week were significantly associated with an improvement in core autistic symptoms. A significant improvement was observed only for internalizing problems, irrespective of the type, intensity or monthly cost of treatment received. Higher ABA cost per month (a median of 1,188 USD; an interquartile range of 538-1,888 USD) was associated with less improvement in language-social DQ (a median of 9; an interquartile range of -6.75-23.75). Conclusions: To determine an optimal program for each child with ASD in areas with poor ASD resources, further controlled studies are needed that assess a broad range of predictive and outcome variables focusing on both individual characteristics and treatment components. © 2015 Kamio et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Applied behavior analysis; Autism spectrum disorders; Early intervention; Low intensity; Outcome",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928978621

Here we investigated the neurophysiological correlates of conditions of increasing social scene complexity using 3D human models as targets of attention, which may also be important in autism research. Challenging single-trial statistical classification of EEG neural signals was attempted for detection of oddball stimuli with increasing social scene complexity. Stimuli had an oddball structure and were as follows: 1) flashed schematic eyes, 2) simple 3D faces flashed between averted and non-averted gaze (only eye position changing), 3) simple 3D faces flashed between averted and non-averted gaze (head and eye position changing), 4) animated avatar alternated its gaze direction to the left and to the right (head and eye position), 5) environment with 4 animated avatars all of which change gaze and one of which is the target of attention. We found a late (> 300 ms) neurophysiological oddball correlate for all conditions irrespective of their complexity as assessed by repeated measures ANOVA. We attempted single-trial detection of this signal with automatic classifiers and obtained a significant balanced accuracy classification of around 79%, which is noteworthy given the amount of scene complexity. Lateralization analysis showed a specific right lateralization only for more complex realistic social scenes. In sum, complex ecological animations with social content elicit neurophysiological events which can be characterized even at the single-trial level. These signals are right lateralized. These finding paves the way for neuroscientific studies in affective neuroscience based on complex social scenes, and given the detectability at the single trial level this suggests the feasibility of brain computer interfaces that can be applied to social cognition disorders such as autism. © 2015 Amaral et al.",,"Kaspar, K., What Guides Visual Overt Attention under Natural Conditions?

Emerging evidence supported the hypothesis that these neurodevelopmental disorders may result from a combination of genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental toxins in early developmental phases. This study assessed the effects of prenatal exposure to chlorpyrifos (CPF), a widely diffused organophosphate insecticide endowed with developmental neurotoxicity at sub-toxic doses, in the BTBR T+tf/J mouse strain, a validated model of idiopathic autism that displays several behavioral traits relevant to the autism spectrum. To this aim, pregnant BTBR mice were administered from gestational day 14 to 17 with either vehicle or CPF at a dose of 6 mg/kg/bw by oral gavages. Offspring of both sexes underwent assessment of early developmental milestones, including somatic growth, motor behavior and ultrasound vocalization. To evaluate the potential longterm effects of CPF, two different social behavior patterns typically altered in the BTBR strain (free social interaction with a same-sex companion in females, or interaction with a sexually receptive female in males) were also examined in the two sexes at adulthood. Our findings indicate significant effects of CPF on somatic growth and neonatal motor patterns. CPF treated pups showed reduced weight gain, delayed motor maturation (i.e., persistency of immature patterns such as pivoting at the expenses of coordinated locomotion) and a trend to enhanced ultrasound vocalization. At adulthood, CPF associated alterations were found in males only: the altered pattern of investigation of a sexual partner, previously described in BTBR mice, was enhanced in CPF males, and associated to increased ultrasonic vocalization rate. These findings strengthen the need of future studies to evaluate the role of environmental chemicals in the etiology of neurodevelopment disorders. © 2015 De Felice et al.",,"Abrahams, B.S., Geschwind, D.H., Advances in autism genetics: On the threshold of a new neurobiology (2008) Nat Rev Genet., 9 (5), pp. 341-355. , 18414403;

Affective visual stimuli were used to assess autonomic reactivity and emotion identification, and the social responsiveness scale was used to determine the level social functioning in children with WS and ASD contrasted with typical development (TD), to examine syndrome-specific and syndrome-general features. Children with ASD exhibited the highest arousal in response to faces, with a lack of difference in autonomic sensitivity across different emotional expressions, unlike in WS and TD. The WS group demonstrated unique deficits in identifying neutral stimuli. While autonomic responsivity to neutral faces was associated with social functioning in all children, converging profiles characterized children with WS contrasted with TD and ASD. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Autism spectrum disorder; Autonomic nervous system; Emotion; Social behavior; Social functioning; Williams syndrome",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925423199

Although reduction of phase-locked gamma oscillation has been suggested to be a result of reduced parvalbumin-immunoreactive (putatively, GABAergic) neurons, no direct correlations between these have been established in these disorders. In the present study, we investigated such relationships during pharmacological treatment with a newly synthesized drug, T-817MA, which displays neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects. In this study, we used platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β gene knockout (PDGFR-β KO) mice as an animal model of schizophrenia and autism. These mutant mice display a reduction in social behaviors; deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI); reduced levels of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons in the medical prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and superior colliculus; and a deficit in of auditory phase-locked gamma oscillations. We found that oral administration of T-817MA ameliorated all these symptoms in the PDGFR-β KO mice. Furthermore, phase-locked gamma oscillations were significantly correlated with the density of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons, which was, in turn, correlated with PPI and behavioral parameters. These findings suggest that recovery of parvalbuminimmunoreactive neurons by pharmacological intervention relieved the reduction of phase-locked gamma oscillations and, consequently, ameliorated PPI and social behavioral deficits. Thus, our findings suggest that phase-locked gamma oscillations could be a useful physiological biomarker for abnormality of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons that may induce cognitive deficits and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and autism, as well as of effective pharmacological interventions in both humans and experimental animals. © 2015 Nakamura et al.",,"Gandal, M.J., Edgar, J.C., Klook, K., Siegel, S.J., Gamma synchrony: Towards a translational biomarker for the treatment-resistant symptoms of schizophrenia (2012) Neuropharmacology, 62, pp. 1504-1518. , 21349276; Orekhova, E.V., Stroganova, T.A., Prokofyev, A.O., Nygren, G., Gillberg, C., Elam, M., Sensory gating in young children with autism: Relation to age, IQ, and EEG gamma oscillations (2008) Neuroscience Letters, 434, pp. 218-223. , 18313850; Sohal, V.S., Zhang, Yizhar, O., Deisseroth, K., Parvalbumin neurons and gamma rhythms enhance cortical circuit performance (2009) Nature, 459, pp. 698-702. , 19396159; Tamás, G., Buhl, E.H., Lörincz, A., Somogyi, P., Proximally targeted GABAergic synapses and gap junctions synchronize cortical interneurons (2000) Nat Neurosci., 3, pp. 366-371. , 10725926; Beasley, C.L., Gavin, P., Reynolds, G.P., Parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons are reduced in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenics (1997) Schizophrenia Research, 24, pp. 349-355. , 9134596; Lawrence, Y.A., Kemper, T.L., Bauman, M.L., Blatt, G.J., Parvalbumin-, calbindin-, and calretinin-immunoreactive hippocampal interneuron density in autism (2010) Acta Neurol Scand., 121, pp. 99-108. , 19719810; Gogolla, N., LeBlanc, J.J., Quast, K.B., Sudhof, T.C., Fagiolini, M., Hensch, T.K., Common circuit defect of excitatoryinhibitory balance in mouse models of autism (2009) Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders., 1, pp. 172-181. , 20664807; Nestler, E.J., Hyman, S.E., Animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Variation in autistic traits has been linked to reduced functional and structural connectivity (i.e., underconnectivity, or reduced synchrony) with neural networks modulated by attentional, social, and affective functions. Yet, it remains unclear whether reduced synchrony between these neural networks contributes to autistic traits. To investigate this issue, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to record brain activation while neurotypical participants who varied in their subclinical scores on the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) viewed alternating blocks of social and nonsocial stimuli (i.e., images of faces and of landscape scenes). We used independent component analysis (ICA) combined with a spatiotemporal regression to quantify synchrony between neural networks. Our results indicated that decreased synchrony between the executive control network (ECN) and a face-scene network (FSN) predicted higher scores on the AQ. This relationship was not explained by individual differences in head motion, preferences for faces, or personality variables related to social cognition. Our findings build on clinical reports by demonstrating that reduced synchrony between distinct neural networks contributes to a range of subclinical autistic traits. © 2015 Young, Smith, Coutlee and Huettel.","Autism quotient; Dual regression; Executive control network; Face processing; Functional connectivity; Independent component analysis","Adolphs, R., Conceptual challenges and directions for social neuroscience (2010) Neuron, 65, pp. 752-767; Alaerts, K., Woolley, D.G., Steyaert, J., Di Martino, A., Swinnen, S.P., Wenderoth, N., Underconnectivity of the superior temporal sulcus predicts emotion recognition deficits in autism (2014) Soc.

Thus, we developed an online training to improve knowledge and decrease stigma associated with autism among college students. Participants (N = 365) completed a pre-test, online training, and post-test. Women reported lower stigma towards autism than men. Participation in the training was associated with decreased stigma and increased knowledge about autism. Although participants exhibited relatively high baseline knowledge of autism, misconceptions were common, particularly in open-ended responses. Participants commonly confused autism with other disorders, such as learning disabilities.

The byproducts of harmful gut bacteria can interfere with brain development and may contribute to autism. Strategies to improve the gut microflora profile through dietary modification may help to alleviate gut disorders in autistic patients. Method: Sixty young male western albino rats were divided into six equal groups. The first group served as the control; the second group was given an oral neurotoxic dose of propionic (PPA) (250 mg/kg body weight/day) for three days. The third group received an orogastric dose of ampicillin (50 mg/kg for three weeks) with a standard diet. Groups 4, 5 and 6 were given an orogastric dose of ampicillin and fed high-carbohydrate, high-protein and high-lipid diets, respectively, for 10 weeks. Biochemical parameters related to oxidative stress were investigated in brain homogenates from each group. Result: The microbiology results revealed descriptive changes in the fecal microbiota of rats treated with ampicillin either alone or with the three dietary regimens. The results of PPA acid and ampicillin treatment showed significant increases in lipid peroxidation and catalase with decreases in glutathione and potassium compared with levels in the control group. A protein-rich diet was effective at restoring the glutathione level, while the carbohydrate-rich diet recovered lipid peroxidation and catalase activity. In addition, the three dietary regimens significantly increase the potassium level in the brain tissue of the test animals. Lactate dehydrogenase was remarkably elevated in all groups relative to the control. No outstanding effects were observed in glutathione S-transferase and creatine kinase. Conclusion: The changes observed in the measured parameters reflect the neurotoxic effects of PPA and ampicillin. Lipid peroxide and catalase activity and the levels of glutathione and potassium are satisfactory biomarkers of PPA and ampicillin neurotoxicity. Based on the effects of the three dietary regimens, a balanced diet can protect against PPA or ampicillin-induced neurotoxicity that might induce autistic traits. These outcomes will help efforts directed at controlling the prevalence of autism, a disorder that has recently been associated with PPA neurotoxicity. © 2015 El-Ansary et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Ampicillin; Autism; Dietary regimens; Gut microbiota; Neurotoxicity; Propionic acid","Sommer, F., Bäckhed, F., The gut microbiota - Masters of host development and physiology (2013) Nat Rev Microbiol, 11, pp. 227-238. , 23435359; Montiel-Castro Aj, G., Pacheco-LópezG: Themicrobiota-gut-brain axis: Neurobehavioral correlates, health and sociality Front (2013) Integr.

The list of autism-related genes has significantly increased due to better awareness with advances in genetic technology and expanding searchable genomic databases. We compiled a master list of known and clinically relevant autism spectrum disorder genes identified with supporting evidence from peer-reviewed medical literature sources by searching key words related to autism and genetics and from authoritative autism-related public access websites, such as the Simons Foundation Autism Research Institute autism genomic database dedicated to gene discovery and characterization. Our list consists of 792 genes arranged in alphabetical order in tabular form with gene symbols placed on high-resolution human chromosome ideograms, thereby enabling clinical and laboratory geneticists and genetic counsellors to access convenient visual images of the location and distribution of ASD genes. Meaningful correlations of the observed phenotype in patients with suspected/confirmed ASD gene(s) at the chromosome region or breakpoint band site can be made to inform diagnosis and gene-based personalized care and provide genetic counselling for families. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","ASD genes; Autism; Autism spectrum disorders (ASD); Genetic evidence; High-resolution chromosome ideograms","(2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, 4th ed.; American Psychiatric Association: Washington, DC, USA; Johnson, C.P., Myers, S.M., American Academy of Pediatrics Counsel on Children with Disablities (2007) Identifiction and Evaluation of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.

This study examined physical activity as a variable that might influence sleep quality in children with ASD. Ten children, ages 9–16 years, were asked to wear accelerometer devices for 7 days in order to track objective measures of activity and sleep quality. Parents of the children also completed the Child’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire and maintained a daily sleep log while their child wore the device. This study demonstrated that though over half of the children were identified as having at least one sleep-related problem, their activity levels were significantly related to their sleep patterns. Specifically, the more physically active children had overall higher sleep quality. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Accelerometry; Physical activity; Sedentary; Sleep",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925278452

However, a large fraction of these CNVs have not been accurately characterized at the single-base-pair level, thereby hampering a better understanding of the mutational mechanisms underlying CNV formation. Here, employing a composite pipeline method derived from various inference-based programs, we have characterized 26 deletion CNVs [including three novel pathogenic CNVs involving an autosomal gene (EXT2) causing hereditary osteochondromas and an X-linked gene (CLCN5) causing Dent disease, as well as 23 CNVs previously identified by inference from a cohort of Canadian autism spectrum disorder families] to the single-base-pair level of accuracy from whole-genome sequencing data. We found that breakpoint-flanking micro-mutations (within 22 bp of the breakpoint) are present in a significant fraction (5/26; 19 %) of the deletion CNVs. This analysis also provided evidence that a recently described error-prone form of DNA repair (i.e., repair of DNA double-strand breaks by templated nucleotide sequence insertions derived from distant regions of the genome) not only causes human genetic disease but also impacts on human genome evolution. Our findings illustrate the importance of precise CNV breakpoint delineation for understanding the underlying mutational mechanisms and have implications for primer design in relation to the detection of deletion CNVs in clinical diagnosis. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925265361

These abnormalities could be caused by alterations in the methylation, sulfation, and metalloprotein pathways. This study sought to evaluate the physiological and behavioral effects of children with autism sleeping in an International Organization for Standardization Class 5 cleanroom. Methods: Ten children with autism, ages 3-12, slept in a cleanroom for two weeks to evaluate changes in toxin levels, oxidative stress, immune dysregulation, and behavior. Before and after the children slept in the cleanroom, samples of blood and hair and rating scale scores were obtained to assess these changes. Results: Five children significantly lowered their concentration of oxidized glutathione, a biomarker of oxidative stress. The younger cohort, age 5 and under, showed significantly greater mean decreases in two markers of immune dysregulation, CD3% and CD4%, than the older cohort. Changes in serum magnesium, influencing neuronal regulation, correlated negatively while changes in serum iron, affecting oxygenation of tissues, correlated positively with age. Changes in serum benzene and PCB 28 concentrations showed significant negative correlations with age. The younger children demonstrated significant improvements on behavioral rating scales compared to the older children. In a younger pair of identical twins, one twin showed significantly greater improvements in 4 out of 5 markers of oxidative stress, which corresponded with better overall behavioral rating scale scores than the other twin. Conclusions: Younger children who slept in the cleanroom altered elemental levels, decreased immune dysregulation, and improved behavioral rating scales, suggesting that their detoxification metabolism was briefly enhanced. The older children displayed a worsening in behavioral rating scale performance, which may have been caused by the mobilization of toxins from their tissues. The interpretation of this exploratory study is limited by lack of a control group and small sample size. The changes in physiology and behavior noted suggest that performance of larger, prospective controlled studies of exposure to nighttime or 24 hour cleanroom conditions for longer time periods may be useful for understanding detoxification in children with autism. © Faber et al.","Autism; Behavioral rating scales; Cleanroom; Glutathione; Immune dysregulation; Oxidative stress","Baird, G., Cass, H., Slonims, V., Diagnosis of autism (2003) BMJ, 327, pp. 488-493; Wing, L., Potter, D., The epidemiology of autistic spectrum disorders: is the prevalence rising?

This study compared 7 behavioural domains of 96 behaviours among Chinese children.Method There were 803 children, including 426 children with low-functioning ASD (LFASD), 193 children with high-functioning ASD (HFASD), 128 children with ID, and 56 TD children. Ages ranged from 36 to 84 months. Each individual was administered the Chinese Autism Diagnostic Scale by a group of Chinese professionals.Results All 7 domains were found to be more impaired for the children with ASD than the other groups. Three domains contained the most distinctive behaviours: Play behaviours, Social-Interactive behaviours, and Receptive Language behaviours. The Expressive Language domain was different for the LFASD group versus the group with ID.Conclusion Children with ASD differed from children without ASD by several specific behaviours. These behaviours also differentiated performances by the children with HFASD and LFASD. © 2015 Australasian Society for Intellectual Disability, Inc.","assessment; autism spectrum disorder; behaviours; Chinese; domains; intellectual disability; lower and higher functioning",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925400538

The current study used a diathesis-stress model to investigate stressors (parent distress and negative life events [NLE]) and vulnerabilities (youth age and intellectual functioning) as predictors of depressive symptoms in youth with ASD. Parents of youth with ASD (N = 91; ages 7 to 25 years) completed online questionnaires about demographic variables, distress, NLE, and youth depression. High parent distress and exposure to 3 or more NLE were associated with symptoms of depression in individuals with ASD. Also, youth with ASD who were younger, or who were noted to have average or above-average intellectual functioning, were reported to have higher depression levels than other individuals with ASD. None of the vulnerabilities were found to moderate the relationships between stressors and depression. © 2015, Routledge.

Epithelial cell-derived neutrophil-activating peptide-78 (ENA-78) is a chemokine that recruits and activates neutrophils, thus it could play a pathogenic role in inflammation and autoimmune disorders. Some autistic children have elevated levels of brain specific auto-antibodies. We are the first to evaluate serum expression of ENA-78 and its relation to antineuronal auto-antibodies in autistic children. Methods: Serum ENA-78 and antineuronal auto-antibodies were measured by ELISA test in 62 autistic children aged between 4-11 years and 62 health-matched controls. Results: Serum levels of ENA-78 were significantly higher in autistic children than healthy controls (P < 0.001). Increased serum levels of ENA-78 have been found in 69.35% of autistic patients. In addition, autistic children had significantly higher percent positivity of serum antineuronal auto-antibodies (64.5%) than healthy controls (6.45%), P < 0.001. There was a significant positive association between the positivity of serum antineuronal auto-antibodies and the elevated levels of serum ENA-78 (P < 0.001) in autistic children. Conclusions: Serum levels of ENA-78 were elevated in autistic children and they were significantly associated with the increased levels of serum antineuronal auto-antibodies. However, these data should be treated with caution until further research is conducted to determine the pathogenic role of ENA-78 in autism and its relation to brain specific auto-antibodies that have been found in some autistic children. The possible therapeutic role of ENA-78 antagonist in autistic children should be also studied. © 2015 Mostafa and Al-Ayadhi.","Antineuronal auto-antibodies; Autism; Autoimmunity; Chemokines; Epithelial cell-derived neutrophil-activating peptide-78","Zlotnik, A., Yoshie, O., Chemokines: a new classification system and their role in immunity (2000) Immunity, 12 (2), pp. 121-127; Smit, J.J., Lukacs, N.W., A closer look at chemokines and their role in asthmatic responses (2006) Eur J Pharmacol, 533 (1-3), pp. 277-288; Ono, S.J., Nakamura, T., Miyazaki, D., Ohbayashi, M., Dawson, M., Toda, M., Chemokines: roles in leukocyte development, trafficking and effect or function (2003) J Allergy Clin Immunol, 111, pp. 1185-1199; Sanz, M.J., Kubes, P., Neutrophil-active chemokines in in vivo imaging of neutrophil trafficking (2012) Eur J Immunol, 42, pp. 278-283; Lira, S.A., Furtado, G.C., The biology of chemokines and their receptors (2012) Immunol Res, 54, pp. 111-120; Smith, J.J., Lukacs, N.W., A closer look at chemokines and their role in asthmatic responses (2006) Eur J Pharmacol, 3, pp. 277-288; Bisset, L.R., Schmid-Grendelmeier, P., Chemokines and their receptors in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma: progress and perspective (2005) Curr Opin Pulm Med, 11 (1), pp. 35-42; Minshall, E.M., Cameron, L., Lavigne, F., Leung, D.Y., Hamilos, D., Garcia-Zepada, E.A., Eotaxin mRNA and protein expression in chronic sinusitis and allergen-induced nasal responses in seasonal allergic rhinitis (1997) Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol, 17 (6), pp. 683-690; Nathan, C., Neutrophils and immunity: challenges and opportunities (2006) Nat Rev Immunol, 6, pp. 173-182; Jancar, S., Sanchez, C.M., Immune complex-mediated tissue injury: a multistep paradigm (2005) Trends Immunol, 26, pp. 48-55; Cohly, H.H., Panja, A., Immunological findings in autism (2005) Int Rev Neurobiol, 71, pp. 317-341; Singh, V.K., Warren, R.P., Averett, R., Ghaziuddin, M., Circulating autoantibodies to neuronal and glial filament proteins in autism (1997) Pediatr Neurol, 17, pp. 88-90; Mostafa, G.A., El-Sayed, Z.A., Abd El Aziz, M.M., El-Sayed, M.F., Serum anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein antibodies in Egyptian autistic children (2008) J Child Neurol, 23, pp. 1413-1418; Mostafa, G.A., Al-Ayadhi, L.Y., Increased serum levels of anti-ganglioside M1 auto-antibodies in autistic children: relation to the disease severity (2011) J Neuroinflammation, 8, p. 39; Mostafa, G.A., Al-Ayadhi, L.Y., A lack of association between hyperserotonemia and the increased frequency of serum anti-myelin basic protein auto-antibodies in autistic children (2011) J Neuroinflammation, 8, p. 71; Mostafa, G.A., Al-Ayadhi, L.Y., The possible link between the elevated serum levels of neurokinin A and anti-ribosomal P protein antibodies in children with autism (2011) J Neuroinflammation, 8, p. 180; Mostafa, G.A., Al-Ayadhi, L.Y., The relationship between the increased frequency of serum antineuronal antibodies and the severity of autism in children (2012) Eur J Paediatr Neurol, 16, pp. 464-468; Sweeten, T.L., Bowyer, S.L., Posey, D.J., Halberstadt, G.M., McDougle, C.J., Increased prevalence of familial autoimmunity in probands with pervasive developmental disorders (2003) Pediatrics, 112, pp. 420-424; Mostafa, G.A., Kitchener, N., Serum anti-nuclear antibodies as a marker of autoimmunity in Egyptian autistic children (2009) Pediatr Neurol, 40, pp. 107-112; Mostafa, G.A., Shehab, A., The link of C4B null allele to autism and to a family history of autoimmunity in Egyptian autistic children (2010) J Neuroimmunol, 223, pp. 115-119; Mostafa, G.A., El-Hadidi, E.S., Hewedi, D.H., Abdou, M.M., Oxidative stress in Egyptian children with autism: relation to autoimmunity (2010) J Neuroimmunol, 219, pp. 114-118; Karpus, W.J., Fife, B.T., Kennedy, K.J., Immunoneutralization of chemokines for the prevention and treatment of central nervous system autoimmune disease (2003) Methods, 29, pp. 362-368; Karpus, W.J., Ransohoff, R.M., Chemokine regulation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis: temporal and spatial expression patterns govern disease pathogenesis (1998) J Immunol, 161, pp. 2667-2671; (1994) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , 4th ed.

Thirty mother–child dyads with children ages 3–7 years with a diagnosis of ASD participated in this randomized controlled study. Following manualized CDIT, statistically significant and meaningful improvements in child disruptive behavior and social awareness as well as maternal distress associated with child disruptive behavior occurred. Across 8 sessions, mothers learned to provide positive attention to their children's appropriate social and play behaviors. Both child and parent changes were maintained at 6-week follow-up. A relatively brief, time-limited, and accessible intervention may be efficacious for improving child and parent behaviors in families of young children with ASD. By decreasing child disruptive behaviors, CDIT may also help to prepare children to benefit further from future interventions. 2015 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925268746

Here, we aim to explore the contribution of common PTCHD1 variants in ASD and gain additional evidence for the role of rare variants of this gene in ASD and ID. A two-stage case–control association study investigated 28 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 994 ASD cases and 1035 controls from four European populations. Mutation screening was performed in 673 individuals who included 240 ASD cases, 183 ID patients and 250 controls. The case–control association study showed a significant association with rs7052177 (P=6.13E-4) in the ASD discovery sample that was replicated in an independent sample (P=0.03). A Mantel-Haenszel meta-analysis for rs7052177T considering the four European populations showed an odds ratio of 0.58 (P=7E-05). This SNP is predicted to be located in a transcription factor binding site. No rare missense PTCHD1 variants were found in our ASD cohort and only one was identified in the ID sample. A duplication (27 bp) in the promoter region, absent from 590 controls, was found in three ASD patients (Fisher exact test, P=0.024). A gene reporter assay showed a significant decrease in the transcriptional activity (26%) driven by this variant. Moreover, we found that the longest allele of a trinucleotide repeat located upstream from PTCHD1 was associated with ASD (P=0.003, permP=0.0186). Our results further support the involvement of PTCHD1 in ASD, suggesting that both common and rare variants contribute to the disorder.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 18 March 2015; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2015.37. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925238046

Mutations in the RAB39B gene cause intellectual disability comorbid with autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy, but the impact of RAB39B loss of function on synaptic activity is largely unexplained. Here we show that protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1) is a downstream effector of GTP-bound RAB39B and that RAB39B-PICK1 controls trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and, hence, surface expression of GluA2, a subunit of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs). The role of AMPARs in synaptic transmission varies depending on the combination of subunits (GluA1, GluA2 and GluA3) they incorporate. RAB39B downregulation in mouse hippocampal neurons skews AMPAR composition towards non GluA2-containing Ca2+ -permeable forms and thereby alters synaptic activity, specifically in hippocampal neurons. We posit that the resulting alteration in synaptic function underlies cognitive dysfunction in RAB39B-related disorders. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Wolfe Street, Suite 300, Baltimore, MD, 21205 USA","Background: Several lines of evidence indicate mitochondrial impairment in the pathophysiology of autism. As one of the most common biomarkers for mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number has also been linked to autism, but the relationship between mtDNA copy number and autism was still obscured. In this study, we performed a case-control study to investigate whether mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood cells is related to patients with autism. Methods: Relative mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood cells was measured by using real-time polymerase chain reaction method. The participants in this study included 78 patients with childhood autism and 83 typically developing children. Results: We observed children with autism had significantly elevated relative mtDNA copy number than healthy controls (Beta = -0.173, P = 0.0003). However, there were no significant correlations between mtDNA copy number and clinical features (paternal age, maternal age, age of onset, illness of duration, CARS score and ABC score) in childhood autism. Conclusion: We show that elevated mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood is associated with autism, indicating that there may be mitochondrial dysfunction in children with autism. © 2015 Chen et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","ABC; Autism; CARS; Mitochondrial dysfunction; mtDNA copy number",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928235866

However, according to recent empirical and self-advocacy studies, individuals with ASD identify with others with ASD. Based on mutual understanding, individuals with ASD respond empathically to others with these disorders. Results have shown that typically developing (TD) adults identify with TD fictional characters, and that such identification plays a critical role in social cognition. TD individuals retrieve episodes involving TD individuals faster than they retrieve episodes involving ASD individuals. Individuals with ASD also show a “similarity effect” whereby they retrieve stories involving ASD individuals more effectively when the stories have consistent outcomes than when they have inconsistent outcomes. In this context, I hypothesized that similarities between a perceiver and a target facilitate cognitive processing. This hypothesis was named the “similarity hypothesis”. Perceivers empathize with targets similar to themselves, which facilitates subsequent cognitive processing. Behavioral and neuroimaging studies are reviewed based on the similarity hypothesis. © 2015 Komeda.","Autism spectrum disorder; Empathy; fMRI; Other; Self; Similarity; VmPFC","(2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)., , Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association; Ayaya, S., Kumagaya, S., (2010) Tsunagari-No-Saho; Onaji-Demo-Naku Chigau-Demo-Naku (in Japanese)., , Tokyo: NHK Publishing co; Baron-Cohen, S., (1995) Mindblindness: An Essay on Autism and Theory of Mind., , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Baron-Cohen, S., The hyper-systemizing, assortative mating theory of autism (2006) Prog.

Children born in NYC to resident mothers from 1994–2001 were identified through vital statistics records (N = 927,003). Records were linked to data from NYC Early Intervention (EI) Program through 2004. The independent parental age-specific odds of having an ASD before 36 months of age were estimated using multiple logistic regression controlling for risk factors. The increase in ASD attributable to changes in parental age at birth was examined. Births to mothers and fathers 35 years or older increased 14.9 and 11.5 %, respectively, between 1994 and 2001. ASD prevalence in EI increased significantly from 1 in 3,300 children born in 1994 to 1 in 233 children born in 2001. Children born to mothers ages 25–29, 30–34 and 35 or older had significantly greater odds of being diagnosed with ASD than children of mothers younger than 25 years (OR 1.5, 1.6, and 1.9, respectively). Children born to fathers ages 35 or older (OR 1.4) had greater odds of ASD than children of fathers younger than 25. The change in parental age accounted for only 2.7 % of the increase in ASD prevalence. Older paternal age and maternal age were independently associated with increased risk of ASD. However, while parental age at birth increased between the 1994 and 2001 birth cohorts in NYC, it did not explain the increase in number of ASD cases. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","ASD; Autism; Autism spectrum disorders; Early Intervention; Maternal age; Parental age; Paternal age",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925012859

Results revealed that 4 of 5 scales met criteria for “good” validity, including two broad band scales (instruments not restricted to screening for autism). The current results suggest that validity differences might be a function of how instruments sample across the DSM content domains. Specifically, high validity instruments included a higher proportion of items assessing social interaction skills. The availability of valid broad- and narrow-band instruments, as well as implications for constructing future screening instruments, is discussed. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Assessment; Autism; Autism spectrum disorder; Diagnostic validity; Rating scales; Screening",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925002806

To understand potential factors that may impact treatment response, the current study explores the role of parental anxiety in youth treatment outcome. Thirty-one youth with ASD, ages 7–18, and their parents participated in the study. Parents completed the State/Trait Anxiety Inventory pre- and post-treatment. Contrary to previous research, there was no correlation between parental anxiety and youth anxiety at baseline or post-treatment. However, parental trait anxiety significantly decreased from pre- to post-treatment for parents of treatment responders. The findings are consistent with previous research and suggest a youth-to-parent influence. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Autism; Parent; State anxiety; Trait anxiety; Treatment",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924973602

Although the general synaptic role of neuroligins is undisputed, their specific functions at a synapse remain unclear, even controversial. Moreover, many neuroligin gene mutations were associated with autism, but the pathophysiological relevance of these mutations is often unknown, and their mechanisms of action uninvestigated. Here, we examine the synaptic effects of an autism-associated neuroligin-4 substitution (called R704C), which mutates a cytoplasmic arginine residue that is conserved in all neuroligins. We show that the R704C mutation, when introduced into neuroligin-3, enhances the interaction between neuroligin-3 and AMPA receptors, increases AMPA-receptor internalization and decreases postsynaptic AMPA-receptor levels. When introduced into neuroligin-4, conversely, the R704C mutation unexpectedly elevated AMPA-receptor-mediated synaptic responses. These results suggest a general functional link between neuroligins and AMPA receptors, indicate that both neuroligin-3 and -4 act at excitatory synapses but perform surprisingly distinct functions, and demonstrate that the R704C mutation significantly impairs the normal function of neuroligin-4, thereby validating its pathogenicity.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 17 March 2015; doi:10.1038/mp.2015.20. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924956080

Unfortunately, the corresponding systematic capture of patient phenotypic variation needed to fully interpret the impact of genetic variation has lagged far behind. Exploiting deep and systematic phenotyping of a cohort of 197 patients presenting with heterogeneous developmental disorders and whose genomes harbour de novo CNVs, we systematically applied a range of commonly-used functional genomics approaches to identify the underlying molecular perturbations and their phenotypic impact. Grouping patients into 408 non-exclusive patient-phenotype groups, we identified a functional association amongst the genes disrupted in 209 (51%) groups. We find evidence for a significant number of molecular interactions amongst the association-contributing genes, including a single highly-interconnected network disrupted in 20% of patients with intellectual disability, and show using microcephaly how these molecular networks can be used as baits to identify additional members whose genes are variant in other patients with the same phenotype. Exploiting the systematic phenotyping of this cohort, we observe phenotypic concordance amongst patients whose variant genes contribute to the same functional association but note that (i) this relationship shows significant variation across the different approaches used to infer a commonly perturbed molecular pathway, and (ii) that the phenotypic similarities detected amongst patients who share the same inferred pathway perturbation result from these patients sharing many distinct phenotypes, rather than sharing a more specific phenotype, inferring that these pathways are best characterized by their pleiotropic effects. © 2015 Andrews et al.",,"Dolk, H., Loane, M., Garne, E., The prevalence of congenital anomalies in Europe (2010) Adv Exp Med Biol, 686, pp. 349-364; Schaaf, C.P., Wiszniewska, J., Beaudet, A.L., Copy number and SNP arrays in clinical diagnostics (2011) Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet, 12, pp. 25-51; van Zelst-Stams, W.A., Scheffer, H., Veltman, J.A., Clinical exome sequencing in daily practice: 1,000 patients and beyond (2014) Genome Med, 6, p. 2; de Ligt, J., Willemsen, M.H., van Bon, B.W., Kleefstra, T., Yntema, H.G., Diagnostic exome sequencing in persons with severe intellectual disability (2012) N Engl J Med, 367, pp. 1921-1929; Robinson, P.N., Deep phenotyping for precision medicine (2012) Hum Mutat, 33, pp. 777-780; Houle, D., Govindaraju, D.R., Omholt, S., Phenomics: the next challenge (2010) Nat Rev Genet, 11, pp. 855-866; Ramanan, V.K., Shen, L., Moore, J.H., Saykin, A.J., Pathway analysis of genomic data: concepts, methods, and prospects for future development (2012) Trends Genet, 28, pp. 323-332; Vidal, M., Cusick, M.E., Barabasi, A.L., Interactome networks and human disease (2011) Cell, 144, pp. 986-998; Oti, M., Brunner, H.G., The modular nature of genetic diseases (2007) Clin Genet, 71, pp. 1-11; Stankiewicz, P., Lupski, J.R., Structural variation in the human genome and its role in disease (2010) Annu Rev Med, 61, pp. 437-455; Kohler, S., Doelken, S.C., Mungall, C.J., Bauer, S., Firth, H.V., The Human Phenotype Ontology project: linking molecular biology and disease through phenotype data (2014) Nucleic Acids Res, 42, pp. 966-974; Robinson, P.N., Kohler, S., Bauer, S., Seelow, D., Horn, D., The Human Phenotype Ontology: a tool for annotating and analyzing human hereditary disease (2008) Am J Hum Genet, 83, pp. 610-615; Webber, C., (2011)Kariminejad, R., Lind-Thomsen, A., Tumer, Z., Erdogan, F., Ropers, H.H., High frequency of rare copy number variants affecting functionally related genes in patients with structural brain malformations (2011) Hum Mutat, 32, pp. 1427-1435; Gai, X., Xie, H.M., Perin, J.C., Takahashi, N., Murphy, K., Rare structural variation of synapse and neurotransmission genes in autism (2012) Mol Psychiatry, 17, pp. 402-411; Steinberg, J., Webber, C., The roles of FMRP-regulated genes in autism spectrum disorder: single- and multiple-hit genetic etiologies (2013) Am J Hum Genet, 93, pp. 825-839; Noh, H.J., Ponting, C.P., Boulding, H.C., Meader, S., Betancur, C., Network topologies and convergent aetiologies arising from deletions and duplications observed in individuals with autism (2013) PLoS Genet, 9, p. 1003523; Webber, C., Hehir-Kwa, J.Y., Nguyen, D.Q., de Vries, B.B., Veltman, J.A., Forging links between human mental retardation-associated CNVs and mouse gene knockout models (2009) PLoS Genet, 5, p. 1000531; Doelken, S.C., Kohler, S., Mungall, C.J., Gkoutos, G.V., Ruef, B.J., Phenotypic overlap in the contribution of individual genes to CNV pathogenicity revealed by cross-species computational analysis of single-gene mutations in humans, mice and zebrafish (2013) Dis Model Mech, 6, pp. 358-372; Andorf, C., Dobbs, D., Honavar, V., Exploring inconsistencies in genome-wide protein function annotations: a machine learning approach (2007) BMC Bioinformatics, 8, p. 284; Gillis, J., Pavlidis, P., Assessing identity, redundancy and confounds in Gene Ontology annotations over time (2013) Bioinformatics, 29, pp. 476-482; Schnoes, A.M., Brown, S.D., Dodevski, I., Babbitt, P.C., Annotation error in public databases: misannotation of molecular function in enzyme superfamilies (2009) PLoS Comput Biol, 5, p. 1000605; Lee, I., Marcotte, E.M., Integrating functional genomics data (2008) Methods Mol Biol, 453, pp. 267-278; Wabnik, K., Hvidsten, T.R., Kedzierska, A., Van Leene, J., De Jaeger, G., Gene expression trends and protein features effectively complement each other in gene function prediction (2009) Bioinformatics, 25, pp. 322-330; Ashburner, M., Ball, C.A., Blake, J.A., Botstein, D., Gene ontology: tool for the unification of biology.

In this study, we examined if a similar negative adaptation effect for perceptual causality occurs in children, both typically developing and with autism. Previous studies have reported diminished adaptation for face identity, facial configuration and gaze direction in children with autism. To test whether diminished adaptive coding extends beyond high-level social stimuli (such as faces) and could be a general property of autistic perception, we developed a child-friendly paradigm for adaptation of perceptual causality. We compared the performance of 22 children with autism with 22 typically developing children, individually matched on age and ability (IQ scores). We found significant and equally robust adaptation aftereffects for perceptual causality in both groups. There were also no differences between the two groups in their attention, as revealed by reaction times and accuracy in a change-detection task. These findings suggest that adaptation to perceptual causality in autism is largely similar to typical development and, further, that diminished adaptive coding might not be a general characteristic of autism at low levels of the perceptual hierarchy, constraining existing theories of adaptation in autism. © 2015 Karaminis et al.",,"Rolfs, M., Dambacher, M., Cavanagh, P., Visual adaptation of the perception of causality (2013) Curr Biol., 23, pp. 250-254. , PMID: 23313360; Schlottmann, A., Allen, D., Linderoth, C., Hesketh, S., Perceptual causality in children (2002) Child Dev., 73, pp. 1656-1677. , PMID: 12487485; Schlottmann, A., Surian, L., Do 9-month-olds perceive causation-At-A-distance?

ADNP was originally discovered as a protein that is secreted from glial cells in response to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). VIP is a major neuroprotective peptide in the CNS and PNS and was also associated with social recognition in rodents and aggression, pair-bonding and parental behaviors in birds. Comparative sequence alignment revealed high evolutionary conservation of ADNP in Chordata. Despite its importance in brain function, ADNP has never been studied in birds. Zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) are highly social songbirds that have a sexually dichotomous anatomical brain structure, with males demonstrating a developed song system, presenting a model to study behavior and potential sexually dependent fundamental differences. Here, using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we discovered sexually dichotomous and age related differences in ADNP mRNA expression in three different regions of the song bird brain-cerebellum, cerebrum, and brain stem. Higher levels of ADNP mRNA were specifically found in young male compared to the female cerebrum, while aging caused a significant 2 and 3-fold decrease in the female and male cerebrum, respectively. Furthermore, a comparison between the three tested brain regions revealed unique sex-dependent ADNP mRNA distribution patterns, affected by aging. Future studies are aimed at deciphering the function of ADNP in birds, toward a better molecular understanding of sexual dichotomy in singing behavior in birds. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP); Aging; QRT-PCR; Sexual dimorphism; Songbird brain; Zebra finch",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928390103
