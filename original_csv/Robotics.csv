In this contribution, we present an approach that improves upon our previous work that is now able to estimate the DOAs of multiple mobile speech sources, while being light in resources, both hardware-wise (only using three microphones) and software-wise. This approach takes advantage of the fact that simultaneous speech sources do not completely overlap each other. To evaluate the performance of this approach, a multi-DOA estimation evaluation system was developed based on a corpus collected from different acoustic scenarios named Acoustic Interactions for Robot Audition (AIRA). © 2015, Rascon et al.; licensee Springer.","Kalman filter; Mobile sound sources; Multi-DOA; Three-mic array","Schmidt, R., Multiple emitter location and signal parameter estimation (1986) IEEE Trans.

However, the relatively low stiffness of the robot can seriously affect its positioning accuracy and its machining quality. In this paper, a posture optimization method is presented, aiming at increasing the stiffness of the robot in machining applications. First, a performance index is proposed to evaluate the stiffness of the robot with a given posture after an in-depth study of the relationship between the translational displacement of the robot end effector and the force applied on it. The index is then demonstrated to be a frame invariant. By maximizing the index, a robot posture optimization model is further established and solved by a novel solution method based on the Jacobian matrix. Finally, experimental results achieved on a KUKA KR360-2 robot verify the correctness of the stiffness performance index, and the application of the posture optimization method in a robotic drilling system shows its effectiveness. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Machining; Performance index; Posture optimization; Robot; Stiffness","Devlieg, R., Sitton, K., Feikert, E., Inman J.

In this paper we investigate teenagers' robot representation, with special concerns to educational robots. By robot representation we mean its (i) ontological and (ii) functional status. Particularly, we seek to understand whether teenagers' judgment about (i) and (ii) changes when they become acquainted with robots. To this aim, we carried out an experimental study with pre- and post-questionnaires with 79 participants during a robotic event: the RoboParty®. Results show that building and programming a robot fosters a more nuanced judgment about robots' belonging to the living and non-living categories but, on the other side, a more definite judgment about the educative functions that a robot may serve. Thus, at this stage of technology development in contemporary society, robots seem to share something with living entities and some other things with non-living ones. Just like living entities, robots hold an ontological status that admits degrees; similarly to non-living entities, robots need to have a precise function in order for users to have a meaningful interaction with them. Moreover, contrary to our prediction and to current literature, no new category - beyond those of living and non-living ones-seems to emerge in teenagers' ontology.

Navigation and control of a mobile robot in an unstructured environment are one of the most challenging problems. Fuzzy logic control is a useful tool in the field of navigation of mobile robot. In this research, fuzzy logic controller is optimized by integrating fuzzy logic with other soft computing techniques like genetic algorithm, neural networks, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Soft computing techniques are used in this work to tune the membership function parameters of fuzzy logic controller to improve the navigation performance. Four methods have been designed and implemented: manually constructed fuzzy logic (M-Fuzzy), fuzzy logic with genetic algorithm (GA-Fuzzy), fuzzy logic with neural network (Neuro-Fuzzy), and fuzzy logic with PSO (PSO-Fuzzy). The performances of these approaches are compared through computer simulations and experiment number of scenarios using Khepera III mobile robot platform. Hybrid fuzzy logic controls with soft computing techniques are found to be most efficient for mobile robot navigation. The GA-Fuzzy technique is found to perform better than the other techniques in most of the test scenarios in terms of travelling time and average speed. The performances of both PSO-Fuzzy and Neuro-Fuzzy are found to be better than the other methods in terms of distance travelled. In terms of bending energy, the PSO-Fuzzy and Neuro-Fuzzy are found to be better in simulation results. Although, the M-Fuzzy is found to be better using real experimental results. Hence, the most important system parameter will dictate which of the four methods to use. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","ANFIS; Fuzzy logic; Genetic algorithm; Mobile robot navigation; Particle swarm optimization;

The resulting locomotion mechanism has several features in common with peristaltic locomotion that can be found in the animal world. The purpose of the present paper is to examine the feasibility of, and design guidelines for, a locomotion mechanism that exploits the control of intrinsic curvature on a rough surface. With the help of a quasi-static analysis of a continuous model of a soft robot's limb, we show precisely how locomotion is induced and how the performance can be enhanced by controlling the curvature profile. Our work provides a framework for the theoretical analysis of the locomotion of the soft robot and the resulting analysis is also used to develop some design guidelines. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Researchers from different fields have succeeded in solving the IK of different robot configurations for various applications. However, the challenge of computational efficiency still remains, in particular for complex robot configurations, to be used for real-time applications. This paper presents a novel, computationally efficient method of performing IK for general 2n + 1 (n is the number of joints) DOF manipulators with a spherical joint at the wrist. It uses the simplicity of analytical solutions to enhance the speed of numerical solvers that operate on each joint location individually. The problem of IK is approached as a constrained optimization, where obstacle avoidance and limit avoidance at joints are used as illustrations. The joint limitations are handled implicitly as boundary conditions for the numerical algorithm. The algorithm was executed and implemented on various paths for a 9 DOF arm and also simulated for a 13 DOF arm for generalization purposes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

With a haptic robot, participants made series of vertical pointing actions on a virtual surface, which was sometimes postponed by a small temporal delay (15 or 65. ms). Subjects then evaluated their subjective feeling of control. Results showed that after temporal distortions, the hand-trajectories were adapted effectively but that the feeling of control decreased significantly. This was observed even in the case of subliminal distortions for which subjects did not consciously detect the presence of a distortion. Our findings suggest that both supraliminal and subliminal temporal distortions that occur within a healthy perceptual-motor system impact the conscious experience of the feeling of control of self-initiated motor actions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Agency; Consciousness; Feeling of control; Haptic feedback; Internal models; Motor control; Prediction","Cohen, N.J., Squire, L.R., Preserved learning and retention of pattern-analyzing skill in amnesia: Dissociation of knowing how and knowing that (1980) Science (New York, N.Y.), 210 (4466), pp. 207-210; Collins, C.J.S., Barnes, G.R., Predicting the unpredictable: Weighted averaging of past stimulus timing facilitates ocular pursuit of randomly timed stimuli (2009) The Journal of Neuroscience, 29 (42), pp. 13302-13314; Dean, I., Harper, N.S., McAlpine, D., Neural population coding of sound level adapts to stimulus statistics (2005) Nature Neuroscience, 8 (12), pp. 1684-1689; Delevoye-Turrell, Y., Giersch, A., Danion, J.-M., Abnormal sequencing of motor actions in patients with schizophrenia: Evidence from grip force adjustments during object manipulation (2003) The American Journal of Psychiatry, 160 (1), pp. 134-141; Desmurget, M., Sirigu, A., A parietal-premotor network for movement intention and motor awareness (2009) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 13 (10), pp. 411-419; Dewey, J.A., Pacherie, E., Knoblich, G., The phenomenology of controlling a moving object with another person (2014) Cognition, 132 (3), pp. 383-397; Fourneret, P., Jeannerod, M., Limited conscious monitoring of motor performance in normal subjects (1998) Neuropsychologia, 36 (11), pp. 1133-1140; Franck, N., Farrer, C., Georgieff, N., Marie-Cardine, M., Daléry, J., d' Amato, T., Defective recognition of one's own actions in patients with schizophrenia (2001) The American Journal of Psychiatry, 158 (3), pp. 454-459; Frith, C.D., Blakemore, S., Wolpert, D.M., Abnormalities in the awareness and control of action (2000) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The methodology is valid for three-degree-of-freedom planar or spatial parallel manipulators. The paper explains step-by-step a process to take advantage of a parallel manipulator that owns the cuspidality property, and thus, it can perform non-singular transitions. The latter ability enables the robot to move among different solutions of the direct kinematic problem, resulting in a wider workspace in comparison to a design that does not have this transitioning capacity. Therefore, it makes sense to incorporate the cuspidality property as one design criteria which is exactly the main purpose of the present research. The proposed design methodology exploits the cuspidality property to find a set of optimum designs that widen the workspace of the manipulator and, in addition to this, maintain a regular shape of the singularity locus existing in the workspace. Moreover, the design procedure includes the evaluation of the condition number of the Jacobian matrix, providing the set of designs that yield a well conditioned matrix. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using soft silicone elastomer (Ecoflex 00-50) and liquid metal alloy (Galinstan), we present the characterization of an electrofluidic strain sensor. The originality of such sensor lies in the capability to resist to large deformation (higher than 200% cycled 150 times). Several device designs have been investigated to enhance the electrical response of the sensor as a function of its elongation. We discuss here the results of cyclic deformation and strain on the sensor. We also present a theoretical study based on a numerical simulation performed with COMSOL Multi-Physics and an analytical model of the sensor's response to elongation. Numerical simulations were done based on the Mooney-Rivlin model for hyper-elastic materials. The analytical calculations were obtained considering the evolution of the sensor resistance according to the variations of the channel's dimensions. The two methods have shown a very good correlation with the experimental results. They offer new possibilities to design and prototype sensors suitable for application involving large deformation such as soft robots or wearable sensors to monitor physiological parameters. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The algorithm splits the process into a set of iterative steps with decreasing spray-gun stroke diameters. Thus, it can efficiently build up the image starting with large strokes to paint the larger details of the image. Then, with increasingly smaller strokes, it can paint the rest of the smaller details. The target image is segmented and a tool-path is computed. A set of critical points in the image is then chosen to avoid oversaturation and used to implement an algorithm to calculate spray-gun operational speed at each path point. Eventually, such conditions lead to a linear system which is solved using an ordinary least squares method. Depending on the image to reproduce, this methodology promises to be far more efficient than painting processes where the image is built entirely at the smallest detail level. For this reason, it would be particularly suitable for large building façade decoration, for example. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Ordinary least squares; Path-planning; Robot; Spray painting; Voronoi","Balkan, T., Arikan, M.A.S., Modeling of paint flow rate flux for circular paint sprays by using experimental paint thickness distribution (1999) Mech.

When this technique is applied to A∗ with an admissible heuristic it yields substantial runtime savings, at the expense of sacrificing solution optimality. Its applicability to real-time heuristic search, a search approach that builds upon heuristic search, however, has only been explored by a few studies. In this article we present two new approaches to using weights in real-time heuristic search, applicable to a wide range of algorithms. The first one, weighted lookahead, is a variant of an existing approach by Shimbo and Ishida, and utilizes the weight while the algorithm performs lookahead search. The second one, weighted update, incorporates the weight to the edges of the search graph during the learning phase. We implemented both techniques within LSS-LRTA∗ and evaluated them in path-planning benchmarks. We show that weighted lookahead outperforms an existing approach by Shimbo and Ishida but that it does not improve over existing approaches that do not use weights. Weighted update, on the other hand, yields performance improvements of up to one order of magnitude both in solution cost and total search time. To illustrate further the generality of weighted update, we incorporate the technique in two other well-known real-time heuristic search algorithms: LRTA∗-LS and daLSS-LRTA∗, and we empirically show significant improvements for LRTA∗-LS and modest but still important improvements for daLSS-LRTA∗. We analyze the properties of weighted update in depth, showing, among other things, that it guarantees termination. Convergence behavior of LSS-LRTA∗, modified to use weighted update, is also analyzed. In such a setting, we prove solutions are w-optimal, and provide additional bounds on solution quality that in practice are tighter than w-optimality. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In a wind farm, the energy production of the downstream wind turbines decreases due to reduced wind speed and increased level of turbulence caused by the wakes formed by the upstream wind turbines. As a result, the wake interference among wind turbines lower the overall power efficiency of the wind farm. To improve the overall efficiency of a wind farm, researchers have studied the wind farm layout optimization problem to find the placement locations of wind turbines that maximize the expected wind farm power. Most studies on wind farm layout optimization employ heuristic search-based optimization algorithms. In spite of their simplicity, optimization algorithms based on heuristic search are computationally expensive and have limitation in optimizing the locations of a large number of wind turbines since the computational time for the search tends to increase exponentially with increasing number of wind turbines. This study employs a mathematical optimization scheme to efficiently and effectively optimize the locations of a large number of wind turbines with respect to maximizing the wind farm power production. To formulate the mathematical optimization problem, we derive a continuous wake model and express the expected wind farm power as a continuous and smooth function in terms of the locations of the wind turbines. The constructed wind farm power function is then maximized using sequential convex programming (SCP) for the nonlinear mathematical problem. We show how SCP can be used to evaluate the efficiency of an existing wind farm and to optimize a wind farm layout consisting of 80 wind turbines. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Sequential Convex Programming; Wind farm layout optimization; Wind power","Mosetti, G., Poloni, C., Diviacco, B., Optimization of wind turbine positioning in large wind farms by means of a genetic algorithm (1994) J Wind Eng Ind Aerodynam, 51, pp. 105-116; Ozturk, A., Norman, B., Heuristic methods for wind energy conversion system positioning (2004) Electr Power Syst Res, 70, pp. 179-185; Mora, J., Barón, J., Santos, J., Payán, M., An evolutive algorithm for wind farm optimal design (2007) Neurocomputing, 70, pp. 2651-2658; González, J., Rodriguez, A., Mora, J., Santos, J., Payán, M., Overall design optimization of wind farms (2011) Renew Energy, 36, pp. 1973-1982; González, J., Payán, M., Santos, J., González-Longatt, F., A review and recent developments in the optimal wind-turbine micro-siting problem (2014) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 30, pp. 133-144; Jensen, N.O., (1983) A note on wind generator interaction, , Tech rep Risø-M2411(EN), Risø National Laboratory; Katic, I., Hojstrup, J., Jensen, N., A simple model for cluster efficiency (1986) Proc of European wind energy association conference and exhibition, pp. 407-410; WasP [Software] (2011), Roskilde, DenmarkWindFarmer [Software] (2014), Høvik, NorwayWindPro [Software] (2011), Aalborg, DenmarkOpenWind [Software] (2008), Albany, NY, USAGrady, S.A., Hussaini, M.Y., Abdullah, M.M., Placement of wind turbines using genetic algorithms (2005) Renew Energy, 30 (2), pp. 259-270; Elkinton, C.N., Manwell, J.F., McGowan, J.G., Algorithms for offshore wind farm layout optimization (2008) Wind Eng, 32 (1), pp. 67-84; González, J., Rodriquez, A., Mora, J., Santos, J., Payan, M., Optimization of wind farm turbines layout using an evolutive algorithm (2010) Renew Energy, 35, pp. 1671-1681; Şişbot, S., Turgut, Ö., Tunç, M., Çamdali, Ü., Optimal positioning of wind turbines on Gökçeada using multi objective genetic algorithm (2010) Wind Energy, 13, pp. 297-306; Emami, A., Noghreh, P., New approach on optimization in placement of wind turbines within wind farm by genetic algorithms (2010) Renew Energy, 35, pp. 1559-1564; Chen, Y., Li, H., Jin, K., Song, Q., Wind farm layout optimization using genetic algorithm with different hub height wind turbines (2013) Energy Convers Manage, 70, pp. 56-65; Marmidis, G., Lazarou, S., Pyrgioti, E., Optimal placement of wind turbines in a wind park using Monte Carlo simulation (2008) Renew Energy, 33, pp. 1455-1460; Bilbao, M., Alba, E., Simulated annealing for optimization of wind farm annual profit (2009), 2nd International symposium on logistics and industrial informatics, Linz, AustriaBilbao, M., Alba, E., CHC and SA applied to wind energy optimization using real data (2010) Proceedings of 2010 IEEE congress on evolutionary computation, pp. 1-8; Kusiak, A., Song, Z., Design of wind farm layout for maximum wind energy capture (2010) Renew Energy, 35, pp. 685-694; Eroğlu, Y., Seckiner, S.U., Design of wind farm layout using ant colony algorithm (2012) Renew Energy, 44, pp. 53-62; Eroğlu, Y., Seckner, U., Wind farm layout optimization using particle filtering approach (2013) Renew Energy, 58, pp. 95-107; Du Pont, B., Cagan, J., An extended pattern search approach to wind farm layout optimization (2012) J Mech Des, 134; Wan, C., Wang, J., Yang, G., Gu, H., Zhang, X., Wind farm micro-sitting by Gaussian particle swarm optimization with local search strategy (2012) Renew Energy, 48, pp. 276-286; Veeramachaneni, K., Wagner, M., O'Reilly, U., Neumann, F., Optimizing energy output and layout costs for large wind farms using particle swarm optimization (2012) The proceedings of 2012 IEEE congress on evolutionary computation; Chowdhury, S., Zhang, J., Messac, A., Castillo, L., Unrestricted wind farm layout optimization: investigating key factors influencing the maximum power generation (2012) Renew Energy, 38, pp. 16-30; Chowdhury, S., Zhang, J., Messac, A., Castillo, L., Optimizing the arrangement and the selection of turbines for a wind farm subject to varying wind conditions (2013) Renew Energy, 52, pp. 273-282; Willson, D., Cussat-Blanc, S., Veeramachaneni, K., O'Reilly, U., Luga, H., A continuous developmental model for wind farm layout optimization (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 conference on genetic and evolutionary computation, pp. 745-752; Ainslie, J.P., Calculating the flow field in the wake of wind turbines (1988) J Wind Eng Ind Aerodynam, 27, pp. 213-224; Bartl, J., (2011) Wake measurement behind an array of two model wind turbines, , M.S.

We studied how pairs of human subjects (referred to as dyads) collaborate physically to attenuate external mechanical perturbations during a target tracking task. Subjects tracked a target moving in a slow and predictable way using wrist flexion/extension movements, with and without destabilizing torque perturbations. Dyad strategies were classified using interaction torques and muscular activity. During unperturbed interactions (baseline), the dyads tended to stabilize on a particular strategy. The baseline strategy was not the same in all dyads, suggesting that the solution to the task was not global but specific to each particular dyad. After several trials of unperturbed interactions, we introduced mechanical vibrations and analyzed the adaptation process. Dyads showed a tendency to counteract the external disturbances by first increasing co-contraction within each subject (independent co-contraction), and then raising the amount of opposing interaction torques (dyadic co-contraction) with increased perturbation amplitude. The introduction of perturbations impelled dyads to abandon their unperturbed baseline strategy and adopt a more common strategy across dyads, suggesting attractor solutions. Our results establish a framework for future human-human interaction studies, and have implications in human motor control as well as human-robot and robot-robot interactions. © 2015.","Human-human interaction; Interpersonal coordination; Joint motor action","Rahman, M.M., Ikeura, R., Mizutani, K., Control characteristics of two humans in cooperative task (2000) SMC 2000 Conference Proceedings: 2000 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man & Cybernetics, pp. 1301-1306; Gentry, S., Feron, E., Murray-Smith, R., Human-human haptic collaboration in cyclical Fitts' tasks (2005) 2005 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2005), pp. 3402-3407; Reed, K., Peshkin, M., Hartmann, M.J., Grabowecky, M., Patton, J., Yishton, P.M., Haptically linked dyads are two motor-control systems better than one?

In this work, a dipping robot equipped with an ultrasonic bath has been developed to prepare thin, homogenous surface-mounted MOFs (SURMOFs) with well-defined thicknesses and orientations. SURMOFs of type HKUST-1, prepared with and without ultrasonication, were characterized by means of XRD, SEM, AFM and UV-vis spectroscopy. It was found that the MOF films prepared with ultrasonication are significantly cleaner, more homogenous and have a considerably smaller surface roughness than MOF films prepared without ultrasonication. The higher film quality results in a tremendously improved transparency, making them perfectly suited for optical applications. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The study had two main objectives: (1) to show that hypothetical control variables, namely, referent coordinates and apparent stiffness of vertical hand position and grip force can be measured in an experiment; and (2) to establish relation(s) between these control variables that yield the classic grip-force-load-force coupling. Healthy subjects gripped a handle and performed vertical oscillations between visual targets at one of five metronome-prescribed frequencies. A HapticMaster robot was used to induce slow changes in the vertical force applied to the handle, while the size of the handle was changed slowly leading to changes in the grip aperture. The subjects were instructed not to react to possible changes in the external forces. A linear, second-order model was used to reconstruct the referent coordinate and apparent stiffness values for each phase of the vertical oscillation cycle using across-cycle regressions. The reconstructed time profiles of the referent coordinates and apparent stiffness showed consistent trends across subjects and movement frequencies. To validate the method, these values were used to predict the vertical force and the grip force applied to the handle for movement cycles that were not utilized in the reconstruction process. Analysis of the coupling between the four variables, two referent coordinates and two apparent stiffness values, revealed a single strong constraint reflecting the coupling between the grip force and vertical force. We view these data as providing experimental support for the idea of controlling natural, multi-muscle actions with shifts in a low-dimensional set of referent coordinates. © 2015 IBRO.","Endpoint stiffness; Grip apparent stiffness; Grip force; Grip-force-load-force coupling; Referent configuration hypothesis; Referent trajectories","Ambike, S., Paclet, F., Latash, M.L., Zatsiorsky, V.M., Grip-force modulation in multi-finger prehension during wrist flexion and extension (2013) Exp Brain Res, 227, pp. 509-522; Ambike, S., Paclet, F., Zatsiorsky, V.M., Latash, M.L., Factors affecting grip force: anatomy, mechanics, and referent configurations (2014) Exp Brain Res, 232, pp. 1219-1231; Barto, A.G., Fagg, A.H., Sitkoff, N., Houk, J.C., A cerebellar model of timing and prediction in the control of reaching (1999) Neural Comput, 11, pp. 565-594; Bellomo, A., Inbar, G., Examination of the gamma equilibrium point hypothesis when applied to single degree of freedom movements performed with different inertial loads (1997) Biol Cybern, 76, pp. 63-72; Bennett, D.J., Torques generated at the human elbow joint in response to constant position errors imposed during voluntary movements (1993) Exp Brain Res, 95, pp. 488-498; Bennett, D.J., Hollerbach, J.M., Xu, Y., Hunter, I.W., Time-varying stiffness of human elbow joint during cyclic voluntary movement (1992) Exp Brain Res, 88, pp. 433-442; Bernstein, N.A., The problem of interrelation between coordination and localization (1935) Arch Biol Sci, 38, pp. 1-35. , (Russian); Bizzi, E., Accornero, N., Chapple, W., Hogan, N., Arm trajectory formation in monkeys (1982) Exp Brain Res, 46, pp. 139-143; Cannon, S.C., Zahalak, G.I., The mechanical behavior of active human skeletal muscle in small oscillations (1982) J Biomech, 15, pp. 111-121; Feldman, A.G., Functional tuning of the nervous system with control of movement or maintenance of a steady posture.

Actual jaw motions and SEMG signals from the masticatory muscles were recorded and used as output and input, respectively. Three separate TDANNs/AR-TDANNs were used to predict displacement (in terms of position/orientation), velocity, and acceleration. The optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer and total duration of delays were obtained for each TDANN/AR-TDANN and each subject through a genetic algorithm (GA). The kinematic modeling of a human-like masticatory robot, based on a 6-universal-prismatic-spherical parallel robot, is described. The structure and motion variables of the robot were determined. The closed-form solution of the inverse kinematic problem (IKP) of the robot was found by vector analysis. Thereafter, the framework for an EMG-based human mastication robot interface is explained. Predictions by AR-TDANN were superior to those by TDANN. SEMG signals from mastication muscles contained important information about the mandibular kinematic parameters. This information can be employed to develop control systems for rehabilitation robots. Thus, by predicting the subject's movement and solving the IKP, we provide applicable tools for EMG-based masticatory robot control. © 2015, Elsevier Ltd.

We formulate this problem as two multi-objective path planning models with the focus on robot's energy consumption and path's safety. These models address two five- and three-objectives optimization problems. We propose an evolutionary algorithm for solving the problems. For efficient searching and achieving Pareto-optimal regions, in addition to the standard genetic operators, a family of path refiner operators is introduced. The new operators play a local search role and intensify power of the algorithm in both explorative and exploitative terms. Finally, we verify the models and compare efficiency of the algorithm and the refiner operators by other multi-objective algorithms such as strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 and multi-objective particle swarm optimization on several complicated path planning test problems. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, recent studies have shown that the use of a position sensor is helpful in realizing efficient power transmission. In response, we have proposed a passive position sensing method that shares a common structure with a wireless charging system, enabling cost reduction, and space reduction because of integration of multiple functions into a single system and batteryless and cost-effective transponders because of passive sensing. The sensing method is useful for efficient wireless charging or even long-range navigation for mobile robots such as automated guided vehicles. However, the error characteristics of the sensor have not been previously studied. Therefore, the error characteristics of the position sensing were derived through error analysis in this paper. Moreover, the first actual experiment of 3-D position estimation was conducted to demonstrate the appropriateness of the position sensing method and to analyze the error characteristics. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","coupled magnetic resonances; error characteristics; Passive position sensing; three-dimensional position sensing; wireless charging","Kurs, A., Karalis, A., Moffatt, R., Joannopoulos, J.D., Fisher, P., Soljacic, M., Wireless power transfer via strongly coupled magnetic resonances (2007) Science, 317 (5834), pp. 83-86; Liu, S., Liu, S., Zhou, Y., Cui, T.J., An optimizable circuit structure for high-efficiency wireless power transfer (2013) IEEE Trans.

This study has surpassed the traditional mode and achieved the exterior placement of the measurement sensors to make it possible for the measurement in narrow space. To fulfill the need of measurement on small bores in different position and direction, a new flexible in-line measurement system is set up utilizing the movement platform of industrial robots. Firstly, the design of the measurement system is proposed based on analysis of the preliminary method, and the flow of the work is given. Then, the question of alignment between sensor and sample is analyzed in detail, and a novel, reasonable method of aligning is given. Based on the aligned system, the measuring experiment is carried out on 0.6 mm, 1.0 mm and 2.0 mm simulated defects on interior wall of 10 mm diameter bore, and the standard deviation is almost less than 0.01 mm. The experimental results show that the system is valid and able to accomplish the feasible, on-line measurement. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This arm operates inside the patient's body through a small orifice which constrains the end-effector's translation along two axes. The workspace of such a robotic arm depends on its design as well as orifice location. Conventionally, the design of such an arm is optimized for large workspace and high dexterity. However, this large workspace might be reachable through only a few orifices, thus making the workspace volume and operation quite sensitive to the orifice location. To overcome this problem, we optimized the design of a 3 degrees of freedom serial robotic arm to attain multiple adjacent (desired number of) possible orifice locations, through which a planar workspace of pre-specified geometry can be traced. To achieve this goal, an algorithm was developed to relate the design of such an MIRS arm to the possible orifice positions. The optimization problem was solved using several metaheuristics such as simulated annealing, Tabu search, artificial bee colonization and genetic algorithm, and their performance was compared. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, stationary samplers may not represent the personal exposure of children aged 3 and younger since they may not detect particles resuspended from the floor as children play. To address this issue, an autonomous robot, the Pretoddler Inhalable Particulate Environmental Robotic (PIPER) sampler, was developed to simulate the movements of children as they play on the floor. PIPER and a stationary sampler simultaneously measured particle number concentration in six size channels (0.3-10. μm) using an optical particle counter in 65 homes in New Jersey, USA. For all investigated particle sizes, higher particle resuspension was observed by PIPER compared to the stationary sampler. In 71% of carpeted homes a more significant (at the α = 0.05 level) resuspension of particles larger than 2.5. μm was observed by PIPER compared to the stationary sampler. Particles larger than 2.5. μm were resuspended more efficiently than smaller particles, over both carpeted and bare floors. This demonstrates that PIPER is able to resuspend particles through movement, and provide a better characterization of the resuspended particles than stationary samplers.

They can process a variety of products in the same system and thus helps to achieve higher productivity. At the same time the components in FMC are more prone to failure because of their high operating rate. Further, it becomes more complex when components follow different failure distributions and it is difficult to plan suitable maintenance interventions. To this effect, in the present paper the authors present a hybrid framework by contemporaneous adoption of qualitative and quantitative techniques to model and analyze the failure aspects in FMC. On qualitative part potential failure modes w.r.t. various robot components are identified and risk priority number is obtained using failure mode and effect analysis. On quantitative analysis, use of Generalized Stochastic Petri Net is made and simulation experiments were carried out to model and analyze the performance of FMC (3 Machines 1 Robot). Cases of both reliable and unreliable FMC are investigated. © 2014, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","Flexible manufacturing cell; FMEA; Petri nets; Throughput","Bloch-Mercier, S., A preventive maintenance policy with sequential checking procedure for a Markov deteriorating system (2002) Eur J Oper Res, 147, pp. 548-576; Boschian, V., Rezg, N., Chelbi, A., Contribution of simulation to the optimization of maintenance strategies for a randomly failing production system (2009) Eur J Oper Res, 197, pp. 1142-1149; Chen, C.T., Chen, Y.W., Yuan, J., On a dynamic preventive maintenance policy for a system under inspection (2003) Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 80, pp. 41-47; Gurler, U., Kaya, A., A maintenance policy for a system with multi-state components: an approximate solution (2002) Reliab Eng Saf, 6 (2), pp. 117-127; Halim, T., Tang, L., Confidence interval for optimal preventive maintenance interval and its applications in maintenance planning (2009) Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 40, pp. 203-213; Lin, D., Zuo, M.J., Yam, R.C., Sequential imperfect preventive maintenance models with two categories of failure modes (2001) Naval Res Logist (NRL), 48 (2), pp. 172-183; Maheshwari, S., Sharma, P., Jain, M., Unreliable flexible manufacturing cell with common cause failure (2010) Int J Eng Sci Technol, 2 (9), pp. 4701-4716; Military Handbook Reliability prediction for electronic equipment, MIL-HDK 217F, Department of Defense USAPhilip, A., Sharma, R.K., A stochastic reward net approach for reliability analysis of a flexible manufacturing module (2013) Int J Syst Assur Eng Manag, 4 (3), pp. 293-302; RADC Non electronic reliability notebook, RADC-TR-85-94Rupe, J., Kuo, W., An assessment framework for optimal FMS effectiveness (2003) Int J Flex Manuf Syst, 15, pp. 151-165; Savsar, M., Reliability analysis of a flexible manufacturing cell (2000) Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 67, pp. 147-152; Savsar, M., Performance analysis of an FMS operating under different failure rate and maintenance policies (2005) Int J Flex Manuf Syst, 16, pp. 229-249; Savsar, M., Aldaihani, M., Modeling of machine failures in a flexible manufacturing cell with two machines served by a robot (2008) Reliab Eng Syst Safety, 93, pp. 1551-1562; Sharma, R.K., Kumar, S., Performance modeling in critical engineering systems using RAM analysis (2008) Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 93 (2008), pp. 891-897; Sheu, S.H., Griffith, W.S., Optimal age-replacement policy with age-dependent minimal-repair and random-leadtime (2001) IEEE Trans Reliab, 5 (3), pp. 302-309; Sheu, S.H., Lin, Y.B., Liao, G.L., Optimal policies with decreasing probability of imperfect maintenance (2005) IEEE Trans Reliab, 54 (2), pp. 347-357; Sheu, S.H., Lin, Y.B., Liao, G.L., Optimum policies for a system with general imperfect maintenance (2006) Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 91, pp. 362-369; Tsai, Y.T., Wangb, K.S., Tsai, L.C., A study of availability-centered preventive maintenance for multi-component systems (2004) Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 84, pp. 261-270; Vineyard, M., Meredith, J.R., Amoako-Gyampah, K., Failure rate distributions for flexible manufacturing systems: an empirical study (1999) Eur J Oper Res, 116, pp. 139-155; Wang, H., A survey of maintenance policies of deteriorating systems (2002) Eur J Oper Res, 139, pp. 469-489; Wu, S., Croome, D.C., Optimal maintenance policies under different operational schedules (2005) IEEE Trans Reliab, 54 (2), pp. 338-346; Zhao, Y.X., On preventive maintenance policy of a critical reliability level for system subject to degradation (2003) Reliab Eng Saf, 79, pp. 301-308",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929411735

However, in real-world scenarios there are uncertainties associated to sensing, control and modelling errors that make the assembly task very complex. In addition, there are also unmodeled uncertainties that have to be taken into account for an effective control algorithm to succeed. Among these uncertainties, it can be mentioned disturbances, backlash and aging of mechanisms. In this paper, a method to overcome the effect of those uncertainties based on the Fuzzy ARTMAP artificial neural network (ANN) to successfully accomplish the assembly task is proposed. Experimental work is reported using an industrial 6 DOF robot arm in conjunction with a vision system for part location and wrist force/torque sensing data for assembly. Force data is fed into an ANN evolving controller during a typical peg in hole (PIH) assembly operation. The controller uses an incremental learning mechanism that is solely guided by the sensed forces. In this article, two approaches are presented in order to compare the incremental learning capability of the manipulator. The first approach uses a primitive knowledge base (PKB) containing 16 primitive movements to learn online the first insertion. During assembly, the manipulator learns new patterns according to the learning criteria which turn the PKB into an enhanced knowledge base (EKB). During a second insertion the controller uses effectively the EKB and operation improves. The second approach employs minimum information (it contains only the assembly direction) and the process starts from scratch. After several operations, that knowledge base increases by including only the needed patterns to perform the insertion. Experimental results showed that the evolving controller is able to assemble the matting pairs enhancing its knowledge whenever it is needed depending on the part geometry and level of expertise. Our approach is demonstrated through several PIH operations with different tolerances and part geometry. As the robot’s expertise evolves, the PIH operation is carried out faster with shorter assembly trajectories. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Fuzzy ARTMAP; Incremental learning; Learning criterion; Unknown environments","Angelov, P., Filev, D., Kasabov, N., (2010) Evolving intelligent systems: methodology and applications, , IEEE Press Series on Computational Intelligence, Willey; Asada, H., Teaching and learning of compliance using neural nets (1990) IEEE Int Conf Robot Autom, pp. 1237-1244; Baek, J., Lee, H., Lee, B., Lee, H., Kim, E., An efficient genetic selection of the presentation order in simplified fuzzy ARTMAP patterns (2014) Appl Soft Comput, 22, pp. 101-107; Bruzzone, L.E., Molfino, R.M., Zoppi, M., Modelling and control of peg-in-hole assembly performed by a translational robot (2002) In: Proceedings of the International Conference Modeling Identification and Control, Austria; Carpenter, G.A., Grossberg, S., Markunzon, N., Reynolds, J.H., Rosen, D.B., Fuzzy ARTMAP: a neural network architecture for incremental learning of analog multidimensional maps (1992) IEEE Trans Neural Netw, 3 (5), pp. 698-713; Chen, Y., Han, X., Okada, M., Chen, Y., Naghdy, F., Intelligent robotic peg-in-hole insertion learning based on haptic virtual environment (2007) In: Computer-Aided Design and Computer Graphics, 2007 10th IEEE International Conference on; Cervera, E., del Pobil, A.P., Learning and classification of contact states in robotic assembly tasks (1996) In: Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on IEA/AIE; Cervera, E., del Pobil, A.P., Programming and learning in real-world manipulation tasks (1997) In: IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robot and Systems; Duan, F., Tan, J.T.C., Zhang, Y., Watanabe, K., Pongthanya, N., Sugi, M., Arai T (2007) Analyze assembly skills using a motion simulator (2007) Biomimetics, 2007, pp. 1428-1433. , ROBIO: IEEE International Conference on; Gama, J., Aguilar, J., Knowledge discovery from data streams (2007) Intell Data Anal, 11, 2p; Gonçalves, P.J.S., Lopes, P.J.F., Torres, P.M.B., Sequeira, J.M.R., Evolving fuzzy uncalibrated visual servoing for mobile robots (2013) Comput Intell Decis Making, pp. 57-68; Gullapalli, V., Franklin, J.A., Benbrahim, H., Acquiring robot skills via reinforcement learning (1994) IEEE Control Systems, pp. 13-24; Howarth, M., An investigation of task level programming for robotic assembly (1998) Ph.D, , Thesis: The Nottingham Trent University; Huang, L., Song, Q., Kasabov, N., Evolving connectionist systems based role allocation of robots for soccer playing.

Being of reactive nature, the method is intended for local navigation. The robots are anonymous, the navigation system is fully decentralized and there in not need of leader or specific coordination protocol. Robots can simply navigate holding the cohesion of the group or they can also navigate building up some kind of formation. The method can be implemented providing a set of simple suitable rules to the robots. It has been consistently tested both in simulations and experiments carried out on robot formations, proving to be reliable.

In order to tackle this issue, we introduce human-friendly robot partner to support the elderly people in their daily life. However, to realize this, it is essential for the robot partner to be able to have a natural communication with the human. This paper proposes a new communication framework between the human and robot partner based on relevance theory as the basis knowledge. The relevance theory is implemented to build mutual cognitive environment between the human and the robot partner, namely as the informationally structured space (ISS). Inside the ISS, robot partner employs both verbal as well as non-verbal communication to understand human. For the verbal communication, Rasmussen's behavior model is implemented as the basis for the conversational system. While for the non-verbal communication, environmental and human state data along with gesture recognition are utilized. These data are used as the perceptual input to compute the robot partner's emotion. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our proposed communication framework in establishing natural communication between the human and the robot partner. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to design, create, and evaluate a new semi-automatic snake robot for NOTES. Materials and methods: The snake robot employs the characteristics of both a manual endoscope and a multi-segment snake robot. This robot is inserted and retracted manually, like a classical endoscope, while its shape is controlled using embedded robot technology. The feasibility of a prototype robot for NOTES was evaluated in animals and human cadavers. Results: The transverse stiffness and maneuverability of the snake robot appeared satisfactory. It could be advanced through the anus as far as the peritoneal cavity without any injury to adjacent organs. Preclinical tests showed that the device could navigate the peritoneal cavity. Conclusions: The snake robot has advantages of high transverse force and intuitive control.

Specifically, a trajectory tracking controller is proposed to coordinately guide a platoon of robots, with an obstacle deviation subsystem based on virtual forces and mechanical impedance implemented in each robot. Such a controller is firstly designed for groups of three robots and then generalized to larger groups ($$n>3$$n>3 robots), by proposing a modular structure based on the concatenation of triangular modules, composing a polygon of $$n$$n sides (one of the designed controllers is adopted to guide each module). The stability of the closed-loop control system is also proven for each individual control system, based on the theory of Lyapunov, taking into account the saturation of the control signals, adopted to prevent the saturation of the robot actuators. Based on such a proof, a conjecture that the whole control system is stable is presented, which is supported by several simulated and experimental results, some of which are presented, thus validating the proposed control structure. © 2015, Brazilian Society for Automatics--SBA.","Formation control; Mobile robots; Theory of Lyapunov","Antonelli, G., Arrichiello, F., Chiaverini, S., The entrapment/escorting mission (2008) IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine, 15 (1), pp. 22-29; Balch, T., Arkin, R.C., Behavior-based formation control for multiagent robot teams (1998) IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation, 14 (6), pp. 926-934; Brandao A.

However, this assumes that the control law can perfectly track the desired trajectory, which is impossible due to modeling errors. This paper proposes a robust multi-model approach allowing parallel robots to cross Type 2 singularities. The main idea is to shift near singularities to a simplified dynamic model that can never degenerate. The two main contributions are the definition of an optimal trajectory crossing Type 2 singularities and the multi-model control law allowing to track this trajectory. The proposed control law is validated experimentally through a Five-bar planar mechanism. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Computed torque control; Multi-model approach; Parallel robots; Singularities","Arakelian, V., Briot, S., Glazunov, V., Increase of singularity-free zones in the workspace of parallel manipulators using mechanisms of variable structure (2008) Mechanism and Machine Theory, 43 (9), pp. 1129-1140; Briot, S., Arakelian, V., On the dynamic properties of rigid-link flexible-joint parallel manipulators in the presence of Type 2 singularities (2010) Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics, 2 (2), p. 021004; Briot, S., Arakelian, V., Chablat, D., Optimal force generation in parallel manipulators for passing through the singular positions (2008) International Journal of Robotics Research, 27 (8), pp. 967-983; Briot, S., Gautier, M., Global Identification of Drive Gains and Dynamic Parameters of Parallel Robots - Part 1: Theory,"" Proceedings of the 19th CISM-IFToMM Symposium on Robot Design (2012), Dynamics, and Control (ROMANSY 2012)Conconi, M., Carricato, M., A new assessment of singularities of parallel kinematic chains (2009) Proceedings of international conference on robotics and automation, 25 (4), pp. 757-770; Craig, J.J., Hall, P.P., (2005) Introduction to robotics, , Pearson/Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA; Gautier, M., Dynamic identification of robots with power model (1997) Proceedings of international conference on robotics and automation, 3, pp. 1922-1927; Ghorbel, F., Chételat, O., Longchamp, R., A reduced model for constrained rigid bodies with application to parallel robots (1994) Proceedings of the IFAC symposium on robot control, (3), pp. 57-62; Glazunov, V., Arakelian, V., Briot, S., Rashoyan, G.V., Speed and force criteria for the proximity to singularities of parallel structure manipulators (2012) Journal of Machinery Manufacture and Reliability, 41 (3), pp. 194-199; Gogu, G., Structural synthesis of fully-isotropic translational parallel robots via theory of linear transformations (2004) European Journal of Mechanics A/Solids, 23 (6), pp. 1021-1039; Gosselin, C., Angeles, J., Singularity analysis of closed-loop kinematic chains (1990) Proceedings of international conference on robotics and automation, 6 (3), pp. 281-290; Ider, S., Inverse dynamics of parallel manipulators in the presence of drive singularities (2005) Mechanism and Machine Theory, 40 (1), pp. 33-44; Khalil, W., Dombre, E., Modeling, identification and control of robots (2004), 56. , HermesKong, K., Gosselin, C., A class of 3-dof translational parallel manipulators with linear input-output equations (2002), pp. 3-4. , In The workshop on fundamental issues and future research directions for parallel mechanisms and manipulatorsKurtz, R., Hayward, V., Multiple-goal kinematic optimization of a parallel spherical mechanism with actuator redundancy (1992) Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 8, pp. 644-651; Liu, X.J., Wang, J., Pritschow, G., Performance atlases and optimum design of planar 5R symmetrical parallel mechanisms (2006) Mechanism and Machine Theory, 41, pp. 119-144; Merlet, J., (2006) Parallel robots, , Springer; Nahon, M., Angeles, J., Force optimization in redundantly-actuated closed kinematic chains Proceedings of international conference on robotics and automation; Paccot, F., Andreff, F., Martinet, P., A review on the dynamic control of parallel kinematic machine: Theory and experiments (2009) International Journal of Robotics Research, 28 (3), pp. 395-416; Rakotomanga, N., Chablat, D., Caro, S., Kinetostatic performance of a planar parallel mechanism with variable actuation (2006) Advances in robot kinematics: Analysis and design, pp. 311-320; Samson, C., Robust control of a class of nonlinear systems and applications to robotics (1987) International Journal of Adaptive Control and Signal Processing, 1 (1), pp. 49-68; Spong, M., Hutchinson, S., Vidyasagar, M., Robot modeling and control (2006), 3. , New York: WileyVoglewede, P., Ebert-Uphoff, I., Measuring ""closeness"" to singularities for parallel manipulators (2004) Proceedings of international conference on robotics and automation, pp. 4539-4544; Zein, M., Wenger, P., Chablat, D., Non-singular assembly-mode changing motions for 3-RPR parallel manipulators (2008) Mechanism and Machine Theory, 43 (4), pp. 480-490; Zlatanov, D., Bonev, I., Constraint singularities of parallel mechanisms Proceedings of international conference on robotics and automation.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923306585

Total pancreatectomy retains the challenges of uncinate process dissection and digestive reconstruction, but avoids the risk of pancreatic fistula, and could be a suitable operation to highlight the advantages of robotic assistance in pancreatic resections. Methods: Eleven laparoscopic robot-assisted total pancreatectomies (LRATP) were compared to 11 case-matched open total pancreatectomies. All operations were performed by one surgeon during the same period of time. Robotic assistance was employed in half of the patients, based on robot availability at the time of surgery. Variables examined included age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, body mass index, estimated blood loss, need for blood transfusions, operative time, tumor type, tumor size, number of examined lymph nodes, margin status, post-operative complications, 90-day or in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, and readmission rate. Results: No LRATP was converted to conventional laparoscopy, hand-assisted laparoscopy or open surgery despite two patients (18.1 %) required vein resection and reconstruction. LRATP was associated with longer mean operative time (600 vs. 469 min; p = 0.014) but decreased mean blood loss (220 vs. 705; p = 0.004) than open surgery. Post-operative complications occurred in similar percentages after LRATP and open surgery. Complications occurring in most patients (5/7) after LRATP were of mild severity (Clavien-Dindo grade I and II). One patient required repeat laparoscopic surgery after LRATP, to drain a fluid collection not amenable to percutaneous catheter drainage. One further patient from the open group required repeat surgery because of bleeding. No patient had margin positive resection, and the mean number of examined lymph nodes was 45 after LRATP and 36 after open surgery. Conclusions: LRATP is feasible in selected patients, but further experience is needed to draw final conclusions. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Da Vinci; Laparosocopy; Robot; Total pancreatectomy","Moorthy, K., Munz, Y., Dosis, A., Hernandez, J., Martin, S., Bello, F., Rockall, T., Darzi, A., Dexterity enhancement with robotic surgery (2004) Surg Endosc, 18, pp. 790-795. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD2czhsFWjsQ%3D%3D, PID: 15216862; Turchetti, G., Palla, I., Pierotti, F., Cuschieri, A., Economic evaluation of da Vinci-assisted robotic surgery: a systematic review (2012) Surg Endosc, 26, pp. 598-606. , PID: 21993935; Boggi, U., Signori, S., Vistoli, F., D’Imporzano, S., Amorese, G., Consani, G., Guarracino, F., Mosca, F., Laparoscopic robot-assisted pancreas transplantation: first world experience (2012) Transplantation, 93, pp. 201-206. , PID: 22245834; Asimakopoulos, A.D., Miano, R., Di Lorenzo, N., Spera, E., Vespasiani, G., Mugnier, C., Laparoscopic versus robot-assisted bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: comparison of pentafecta rates for a single surgeon (2013) Surg Endosc, 27, pp. 4297-4304. , PID: 23807752; Barbash, G.I., Friedman, B., Glied, S.A., Steiner, C.A., Factors associated with adoption of robotic surgical technology in US hospitals and relationship to radical prostatectomy procedure volume (2014) Ann Surg, 259, pp. 1-6. , PID: 23965894; Brody, F., Richards, N.G., Review of robotic versus conventional laparoscopic surgery (2014) Surg Endosc, 28 (5), pp. 1413-1424. , PID: 24357422; Paul, S., McCulloch, P., Sedrakyan, A., Robotic surgery: revisiting “no innovation without evaluation (2013) BMJ, 346, p. f1573. , PID: 23479593; Waters, J.A., Canal, D.F., Wiebke, E.A., Dumas, R.P., Beane, J.D., Aguilar-Saavedra, J.R., Ball, C.G., Schmidt, C.M., Robotic distal pancreatectomy: cost effective?

In particular, the error model is brought to a quasi-linear-parameter-varying (LPV) form suitable for designing an error-feedback controller. It is shown that, if polytopic techniques are used to reduce the number of constraints from infinite to finite, a solution within the standard LPV framework could not exist due to a singularity that appears in the possible values of the input matrix. Adding a switching component to the controller allows solving this problem. Moreover, a switching LPV virtual actuator is added to the control loop in order to obtain fault tolerance within the fault-hiding paradigm, keeping the stability and some desired performances under the effect of actuator faults without the need of retuning the nominal controller. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown and proved through simulation and experimental results. © 2014 IEEE.","fault tolerant control (FTC); identification; linear parameter varying (LPV) systems; Mobile robots; model reference; switched systems; tracking; virtual actuators","Oliveira, H.P., Sousa, A.J., Moreira, A.P., Costa, P.J., Modeling and assessing of omni-directional robots with three and four wheels (2009) Contemporary Robotics-Challenges and Solutions, , A.

We study airbrush painting because it resembles in many ways manual welding, a standard industrial task. The experiments are performed with the 7 degrees of freedom KUKA lightweight robot arm. The robot is controlled in admittance using a force sensor attached at the end-point, so as to act as a free-mass and be passively guided by the human. For impedance measurements, a set of nine subjects perform 12 repetitions of airbrush painting, drawing a straight-line on a cartoon horizontally placed on a table, while passively moving the airbrush mounted on the robot's end-point. We measure hand impedance during the painting task by generating sudden and brief external forces with the robot. The results show that on average the dominant hand displays larger impedance than the nondominant in the directions perpendicular to the painting line. We find the most significant difference in the damping values in these directions. Based on this observation, we develop a ""directional damping"" scheme for robotic assistance and conduct a pilot study with 12 subjects to contrast airbrush painting with and without robotic assistance. Results show significant improvement in precision with both dominant and nondominant hands when using robotic assistance. © 2014 IEEE.","Assistive robotics; hand impedance measurement; handedness; human-robot interaction; man machine systems","Erden, M.S., Maric, B., Assisting manual welding with robot (2011) Robot.

The locomotion dynamics on or within soft substrates such as granular material (GM) has not been fully investigated. This paper proposes a hybrid force model to simulate and evaluate the locomotion performance of a legged terrestrial robot in GM. The model incorporates an improved Resistive Force Theory (RFT) model and a failure-based model. The improved RFT model integrates the force components of individual leg elements over the curved leg portion submerged in GM at any moment during a full period of leg rotation. The failure-based model is applied in a bar drag model to yield the normal and the lateral forces of the individual RFT elements as functions of the locomotion depth and speed. The hybrid model is verified by the coincidence between the theoretical predictions and the experimental results. The hybrid model is used to analyze the effects of angular velocity and leg shape with high precision and can guide the design of the legs with any profiles. Our study reveals that the interactions between locomotor and substrate are determined by the locomotor structural characteristics, the nature of the substrate, and the control strategy. © 2015 ISTVS.

This study aims to explore the frictional and viscous properties of the intestinal environment as encountered by expanding-extending robotic endoscopes in order to optimize the design of robotic endoscopy. Two models of intestinal deformation were built according to the different states between robot and intestine, and then the three axial forces experienced by robot were analyzed: Coulomb friction, marginal resistance, and viscous resistance. The proposed models were verified through a custom-made experimental platform, and the experimental results showed that the axial force of the robot body was between 0.1 and 0.4N; the anchoring force was obviously bigger than the force of the robot body if the anchoring diameter was 10mm larger than the diameter of intestine. In this paper, the effects of the axial motion mechanism's speed to the force of the robot body and anchoring mechanism were analyzed according to the models we built and the experimental results. The research helps further the study of the mechanical characteristics of the intestine and the development of robotic endoscope. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Friction model; Intestine; Marginal resistance; Robotic endoscope","Valdastri, P., Simi, M., Webster, R.J., III, Advanced technologies for gastrointestinal endoscopy (2012) Annu.

Each sensor has a limited transmission range and the mobile robot must get into the coverage of each sensor node to obtain the sensing data. To minimize the energy consumption on the traveling of the mobile robot, it is significant to plan a data collection path with the minimum length to complete the data collection task. In this paper, we observe that this problem can be formulated as traveling salesman problem with neighborhoods, which is known to be NP-hard. To address this problem, we apply the concept of artificial bee colony (ABC) and design an ABC-based path planning algorithm.

Sofias Str, Xanthi, Greece","In robot localization, particle filtering can estimate the position of a robot in a known environment with the help of sensor data. In this paper, we present an approach based on particle filtering, for accurate stereo matching. The proposed method consists of three parts. First, we utilize multiple disparity maps in order to acquire a very distinctive set of features called landmarks, and then we use segmentation as a grouping technique. Secondly, we apply scan line particle filtering using the corresponding landmarks as a virtual sensor data to estimate the best disparity value. Lastly, we reduce the computational redundancy of particle filtering in our stereo correspondence with a Markov chain model, given the previous scan line values. More precisely, we assist particle filtering convergence by adding a proportional weight in the predicted disparity value estimated by Markov chains. In addition to this, we optimize our results by applying a plane fitting algorithm along with a histogram technique to refine any outliers. This work provides new insights into stereo matching methodologies by taking advantage of global geometrical and spatial information from distinctive landmarks. Experimental results show that our approach is capable of providing high-quality disparity maps comparable to other well-known contemporary techniques. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Ground control points; Markov chains; Particle filters; Plane fitting; Stereo matching","Scharstein, D., Szeliski, R., A taxonomy and evaluation of dense two-frame stereo correspondence algorithms (2002) Int.

In our previous studies based on open and laparoscopic TME, we found that pelvic MRI-based pelvimetry could well reflect anatomical difficulty of the pelvis and operative time increased in direct proportion to the difficulty. We explored different outcomes of robotic surgery for TME based on classifications of difficult pelvic anatomies to determine whether this method can overcome these challenges. Methods: We reviewed data from 182 patients who underwent robotic surgery for rectal cancer between January 2008 and August 2010. Patient demographics, pathologic outcomes, pelvimetric results, and operative and postoperative outcomes were assessed. The data were compared between easy, moderate, and difficult groups classified by MRI-based pelvimetry. Results: Comparing the three groups, there was no difference between the groups in terms of operative and pathologic outcomes, including operation time. High BMI, history of preoperative chemoradiotherapy, and lower tumor levels were significantly associated with longer operation time (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.009), but the pelvimetric parameter was not. Conclusion: There was no difference between the easy, moderate, and difficult groups in terms of surgical outcomes, such as operation time, for robotic rectal surgery. The robot system can provide more comfort during surgery for the surgeon, and may overcome challenges associated with difficult pelvic anatomy. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Pelvic anatomy; Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Pelvimetry; Rectal neoplasm; Robot surgery","Heald, R.J., Husband, E.M., Ryall, R.D., The mesorectum in rectal cancer surgery—the clue to pelvic recurrence?

The state-of-the-art pipeline of paralinguistic speech analysis utilizes brute-force feature extraction, and the features need to be tailored according to the relevant task. In this work, we extend a recent discriminative projection based feature selection method using the power of stochasticity to overcome local minima and to reduce the computational complexity. The proposed approach assigns weights both to groups and to features individually in many randomly selected contexts and then combines them for a final ranking. The efficacy of the proposed method is shown in a recent paralinguistic challenge corpus to detect level of conflict in dyadic and group conversations. We advance the state-of-the-art in this corpus using the INTERSPEECH 2013 Challenge protocol. © 2014 IEEE.","CCA; computational paralinguistics; discriminative projection; feature selection; random projection","Martinez, C., Cruz, A., Emotion recognition in non-structured ut terances for human-robot interaction (2005) IEEE Int.

We aimed to quantify the isolated labrum's stabilizing value. Five human cadaveric hips were mounted to a robotic manipulator, and subluxation potential tests were run with and without labrum. Three-dimensional (3D) kinematic data were quantified using the stability index (Colbrunn et al., 2013, ""Impingement and Stability of Total Hip Arthroplasty Versus Femoral Head Resurfacing Using a Cadaveric Robotics Model,"" J. Orthop. Res., 31(7), pp. 1108-1115). Global and regional stability indices were significantly greater with labrum intact than after total labrectomy for both anterior and posterior provocative positions. In extreme positions, the labrum imparts significant overall mechanical resistance to hip subluxation. Regional stability contributions vary with joint orientation.

This problem has been recently proposed and it is motivated by manufacturing processes where each operation has to be assisted by one of a limited number of human operators. We propose a new schedule generation scheme for this problem, termed $$ OG \& T $$OG&T, and prove that it can generate optimal schedules for any instance. This scheme can be used in different settings such as heuristic search, to define a branching strategy, or evolutionary algorithms, to define a decoder. In order to evaluate $$ OG \& T $$OG&T, we herein consider the first option and exploit it to devise an any-time exact algorithm. This algorithm is enhanced with two heuristic estimations, designed from two problem relaxations, and with a pruning method which relies on dominance properties among states of the search. The algorithm is evaluated across several benchmarks and compared with other approaches. The results of the experimental study show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Exact methods; Heuristic search; Job-shop scheduling problem with operators; Schedule generation schemes","Agnetis, A., Flamini, M., Nicosia, G., Pacifici, A., A job-shop problem with one additional resource type (2011) Journal of Scheduling, 14 (3), pp. 225-237; Artigues, C., Lopez, P., Ayache, P., Schedule generation schemes for the job shop problem with sequence-dependent setup times: Dominance properties and computational analysis (2005) Annals of Operations Research, 138, pp. 21-52; Baptiste, P., Le Pape, C., Nuijten, W., (2001) Constraint-based scheduling, , Kluwer, Norwell, MA, USA:; Beasley, J.E., Or-library: Distributing test problems by electronic mail (1990) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 41 (11), pp. 1069-1072; Bierwirth, C., A generalized permutation approach to jobshop scheduling with genetic algorithms (1995) Operations Research Spectrum, 17, pp. 87-92; Blazewicz, J., Scheduling under resource constraints: Deterministic models.

Intertemporal choices are ubiquitous, and comparative studies reveal commonalities and differences across species: all species devalue future rewards as a function of delay (delay aversion), yet there is a lot of inter-specific variance in how rapidly such devaluation occurs. These differences are often interpreted in terms of ecological rationality, as depending on environmental factors (. e.g., feeding ecology) and the physiological and morphological constraints of different species (. e.g., metabolic rate). Evolutionary hypotheses, however, are hard to verify in vivo, since it is difficult to observe precisely enough real environments, not to mention ancestral ones. In this paper, we discuss the viability of an approach based on evolutionary robotics: in Study 1, we evolve robots without a metabolism in five different ecologies; in Study 2, we evolve metabolic robots (. i.e., robots that consume energy over time) in three different ecologies. The intertemporal choices of the robots are analyzed both in their ecology and under laboratory conditions. Results confirm the generality of delay aversion and the usefulness of studying intertemporal choice through experimental evolutionary robotics. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Delay discounting; Ecological rationality; Evolutionary robotics; Intertemporal choice; Preferences; Spatial discounting","Addessi, E., Bellagamba, F., Delfino, A., De Petrillo, F., Focaroli, V., Macchitella, L., Maggiorelli, V., Paglieri, F., Waiting by mistake: symbolic representation of rewards modulates intertemporal choice in capuchin monkeys preschool children and adult humans (2014) Cognition, 130, pp. 428-441; Addessi, E., Paglieri, F., Focaroli, V., The ecological rationality of delay tolerance: insights from capuchin monkeys (2011) Cognition, 119, pp. 142-147; Ainslie, G., Impulse control in pigeons (1974) J.

We have developed a dual docking technique for both the splenic flexure and the pelvis. We report our initial experience of robotic left colectomy using this technique for left-sided colon cancer. Methods: The study group comprised 61 patients who underwent robotic left colon cancer resection using our dual docking technique between July 2008 and January 2013. Operations comprised two stages: colon mobilization (stage 1) followed by pelvic dissection (stage 2). After completion of stage 1, the robot arms were undocked and the operating table was rotated 60° counterclockwise until a 45° angle was created between the patient cart and the operating table. Results: All 61 procedures were technically successful without the need for conversion to laparoscopic or open surgery. Median total operation, 1st docking, and 2nd docking times were 227 min (range, 137–653 min), 4 min (range, 3–8 min), and 3 min (range, 3–9 min), respectively. Estimated blood loss was 20 ml (range, 20–2,000 ml). Median time to soft diet was 2 days (range, 2–12 days) and median length of hospital stay was 7 days (range, 4–20 days). Median total number of lymph nodes harvested was 17 (range, 3–61). According to the Clavien–Dindo classification, the numbers of complications for grades 1, 2, 3a, 3b, and 4 were 10, 2, 3, 3, and 1. There was no mortality within 30 days. Conclusions: Robotic left colon cancer resection using our dual docking technique is safe and feasible. This procedure can maximize splenic mobilization in robotic colorectal surgery. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Colectomy; Colonic neoplasm; Robotics","Clavien, P.A., Barkun, J., de Oliveira, M.L., Vauthey, J.N., Dindo, D., Schulick, R.D., de Santibanes, E., Makuuchi, M., The Clavien–Dindo classification of surgical complications: five-year experience (2009) Ann Surg, 250 (2), pp. 187-196. , PID: 19638912; Jayne, D.G., Guillou, P.J., Thorpe, H., Quirke, P., Copeland, J., Smith, A.M., Heath, R.M., Brown, J.M., Randomized trial of laparoscopic-assisted resection of colorectal carcinoma: 3-year results of the UK MRC CLASICC Trial Group (2007) J Clin Oncol, 25 (21), pp. 3061-3068. , PID: 17634484; COLOR Study Group, COLOR: a randomized clinical trial comparing laparoscopic and open resection for colon cancer (2000) Dig Surg, 17 (6), pp. 617-622; Fleshman, J., Sargent, D.J., Green, E., Anvari, M., Stryker, S.J., Beart, R.W., Jr., Hellinger, M., Nelson, H., Laparoscopic colectomy for cancer is not inferior to open surgery based on 5-year data from the COST Study Group trial (2007) Ann Surg, 246 (4), pp. 655-662. , PID: 17893502, discussion 662-654; Hasegawa, H., Kabeshima, Y., Watanabe, M., Yamamoto, S., Kitajima, M., Randomized controlled trial of laparoscopic versus open colectomy for advanced colorectal cancer (2003) Surg Endosc, 17 (4), pp. 636-640. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD3s7nvFGlsQ%3D%3D, PID: 12574925; D’Annibale, A., Morpurgo, E., Fiscon, V., Trevisan, P., Sovernigo, G., Orsini, C., Guidolin, D., Robotic and laparoscopic surgery for treatment of colorectal diseases (2004) Dis Colon Rectum, 47 (12), pp. 2162-2168. , PID: 15657669; Choi, D.J., Kim, S.H., Lee, P.J., Kim, J., Woo, S.U., Single-stage totally robotic dissection for rectal cancer surgery: technique and short-term outcome in 50 consecutive patients (2009) Dis Colon Rectum, 52 (11), pp. 1824-1830. , PID: 19966627; Hellan, M., Stein, H., Pigazzi, A., Totally robotic low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision and splenic flexure mobilization (2009) Surg Endosc, 23 (2), pp. 447-451. , PID: 19057962; Park, Y.A., Kim, J.M., Kim, S.A., Min, B.S., Kim, N.K., Sohn, S.K., Lee, K.Y., Totally robotic surgery for rectal cancer: from splenic flexure to pelvic floor in one setup (2010) Surg Endosc, 24 (3), pp. 715-720. , PID: 19688388; Luca, F., Cenciarelli, S., Valvo, M., Pozzi, S., Faso, F.L., Ravizza, D., Zampino, G., Biffi, R., Full robotic left colon and rectal cancer resection: technique and early outcome (2009) Ann Surg Oncol, 16 (5), pp. 1274-1278. , PID: 19242762; Hellan, M., Anderson, C., Ellenhorn, J.D., Paz, B., Pigazzi, A., Short-term outcomes after robotic-assisted total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer (2007) Ann Surg Oncol, 14 (11), pp. 3168-3173. , PID: 17763911; Baik, S.H., Lee, W.J., Rha, K.H., Kim, N.K., Sohn, S.K., Chi, H.S., Cho, C.H., Kim, W.H., Robotic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer using four robotic arms (2008) Surg Endosc Other Interv Tech, 22 (3), pp. 792-797; Park, I.J., You, Y.N., Schlette, E., Nguyen, S., Skibber, J.M., Rodriguez-Bigas, M.A., Chang, G.J., Reverse-hybrid robotic mesorectal excision for rectal cancer (2012) Dis Colon Rectum, 55 (2), pp. 228-233. , PID: 22228169; Jamali, F.R., Soweid, A.M., Dimassi, H., Bailey, C., Leroy, J., Marescaux, J., Evaluating the degree of difficulty of laparoscopic colorectal surgery (2008) Arch Surg, 143 (8), pp. 762-767. , PID: 18711036, discussion 768; Akiyoshi, T., Kuroyanagi, H., Oya, M., Ueno, M., Fujimoto, Y., Konishi, T., Yamaguchi, T., Factors affecting difficulty of laparoscopic surgery for left-sided colon cancer (2010) Surg Endosc, 24 (11), pp. 2749-2754. , PID: 20383534; Han, K.S., Choi, G.S., Park, J.S., Kim, H.J., Park, S.Y., Jun, S.H., Short-term outcomes of a laparoscopic left hemicolectomy for descending colon cancer: retrospective comparison with an open left hemicolectomy (2010) J Korean Soc Coloproctol, 26 (5), pp. 347-353. , PID: 21152138; Kariv, Y., Delaney, C.P., Robotics in colorectal surgery (2005) Minerva Chir, 60 (5), pp. 401-416. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD2MrjsFGquw%3D%3D, PID: 16210989; Rawlings, A.L., Woodland, J.H., Crawford, D.L., Telerobotic surgery for right and sigmoid colectomies: 30 consecutive cases (2006) Surg Endosc, 20 (11), pp. 1713-1718. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD28nlslOntg%3D%3D, PID: 17008953; Giulianotti, P.C., Coratti, A., Angelini, M., Sbrana, F., Cecconi, S., Balestracci, T., Caravaglios, G., Robotics in general surgery: personal experience in a large community hospital (2003) Arch Surg, 138 (7), pp. 777-784. , PID: 12860761; Goldstein, N.S., Sanford, W., Coffey, M., Layfield, L.J., Lymph node recovery from colorectal resection specimens removed for adenocarcinoma.

The recommended treatment of these lesions is surgical excision with biliary enteric reconstruction. In patients with normal anatomy, Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is preferred. However, different options in biliary reconstruction must be entertained in those with abnormal anatomy. Methods: Our patient is a 39-year-old female, who during workup for bariatric surgery two years prior to presentation, was found to have a 6 cm dilation of her common bile duct. She underwent a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) in 2011 at an outside facility, with no planned intervention on her biliary tree. Ultimately, she developed right upper quadrant pain two years following her RYGB. Upon further workup including right upper quadrant ultrasound, an extrahepatic choledochal cyst was confirmed and she was referred to our institution for definitive care. Results: The patient was taken to the operating room for resection of the choledochal cyst with hepatoenteric reconstruction. The dissection and resection of the cyst commenced laparoscopically. After performing a generous Kocher maneuver, we demonstrated that there was adequate mobilization of the duodenum to perform a tension free hepaticoduodenostomy, which was performed robotically. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged home on postoperative day 3. At one month follow up, the patient was doing well with symptom resolution. Her final pathology revealed a choledochal cyst which was negative for dysplasia or carcinoma. Long-term follow up has been recommended with yearly alkaline phosphatase levels. Conclusions: Here we present a video of the technical considerations during a robot-assisted laparoscopic biliary reconstruction in a patient with a prior Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with a type IVA choledochal cyst. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Choledochal cyst; Robotic/laparoscopic resection","Dumitrascu, T., Lupescu, I., Ionescu, M., The Todani classification for bile duct cysts: an overview (2012) Acta Chir Belg, 112, pp. 340-345. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BC3s7lslKjsg%3D%3D, PID: 23175921; Ohashi, T., Wakai, T., Kubota, M., Matsuda, Y., Arai, Y., Ohyama, T., Nakaya, K., Ajioka, Y., Risk of subsequent biliary malignancy in patients undergoing cyst excision for congenital choledochal cysts (2013) Gastroenterol Hepatol, 28 (2), pp. 243-247; Gloy, V.L., Briel, M., Bhatt, D.L., Kashyap, S.R., Schauer, P.R., Mingrone, G., Bucher, H.C., Nordmann AJ (2013) Bariatric surgery versus non-surgical treatment for obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

In contrast to abnormal event analysis using fixed cameras, three key problems should be tackled in this system, i.e., scene construction, robot localization, and scene comparison. For the first problem, scene construction, a clustering scheme is proposed for extracting a set of key frames from the surveillance environment. Each key frame is further divided into a set of patches, which forms a sparse representation for representing scene contents. In addition to the compression effect, the scheme can tackle the effects of misalignment and lighting changes well. For the localization problem, a novel patch matching method is proposed to reduce not only the size of the search space but also the size of the feature dimensions in similarity matching. To prune the search space, a set of projection kernels is used to construct a ring structure. Then, one order of time complexity in the similarity calculation can be reduced from the structure. After scene searching, the robot location is not always guaranteed to be successfully registered to the scene map. Thus, a novel spider-web map is proposed to tackle the effect of misalignment and then detect different exceptional scene changes from the videos. The proposed method has been rigorously tested on a variety of videos to demonstrate its superiority in object detection and abnormal scene change detection. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","abnormal scene change detection; behavior analysis; pattern matching; video surveillance","Kim, K., Chalidabhongse, T.H., Harwood, D., Davis, L., Real-time foreground-background segmentation using codebook model (2005) Real-Time Imag., 11 (3), pp. 172-185. , Jun; Stringa, E., Regazzoni, C.S., Real-time video-shot detection for scene surveillance applications (2000) IEEE Trans.

Six right-handed, right-side hemiplegic stroke survivors (55.8 ± 16.6 years old) and six age-matched neurologically-intact control subjects (55.3 ± 18.4 years old) were recruited. Each subject performed two repetitions of isometric flexion and extension maximum voluntary torques (MVTs) on each finger individually and all five fingers together in a randomised order. All joint moments were recorded. A finger individuation index (FI) was derived from the joint moments data. Correlation between the average of the FIs, namely FII, and the clinical scores was then evaluated. The results suggest that stroke subjects produce significantly lower joint moments, about one third of that of the control subjects. Significant differences in FIs were found on all fingers except the thumb, with those of the control subjects ranging from 0.5 to 0.7 compared to the 0.2 to 0.4 of the stroke subjects. FII values were found to correlate well with different clinical scores. Stroke survivors were found to be restricted by lack of both strength and individuality in their fingers. Additionally, FII could potentially serve as a continuous monitoring system of finger individuation. © 2015 The Hong Kong Institution of Engineers","exoskeleton; impairment index; rehabilitation; robot; stroke",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929598420

The traditional method of diagnosing cancers in the GI tract requires three procedures: oesophagus cancer and stomach cancer can be diagnosed using gastroscopy; intestinal cancer can be diagnosed using capsule endoscopy; and colorectal cancer can be diagnosed using colonoscopy. These separate procedures are not only expensive but also exert a great deal of stress on the human body (both gastroscopy and colonoscopy require anaesthesia). Clearly, a simple, reliable and non-invasive diagnosis procedure for the GI tract would be a major breakthrough. This paper introduces an innovative capsule endoscope, called the Tadpole Endoscope (TE), which it mimics the tadpole in the nature and adopts a thunniform swimming mode. A simplified model is derived to illustrate the propulsion principle. The TE is a type of active locomotion capsule endoscope; it is like a micro-robot fish and can propel itself along the GI tract, especially in the stomach. Through the ex vivo tests, the maximum swimming speed can reach 12.5 mm/s and the minimum turning radius is 25 mm in the stomach. © 2015 The Hong Kong Institution of Engineers","active locomotion; capsule endoscope; GI tract; maneuverability",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929600846

High gain observer is designed for velocity estimation of WMR trajectory tracking. It is shown that using high gain observer and a globally bounded state feedback stabilizing controller, the close-loop system performance can be recovered in the presence of un-modeled dynamics and disturbances.

A reaction wheel is adopted to maintain a balance while the RWBR is driving, which allows the process of controlling the speed to be achieved concurrently with the one of controlling the balance. To control the speed of the bicycle robot, a PID control algorithm with the adjustment of variable gains is developed in this study, where the gains are heuristically adjusted during each experiment. For the control of the balance and stability, a roll controller is designed by using the model-based algorithm to provide the shortest possible cycle for the bicycle controller. The roll angle is measured to maintain the desired acceleration which generates the reaction force to keep the total force acting on the bicycle robot inside the friction cone. The desired roll acceleration is decided for the bicycle robot in order to prevent it from falling down to the floor with the minimum usage of the reaction wheel rotation. For the general driving of the bicycle robot such as the S-curved driving, the dynamic forces of centrifugal, gravity and steering change are modeled and the friction on the floor has been estimated. The performance of the designed control system is verified through the real experiments with the developed RWBR. © 2015, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bicycle robot; Centrifugal force; Friction cone; Process of controlling the balance; Reaction wheel; S-curved motion","Huang, Y., Liao, Q., Wei, S., Guo, L., Dynamic modeling of a bicycle robot with front-wheel drive based on Kane’s method (2010) Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation, pp. 758-764; Zhang, Y., Li, J., Yi, J., Song, D., Balance control and analysis of stationary riderless motorcycles (2011) IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 3018-3023; Chang, T., Jaroonsiriphan, P., Bernhardt, M., Ludden, P., Web-based command shaping of Cobra 600 robot with a swinging load (2006) IEEE Trans.

This study proposes a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based terrain modeling system for large-scale LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) dataset visualization using a voxel map and a textured mesh. A 3D flag map is proposed for incrementally registering large-scale point clouds in a terrain model in real time. The sensed 3D point clouds are quantized into regular 3D grids that are allocated in the GPU memory to remove redundant spatial and temporal points. Subsequently, the sensed vertices are segmented as ground and non-ground classes. The ground indices are rendered using a textured mesh to represent the ground surface, and the non-ground indices, using a colored voxel map by a particle rendering method. The proposed approach was tested using a mobile robot equipped with a LiDAR sensor, video camera, GPS receiver, and gyroscope. The simulation was evaluated through a test in an outdoor environment containing trees and buildings, demonstrating the real-time visualization performance of the proposed method in a large-scale environment. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","GPU programming; Large-scale point cloud; Mobile robot; Real-time visualization; Terrain reconstruction","Bao, X., Pajarola, R., LOD-based clustering techniques for efficient large-scale terrain storage and visualization, proceedings SPIE conference on visualization and data analysis (2003) pp 225–235; Crowley, J.L., World modeling and position estimation for a mobile robot using ultrasonic ranging (1989) Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 674-680; Gingras, D., Lamarche, T., Bedwani, J.L., Rough terrain reconstruction for rover motion planning (2010) Conference on Computer and Robot Vision (CRV), pp. 191-198; Häselich, M., Arends, M., Wojke, N., (2012) Probabilistic terrain classification in unstructured environments, , Robotics and Autonomous Systems: Accepted; Hl, L., Shyu, M.L., Quality of service provision in mobile multimedia—a survey (2011) Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences, 1 (5), 15p; Huber, D., Herman, H., Kelly, A., Real-time photorealistic visualization of 3D environments for enhanced remote operation of vehicles, proceedings of the international conference on 3-D Digital Imaging and Modeling (3DIM) (2009) pp 1518–1525; Kammerl, J., Blodowy, N., Rusuz, R.B., Real-time compression of point cloud streams, 2012 I.E. international conference on robotics and automation (2012) pp 778–785; Kim, G.H., Huber, D., Hebert, M., Segmentation of salient regions in outdoor scenes using imagery and 3-D data (2008) IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV08), 8p; Knauer, U., Meffert, B., Fast computation of region homogeneity with application in a surveillance task (2010) Proceedings of ISPRS Commission V Mid-Term Symposium Close Range Image Measurement Techniques, pp. 337-342; Livny, Y., Kogan, Z., El-Sana, J., Seamless patches for GPU-based terrain rendering (2009) Visual Computer, 26, pp. 197-208; Matsushita, Y., Miura, J., On-line road boundary modeling with multiple sensory features, flexible road model, and particle filter (2011) J Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 59 (5), pp. 274-284; Nie, D.H., Han, K.P., Lee, H.S., GPU-based stereo matching algorithm with the strategy of population-based incremental learning (2009) Journal of Information Processing System, 5 (2), pp. 105-116; Pan, Y., Jb, Z., Parallel programming on cloud computing platforms—challenges and solutions (2012) Journal of Convergence, 3 (4), pp. 23-28; Pellenz, J., Lang, D., Neuhaus, F., Paulus, D., Real-time 3D mapping of rough terrain: a field report from disaster city, proceedings of the IEEE international workshop on safety, security and rescue robotics (2010) pp 1–6; Rovira-Más, F., Zhang, Q., Reid, J.F., Stereo vision three-dimensional terrain maps for precision agriculture (2008) J Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 60 (2), pp. 133-143; Saxena, A., Chung, S.H., Ng, A.Y., 3-D depth reconstruction from a single still image (2008) International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 76 (1), pp. 53-69; Sukumar, S.R., Yu, S.J., Page, D.L., (2006) Multiple sensors integration for unmanned terrain modeling, proceedings of SPIE unmanned systems technology, VIII (6230), pp. 65-74; (2011) HDL-32E High Definition LiDAR™ Sensor, , Velodyne LiDAR: Inc; Wang, C., Wan, T., Palmer, I.J., A real-time dynamic simulation scheme for large-scale flood hazard using 3D real world data, 11th international conference information visualization (2007) pp 607–612; Zhao, Y., Cui, X., Cheng, Y., High-performance and real-time volume rendering in CUDA, international conference on biomedical engineering and informatics (2009) pp 1–4; Zhuang Y, Wang W, Chen H et al.

While I agree with this critique to the extent to which it is levelled at an authoritarian conception of teaching as control, a conception in which the student can only exist as an object of the interventions of the teacher and never as a subject in its own right, I argue that the popular alternative to traditional teaching, that is to make the teacher a facilitator of learning, is insufficient. The reason for this has to do with the fact that learning, understood as a process of interpretation and comprehension, ultimately also does not allow the student to exist as a subject. I provide support for this point through a reading of two articles by Emmanuel Levinas in which he puts forward the case that our subjectness is not generated through our own acts of signification, but is rather constituted from the outside, that is, through the address of the other. It is in this event, where a different conception of teaching emerges—one that, unlike authoritarian teaching and unlike self-generated adaptive learning, is precisely aimed at making the subjectness of the student possible. © 2015 The Author(s).

Recent studies of neurorehabilitation using robots or brain-computer interface (BCI) technology suggest that passive motor experience would play a measurable role in motor recovery, however our knowledge of passive motor learning is limited. To clarify the effects of passive motor experience on human motor learning, we performed arm reaching experiments guided by a robotic manipulandum. The results showed that the passive motor experience had an anterograde transfer effect on the subsequent motor execution, whereas no retrograde interference was confirmed in the ABA paradigm experiment. This suggests that the passive experience of the error between visual and proprioceptive sensations leads to the limited but actual compensation of behavior, although it is fragile and cannot be consolidated as a persistent motor memory. © 2014, Frontiers Research Foundation.

As TRAT is still rarely performed in Germany, there are not yet any German reports on acceptance, operation times and complications. Methods: In a pilot study all patients with an indication for hemithyroidectomy without preoperative evidence of malignancies or previous neck surgery and a lobe size < 30 ml, a body mass index (BMI) < 30 and age > 18 years were offered transaxillary robotic-assisted hemithyroidectomy (TRAHT) after a detailed explanation of this operation. The acceptance of this new technique, the operation time, complications and patient satisfaction were prospectively recorded and analyzed. Results: Between January 2013 and October 2014 a total of 65 patients were offered the option of a TRAHT and 21 (32 %) patients opted for this surgical technique. None of these 21 operations had to be converted and there were no intraoperative complications. The median operation time was 190 min (range 106–300 min) with a significant learning curve (first 5 TRAHT 219 min and last 5 TRAHT 163 min), 10 (48 %) patients had a postoperative slight transient skin dysesthesia in the area of the access route, 4 (19 %) patients had a transient recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and 2 patients (9 %) had a transient upper brachial plexus palsy. After the first 21 TRAHT operations, 2 Dunhill operations for Grave’s disease were also performed via a single axillary incision. The operation times were 320 min and 260 min without complications and 21 out of the 23 patients (91 %) were highly satisfied with the cosmetic result and would choose TRAT again. Conclusion: The TRAT procedure still has low acceptance by German patients but patient satisfaction after surgery is high due to the cosmetic result. The extended operation time, new complications (e.g. transient plexus palsy) and a potentially increased rate of transient recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy must be critically considered. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Acceptance; Hemithyroidectomy; Learning curve; Robotic assisted thyroidectomy; Transaxillary robotic surgery",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929439765

The OFS used in computer optical mouse has been adopted for mobile robots because it is not affected by wheel slippage. Vertical height variance is thought to be a dominant factor in systematic error when estimating moving distances in mobile robots driving on uneven surfaces. We propose an approach to mitigate this error by using an afocal (infinite effective focal length) system. We conducted experiments in a linear guide on carpet and three other materials with varying sensor heights from 30 to 50 mm and a moving distance of 80 cm. The same experiments were repeated 10 times. For the proposed afocal OFS module, a 1 mm change in sensor height induces a 0.1% systematic error; for comparison, the error for a conventional fixed-focal-length OFS module is 14.7%. Finally, the proposed afocal OFS module was installed on a mobile robot and tested 10 times on a carpet for distances of 1 m. The average distance estimation error and standard deviation are 0.02% and 17.6%, respectively, whereas those for a conventional OFS module are 4.09% and 25.7%, respectively. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Dead reckoning; Indoor robot localization; Navigation; Optical flow sensor","Ishigami, G., Nagatani, K., Yoshida, K., Path planning for planetary exploration rovers and its evaluation based on wheel slip dynamics.

Most existing hierarchical control techniques handle either strict task priorities by using null-space projectors or a sequence of quadratic programs; or non strict task priorities by using a weighting strategy. This paper proposes a novel approach to handle both strict and non-strict priorities of an arbitrary number of tasks. It can achieve multiple priority rearrangements simultaneously. A generalized projector, which makes it possible to completely project a task into the null-space of a set of tasks, while partially projecting it into the null-space of some other tasks, is developed. This projector can be used to perform priority transitions and task insertion or deletion. The control input is computed by solving one quadratic programming problem, where generalized projectors are adopted to maintain a task hierarchy, and equality or inequality constraints can be implemented. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on a simulated robotic manipulator in a dynamic environment. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Dynamics; Priority switching; Redundant robots; Task hierarchy; Torque-based control",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929447947

J.; How, J. P.","Reinforcement learning (RL) can be a tool for designing policies and controllers for robotic systems. However, the cost of real-world samples remains prohibitive as many RL algorithms require a large number of samples before learning useful policies. Simulators are one way to decrease the number of required real-world samples, but imperfect models make deciding when and how to trust samples from a simulator difficult. We present a framework for efficient RL in a scenario where multiple simulators of a target task are available, each with varying levels of fidelity. The framework is designed to limit the number of samples used in each successively higher-fidelity/cost simulator by allowing a learning agent to choose to run trajectories at the lowest level simulator that will still provide it with useful information. Theoretical proofs of the framework’s sample complexity are given and empirical results are demonstrated on a remote-controlled car with multiple simulators. The approach enables RL algorithms to find near-optimal policies in a physical robot domain with fewer expensive real-world samples than previous transfer approaches or learning without simulators.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929224207

We present a case study on formal verification for a high-level planner/scheduler for the Care-O-bot, an autonomous personal robotic assistant. We describe how a model of the Care-O-bot and its environment was developed using Brahms, a multiagent workflow language. Formal verification was then carried out by automatically translating this model to the input language of an existing model checker. Four sample properties based on system requirements were verified. We then refined the environment model three times to increase its accuracy and the persuasiveness of the formal verification results. The first refinement uses a user activity log based on real-life experiments, but is deterministic. The second refinement uses the activities from the user activity log nondeterministically. The third refinement uses “conjoined activities” based on an observation that many user activities can overlap. The four samples properties were verified for each refinement of the environment model. Finally, we discuss the approach of environment model refinement with respect to this case study.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929208278

Most recent developments show that convolutional deep neural networks are currently the state-of-the-art in terms of classification accuracy. In this article we propose to use of a different type of deep neural network—stacked autoencoders—and show that within a limited number of layers and nodes, for accommodating the use of low-power accelerators such as mobile GPUs and FPGAs, we are still able to achieve both classification levels not far from the state-of-the-art and a high number of processed frames per second. We present experiments using the color CIFAR-10 dataset. This enables the adaptation of the architecture to a live feed camera. Another novelty equally proposed for the first time in this work suggests that the training phase can also be performed in these low-power devices, instead of the usual approach that uses a desktop CPU or a GPU to perform this task and only runs the trained network later on the FPGA. This allows incorporating new functionalities as, for example, a robot performing runtime learning. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Autonomous systems; Deep learning; FPGAs; Low-power; Mobile GPUs; Neural networks; OpenCL; Parallel computing; Stacked autoencoder",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929208788

Less attention has been paid to multiplane undulations, which are particularly important in terrestrial environments where vertical undulations can regulate substrate contact. A seemingly complex mode of snake locomotion, sidewinding, can be described by the superposition of two waves: horizontal and vertical body waves with a phase difference of ±90°. We demonstrate that the high maneuverability displayed by sidewinder rattlesnakes (Crotalus cerastes) emerges from the animal's ability to independently modulate these waves. Sidewinder rattlesnakes used two distinct turning methods, which we term differential turning (26° change in orientation per wave cycle) and reversal turning (89°). Observations of the snakes suggested that during differential turning the animals imposed an amplitude modulation in the horizontal wave whereas in reversal turning they shifted the phase of the vertical wave by 180°. We tested these mechanisms using a multimodule snake robot as a physical model, successfully generating differential and reversal turning with performance comparable to that of the organisms. Further manipulations of the two-wave system revealed a third turning mode, frequency turning, not observed in biological snakes, which produced large (127°) in-place turns. The two-wave system thus functions as a template (a targeted motor pattern) that enables complex behaviors in a high-degree-of-freedom system to emerge from relatively simple modulations to a basic pattern. Our study reveals the utility of templates in understanding the control of biological movement as well as in developing control schemes for limbless robots. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

Motor imagery (MI), the imagination of movements without physical action, presents an alternate neurorehabilitation for stroke patients without relying on residue movements. However, MI is an endogenous mental process that is not physically observable. Recently, advances in brain–computer interface (BCI) technology have enabled the objective detection of MI that spearheaded this alternate neurorehabilitation for stroke. In this review, we present two strategies of using BCI for neurorehabilitation after stroke: detecting MI to trigger a feedback, and detecting MI with a robot to provide concomitant MI and PP. We also present three randomized control trials that employed these two strategies for upper limb rehabilitation. A total of 125 chronic stroke patients were screened over six years. The BCI screening revealed that 103 (82%) patients can use electroencephalogram-based BCI, and 75 (60%) performed well with accuracies above 70%. A total of 67 patients were recruited to complete one of the three RCTs ranging from two to six weeks of which 26 patients, who underwent BCI neurorehabilitation that employed these two strategies, had significant motor improvement of 4.5 measured by Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment of the upper extremity.

The method fuses two types of range measurements: the range from the robot to the beacons measured by ultrasonic sensors and the range from the robot to the walls surrounding the robot measured by a laser range finder (LRF). For the fusion, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is utilized. Because finding the Jacobian matrix is not feasible for range measurement using an LRF, UKF has an advantage in this situation over the extended KF. The locations of the beacons and range data from the beacons are available, whereas the correspondence of the range data to the beacon is not given. Therefore, the proposed method also deals with the problem of data association to determine which beacon corresponds to the given range data. The proposed approach is evaluated using different sets of design parameter values and is compared with the method that uses only an LRF or ultrasonic beacons. Comparative analysis shows that even though ultrasonic beacons are sparsely populated, have a large error and have a slow update rate, they improve the localization performance when fused with the LRF measurement. In addition, proper adjustment of the UKF design parameters is crucial for full utilization of the UKF approach for sensor fusion. This study contributes to the derivation of a UKF-based design methodology to fuse two exteroceptive measurements that are complementary to each other in localization. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Data association; Fusing measurements; Laser range finder; Mobile robot; Ultrasonic beacons; Unscented Kalman filter","Thrun, S., Probabilistic Algorith ms in Robotics (2000) AI Mag, 21, pp. 93-109; Khaleghi, B., Khamis, A., Karray, F.O., Razavi, S.N., Multisensor data fusion: A review of the state-of-the-art (2013) Inf.

This paper proposes a sensor-in-the-loop, non-tracking method for probe-and-drogue style autonomous aerial refueling tasks by combining sensitivity adjustments of a 3D Flash LIDAR camera with computer vision based image-processing techniques. The method overcomes the inherit ambiguity issues when reconstructing 3D information from traditional 2D images by taking advantage of ready to use 3D point cloud data from the camera, followed by well-established computer vision techniques. These techniques include curve fitting algorithms and outlier removal with the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to reliably estimate the drogue center in 3D space, as well as to establish the relative position between the probe and the drogue. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method on a real system, a ground navigation robot was designed and fabricated. Results presented in the paper show that using images acquired from a 3D Flash LIDAR camera as real time visual feedback, the ground robot is able to track a moving simulated drogue and continuously narrow the gap between the robot and the target autonomously. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","3D Flash LIDAR; Autonomous aerial refueling; Computer vision; Markerless; Probe and drogue; UAV","Mao, W., Eke, F.O., A Survey of the Dynamics and Control of Aircraft during Aerial Refueling (2008) Nonlinear Dyn.

In particular, although simple artificial self-replicating systems including wooden blocks, magnetic systems, modular robots and synthetic molecular systems have been devised, such kinematic self-replicators are rare compared with examples of theoretical cellular self-replication. One of the principal reasons for this is the amount of complexity that arises when you try to incorporate self-replication into a physical medium. In this regard, DNA is a prime candidate material for constructing self-replicating systems due to its ability to self-assemble through molecular recognition. Here, we show that DNA T-motifs, which self-assemble into ring structures, can be designed to self-replicate through toehold-mediated strand displacement reactions. The inherent design of these rings allows the population dynamics of the systems to be controlled. We also analyse the replication scheme within a universal framework of self-replication and derive a quantitative metric of the self-replicability of the rings. © 2015 Nature Publishing Group",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929258109

Upper endoscopy was performed showing prominent folds in the gastric mucosa and stenosis at the antrum–pylorus.

Pure position control is unsuitable for such tasks because even small errors in the desired trajectory can cause significant deviations from the desired forces and torques. The proposed algorithm takes a reference Cartesian trajectory and force/torque profile as input and adapts the movement so that the resulting forces and torques match the reference profiles. The learning algorithm is based on dynamic movement primitives and quaternion representation of orientation, which provide a mathematical machinery for efficient and stable adaptation. Experimentally we show that the robot’s performance can be significantly improved within a few iteration steps, compensating for vision and other errors that might arise during the execution of the task. We also show that our methodology is suitable both for robots with admittance and for robots with impedance control. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Manipulation and compliant assembly; Physical human-robot interaction; Programming by demonstration; Skill learning and adaptation",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929095701

In this paper, PSO-UFastSLAM based on the unscented-FastSLAM (UFastSLAM) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. The UFastSLAM combines unscented particle filter (UPF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to estimate the robot poses and features. Furthermore, to prevent the particles degeneracy and impoverishment, PSO is adapted to optimize particles. The proposed method is applied on our own research platform, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), through sea trials in Tuandao Bay.

Our work contributes an effective solution to two important problems that have been disregarded so far: First, obstacles in the environment (walls, furniture,...) do affect the gas spatial distribution. Second, when combining odor measurements taken at different instants of time, their ‘ages’ must be taken into account to model the ephemeral nature of gas distributions. In order to incorporate these two characteristics into the mapping process we propose modeling the spatial distribution of gases as a Gaussian Markov random field. This mathematical framework allows us to consider both: (i) the vanishing information of gas readings by means of a time-increasing uncertainty in sensor measurements, and (ii) the influence of objects in the environment by means of correlations among the different areas. Experimental validation is provided with both, simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating the out-performance of our method when compared to previous standard techniques in gas mapping. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Gas distribution mapping; Gaussian Markov random field; Mobile robotics; Robotics olfaction",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929094509

However, for micro-robots, these methods in general are only applicable for moving and drilling operations, but not for the undertaking of various missions. In this paper, we propose a new micro-robot concept, which uses wireless power transfer to deliver the propulsion force and electric power simultaneously.

Theoretically, it is known that for linear system, the minimum variance is achieved using the best linear unbiased estimator in one-stage estimation. However, the two-stage estimation can also achieve the minimum variance under certain conditions. In this paper, the statistical properties of both are explored in detail under a newly established mathematical fact. The result can be extended to the nonlinear estimation problem via approximation.

Motion capture systems have been developed to accomplish this, and marker-based motion capture systems, in particular, have been used in measuring human actions and performing action recognition. However, marker-based motion capture systems have several drawbacks; in particular, the capture system is expensive, intrusive, and complex to use. Markerless motion capture systems have the potential to overcome these drawbacks. Recently, databases containing a large number of configurations of human whole body actions are available, and they are expected to be reused as new approaches to recognizing actions and recovering action configurations from motion depicted in videos comprising monocular images. This paper describes a design of an action database that consists of action configurations, pose descriptors from silhouette images, a stochastic model encoding each sequence of the pose descriptors, and relations between the data and the stochastic models. The proposed action database is applied to recognizing a video containing a performer doing a specific action and to recovering all the joint angles from the video. We tested the action database on recognition and configuration recovery, and the results show that the database is suitable for this purpose. © 2015 The Author(s).

An end-to-end workflow was developed to measure patient-specific motion-induced uncertainties in imaging, treatment planning, and radiation delivery with respiratory motion phantoms and dosimeters. A custom torso phantom with inserts mimicking normal lung tissue and lung lesion was filled with [18F]FDG. The lung lesion insert was driven by six different patient-specific respiratory patterns or kept stationary. PET/CT images were acquired under motionless ground truth, tidal breathing motion-averaged (3D), and respiratory phase-correlated (4D) conditions. Target volumes were estimated by standardized uptake value (SUV) thresholds that accurately defined the ground-truth lesion volume. Non-uniform dose-painting plans using volumetrically modulated arc therapy were optimized for fixed normal lung and spinal cord objectives and variable PET-based target objectives. Resulting plans were delivered to a cylindrical diode array at rest, in motion on a platform driven by the same respiratory patterns (3D), or motion-compensated by a robotic couch with an infrared camera tracking system (4D). Errors were estimated relative to the static ground truth condition for mean target-to-background (T/B<inf>mean</inf>) ratios, target volumes, planned equivalent uniform target doses, and 2%-2 mm gamma delivery passing rates. Relative to motionless ground truth conditions, PET/CT imaging errors were on the order of 10-20%, treatment planning errors were 5-10%, and treatment delivery errors were 5-30% without motion compensation. Errors from residual motion following compensation methods were reduced to 5-10% in PET/CT imaging,<5% in treatment planning, and<2% in treatment delivery. We have demonstrated that estimation of respiratory motion uncertainty and its propagation from PET/CT imaging to RT planning, and RT delivery under a dose painting paradigm is feasible within an integrated respiratory motion phantom workflow. For a limited set of cases, the magnitude of errors was comparable during PET/CT imaging and treatment delivery without motion compensation. Errors were moderately mitigated during PET/CT imaging and significantly mitigated during RT delivery with motion compensation. This dynamic motion phantom end-to-end workflow provides a method for quality assurance of 4D PET/CT-guided radiotherapy, including evaluation of respiratory motion compensation methods during imaging and treatment delivery. © 2015 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","dose painting; IGRT; PET/CT; respiratory motion; robotic couch tracking; VMAT","Aerts, H.J., Bussink, J., Oyen, W.J., Van Elmpt, W., Folgering, A.M., Emans, D., Velders, M., De Ruysscher, D., Identification of residual metabolic-active areas within NSCLC tumours using a pre-radiotherapy FDG-PET-CT scan: A prospective validation (2012) Lung Cancer, 75, pp. 73-76; Aristophanous, M., Berbeco, R.I., Killoran, J.H., Yap, J.T., Sher, D.J., Allen, A.M., Larson, E., Chen, A.B., Clinical utility of 4D FDG-PET/CT scans in radiation treatment planning (2012) Int.

While these methods are usually developed for a specific probe, they are in principle easily adapted to other probes. In practice, however, the adaptation often proves tedious and this is impractical in a research setting, where new probes are tested regularly. Therefore, we developed a method which can be applied to a large variety of probes without adaptation. The method used a robot arm to move a plastic sphere submerged in water through the ultrasound image plane, providing a slow and precise movement. The sphere was then segmented from the recorded ultrasound images using a MATLAB programme and the calibration matrix was computed based on this segmentation in combination with tracking information. The method was tested on three very different probes demonstrating both great versatility and high accuracy. © 2015 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","3D ultrasound; image-guided surgery; position tracking; probe calibration; ultrasound imaging","Askeland, C., Lindseth, F., Solberg, O.V., Bakeng, J.B.L., Tangen, G.A., CustusX: A research application for image-guided therapy (2011) MIDAS J.

Humans and robots have complementary skills. The robotic worker can relieve the human from repetitive work, and the human can make robot deployment easier by managing nonstandard or particularly skilful operations. Such a scenario, however, requires new safety systems to preserve human workers from potential danger and at the same time to make human–robot interaction productive and advantageous. In this paper, a system for safe and task consistent human–robot interaction integrated with an industrial controller is proposed. The robot executes evasive motions to avoid impacts with obstacles consistently with the task. A classification of constraints constituting the task is proposed and a safety strategy based on such classification is defined.

Unlike previous formation structures such as virtual-leader and actual-leader structures with position allocation including a rigid allocation and an optimization based allocation, the formation employing the proposed MLC structure and CPA algorithm is robust against the fault (or disappearance) of the member robots and reduces the entire cost. In the MLC structure, a leader of the entire system is chosen among leader candidate robots. The CPA algorithm is the decentralized position allocation algorithm that assigns the robots to the vertex of the formation via the competition of the adjacent robots. The numerical simulations and experimental results are included to show the feasibility and the performance of the multiple robot system employing the proposed MLC structure and the CPA algorithm. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Competitive position allocation algorithm; Formation control; Multiple leader candidate structure; Robust formation","Chaimowicz, L., Kumar, V., Campos, M., Paradigm for dynamic coordination of multiple robots (2004) Auton.

Robots need to represent and reason with incomplete domain knowledge, acquiring and using sensor inputs based on need and availability. This paper presents an architecture that exploits the complementary strengths of declarative programming and probabilistic graphical models as a step toward addressing these challenges. Answer Set Prolog (ASP), a declarative language, is used to represent, and perform inference with, incomplete domain knowledge, including default information that holds in all but a few exceptional situations. A hierarchy of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) probabilistically models the uncertainty in sensor input processing and navigation. Nonmonotonic logical inference in ASP is used to generate a multinomial prior for probabilistic state estimation with the hierarchy of POMDPs. It is also used with historical data to construct a beta (meta) density model of priors for metareasoning and early termination of trials when appropriate. Robots equipped with this architecture automatically tailor sensor input processing and navigation to tasks at hand, revising existing knowledge using information extracted from sensor inputs. The architecture is empirically evaluated in simulation and on a mobile robot visually localizing objects in indoor domains.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928963545

In this study, an adaptive hidden Markov model (HMM)-based gesture recognition method with user adaptation (UA) using the Kinect camera to simplify large-scale video processing is designed to be the NUI of a humanoid robot device. The popular Kinect camera is employed for acquiring the gesture signals made by the active user, and the gesture action from the user can then be recognized and used to be as the control command for driving the humanoid robot to imitate the user’s actions. The large-scale video data can be reduced by the Kinect camera where the data from the Kinect camera for representing gesture signals includes the depth measurement information, and therefore only simple 3-axis coordinate information of the joints in a human skeleton is analyzed, categorized and managed in the developed system. By the presented scheme, the humanoid robot will imitate the human active gesture according to the content of the received gesture command. The well-known HMM pattern recognition method with the support of the Kinect device is explored to classify the human’s active gestures where a user adaptation scheme of MAP+GoSSRT that enhances MAP by incorporating group of states shifted by referenced transfer (GoSSRT) is proposed for adjusting HMM parameters, which will further increase the recognition accuracy of HMM gesture recognition. Human gesture recognition experiments for controlling the activity of the humanoid robot were performed on the indicated 14 classes of human active gestures. Experimental results demonstrated the superiority of the NUI by presented HMM gesture recognition with user adaptation for humanoid robot imitation applications. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Gesture recognition; Hidden Markov model; Humanoid robot; Kinect; User adaptation",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928745771

While robots robustly perform in controlled environment like factories, humans still significantly outperform robots in unconstrained environments. This is particularly true when it comes grasping. Human grasping is faster and tremendously more robust, especially in the presence of significant uncertainty. We aim at improving this situation and propose two major building blocks. Firstly, we consider how to effectively use the mobility of the robot base. Secondly, we show an approach to effectively handle grasping uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a general system architecture for mobile manipulators to execute grasping tasks. This architecture allows a mobile manipulator to employ arm-base coordinated motions during grasping. The architecture also supports the active handling of uncertainty by means of adaptive grasp strategies. To purposefully handle uncertainty we propose two versatile grasping strategies. Small uncertainty can be directly handled by a rapid grabbing strategy, while large uncertainty can be handled by means of pre-grasp manipulation. The targeted selection of the strategy for a specific case takes both grasp success probability and execution time into consideration. We evaluate our approach on a real robot to show that our approach is feasible in real applications, and that it outperforms a traditional grasping procedure. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Arm-base coordination; Grasping under uncertainty; Mobile manipulation",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928750477

We name the algorithm Weighted Shortest Path Algorithm, by which images can be stitched automatically. Matching Mean Square Error is introduced as the weight of edges on the graph, which is intuitive and easy to compute. Furthermore, the optimized Dijkstra algorithm is applied to speed up the path finding algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm causes less Matching Mean Square Error and obtains more stable results than other similar methods.

Methods: This technique offers a safe, reliable, and reproducible way of obtaining correct implant positioning in patello-femoral arthroplasty, and as a result, reduces revision surgery due to implant malalignment. We evaluated 30 knees in 29 patients who underwent robotically assisted patello-femoral arthroplasty between June 2009 and May 2011. Mean follow-up was 15.9 months. This was a retrospective study that involved chart reviews and radiographic analysis. Radiographic analysis included pre-operative and postoperative plain films for implant positioning. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), range of motion, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) patient activity-level ratings, visual analog pain scale (VAS), and the Knee Society Score (KSS). Results: The patients had an average OKS of 21.7 pre-operatively and reached an average of 33.5 postoperatively (p = 0.0033). Pre-operative UCLA patient activity-level ratings was 3.1, compared with 4.8 postoperatively. Average VAS pre-operatively was 8 and postoperatively it decreased to 2.1 (p = 0.0033). The average KSS final score pre-operatively was 56 and postoperatively it increased to 68.3 while the functional score pre-operatively was 47.2 compared to 68.1 postoperatively (p = 0.011). As a result, patello-femoral arthroplasty is an emerging knee resurfacing technique that is an alternative to the total knee arthroplasty. Conclusions: The early retrospective data for robotically-assisted PFA show encouraging results.

Delivering exercises at a participant's desired difficulty has the potential to improve both motor learning and users' engagement in therapy. Motivation and engagement are among the contributing factors to the success of exercise programs. The authors previously demonstrated that error amplification can be used to introduce levels of challenge into a robotic reaching task, and that machine-learning algorithms can dynamically adjust difficulty to the desired level with 85% accuracy. Building on these findings, we present the results of a proof-of-concept study investigating the impacts of practicing under desirable difficulty conditions. A control condition with a predefined random order for difficulty levels was deemed more suitable for this study (compared to constant or continuously increasing difficulty). By practicing the task at their desirable difficulties, participants in the experimental group perceived their performance at a significantly higher level and reported lower required effort to complete the task, in comparison to a control group. Moreover, based on self-reports, participants in the experimental group were willing, on average, to continue the training session for 4.6 more training blocks (∼45 min) compared to the control group's average. This study demonstrates the efficiency of delivering the exercises at the user's desired difficulty level to improve the user's engagement in exercise tasks.

This work posits that the agent may receive individual reinforcements out of order, which is a relaxation of an important assumption in previous works from the literature. To that end, a stochastic time delay is introduced into a mobile robot line-following application. The main contribution of this work is to provide a novel stochastic approximation algorithm, which is an extension of Q-learning, for the time-delayed reinforcement problem. The paper includes a proof of convergence as well as grid world simulation results from MATLAB, results of line-following simulations within the Cyberbotics Webots mobile robot simulator, and finally, experimental results using an e-Puck mobile robot to follow a real track despite the presence of large, stochastic time delays in its reinforcement signal. © 2015 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada","Delayed reinforcement; Jitter; Markov decision process; Multiple models; Reinforcement learning; Stochastic time delay",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928785640

In a single round, each robot may be allowed to visit only one event (matching dispatch), or several events in a sequence (sequence dispatch). In a distributed setting, each event is discovered by a sensor and reported to a robot. Here, we present novel algorithms aimed at overcoming the shortcomings of several existing solutions. We propose pairwise distance based matching algorithm (PDM) to eliminate long edges by pairwise exchanges between matching pairs. Our sequence dispatch algorithm (SQD) iteratively finds the closest event-robot pair, includes the event in dispatch schedule of the selected robot and updates its position accordingly. When event-robot distances are multiplied by robot resistance (inverse of the remaining energy), the corresponding energy-balanced variants are obtained. We also present generalizations which handle multiple visits and timing constraints. Our localized algorithm MAD is based on information mesh infrastructure and local auctions within the robot network for obtaining the optimal dispatch schedule for each robot. The simulations conducted confirm the advantages of our algorithms over other existing solutions in terms of average robot-event distance and lifetime. © 2014 IEEE.","centralized and distributed algorithm; energy efficiency; matching; Robot coordination; sequence dispatch; wireless sensor networks","Lukic, M., Stojmenovic, I., Energy-balanced matching and sequence dispatch of robots to events: Pairwise exchanges and sensor assisted robot coordination (2013) Proc. 10th IEEE Int.

In these applications, the robots are expected to perform a range of natural body motions, which can be either preprogrammed or learnt from human demonstration. This paper proposes a strategy for imitating dynamic walking gait for a humanoid robot by formulating the problem as an optimization process. The human motion data are recorded with an inertial sensor-based motion tracking system (Biomotion+). Joint angle trajectories are obtained from the transformation of the estimated posture. Key locomotion frames corresponding to gait events are chosen from the trajectories. Due to differences in joint structures of the human and robot, the joint angles at these frames need to be optimized to satisfy the physical constraints of the robot while preserving robot stability. Interpolation among the optimized angles is needed to generate continuous angle trajectories. The method is validated using a NAO humanoid robot, with results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for dynamic walking. © 2015 IEEE.

The main idea is to correct a preplanned path through an iterative learning control (ILC) method. Instead of seeking the conventional ILC strategy, an iterative learning identification method, which is called calibration-based ILC, is developed to identify the robot kinematic parameters along the path in a local working zone. To facilitate calibration-based ILC, we propose two objectives. The first objective is to find the exact values of robot kinematic parameters based on the ILC scheme. The second objective is to search the fastest learning convergence speed and robustness in the iterative domain. Based on the identification of robot kinematic parameters, we then propose an algorithm for the accurate path tracking of industrial robots. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the performance of path tracking can be improved significantly via the proposed method. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","ILC; path correction; path tracking; robot calibration; Visual servoing","Campbell, F.C., (2006) Manufacturing Technology for Aerospace Structural Materials, pp. 495-537. , New York, NY, USA: Elsevier; Monsarrat, B., High performance robotized assembly system for Challenger 300 business jet nose fuse panels Proc.

However, disturbances, arising from movement from station to station, significantly deteriorate the positioning accuracy. This paper proposes a novel in-process robot base frame calibration method with a 2D vision system. A proposal layout of flight control surface assembly, the developed mobile robotic drilling system, and the 2D vision system are first introduced. Then an iterative measurement scheme is proposed to eliminate measurement errors induced by non-perpendicularity and erroneous object distance during 2D vision-based positioning of preset reference holes. In order to obtain the third-dimension Cartesian coordinates of the reference holes, depth control with autofocus is achieved by using a new sharpness function. Based on the acquired Cartesian coordinates of the reference holes in the robot base frame, and their counterparts measured in advance in the world coordinate system, the description of the robot base frame with respect to the world coordinate system can be obtained with least-squares fitting. Numerical experiments show that depth control with autofocus contributes to enhanced accuracy of robot base frame calibration. Experiments performed on the developed mobile drilling system indicate that the maximum positioning error is about 0.6 mm with the proposed calibration method. Since position errors of drilled fastener holes will be further measured and compensated for based on the 2D vision system, the proposed in-process robot base frame calibration method is effective. © 2015 Springer-Verlag London","2D vision system; Depth control with autofocus; Iterative measurement; Least-squares fitting; Mobile robotic drilling; Robot base frame calibration",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928682048

P.","The formulation of an integral suboptimal second-order sliding mode ((ISSOSM) control algorithm, oriented to solve motion control problems for robot manipulators, is presented in this paper. The proposed algorithm is designed so that the so-called reaching phase, normally present in the evolution of a system controlled via the sliding mode approach, is reduced to a minimum. This fact makes the algorithm more suitable to be applied to a real industrial robot, since it enhances its robustness, by extending it also to time intervals during which the classical sliding mode is not enforced. Moreover, since the algorithm generates second-order sliding modes, while the model of the controlled electromechanical system has a relative degree equal to one, the control action actually fed into the plant is continuous, which provides a positive chattering alleviation effect. The assessment of the proposal has been carried out by experimentally testing it on a COMAU SMART3-S2 anthropomorphic industrial robot manipulator. The satisfactory experimental results, also compared with those obtained with a standard proportional-derivative controller and with the original suboptimal algorithm, confirm that the new algorithm can actually be used in an industrial context.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928978953

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical quality function deployment (QFD) framework that enables one to set R&D priorities and then develop corresponding business models to meet future societal needs. The proposed QFD framework consists of a hierarchical structure with three house-of-quality (HOQ) stages, which are based on patent analysis and opinions of specialists and generalists. Based on the results of the HOQ and the convergence of iterated correlation analysis, prospective technology was identified. We applied the proposed framework to robotics technology in Korea and found that, for robotics R&D, position sensors are the most important emerging technologies, followed by distance sensors and motor-driven technologies. In addition, by utilizing reverse QFD, we suggest business models for cleaning, entertainment, and pet robots.

Electrical stimuli can be generated by the machine system and delivered to the animal's brain to control its behavior. The sensory capacity and flexible motion ability of rat robots highlight their potential advantages over mechanical robots. However, most existing rat robots require that a human observes the environmental layout to guide navigation, which limits the applications of rat robots. This work incorporates object detection algorithms to a rat robot system to enable it to find 'human-interesting' objects, and then use these cues to guide its behaviors to perform automatic navigation. A miniature camera is mounted on the rat's back to capture the scene in front of the rat. The video is transferred via a wireless module to a computer and we develop some object detection/identification algorithms to allow objects of interest to be found. Next, we make the rat robot perform a specific motion automatically in response to a detected object, such as turning left. A single stimulus does not allow the rat to perform a motion successfully. Inspired by the fact that humans usually give a series of stimuli to a rat robot, we develop a closed-loop model that issues a stimulus sequence automatically according to the state of the rat and the objects in front of it until the rat completes the motion successfully. Thus, the rat robot, which we refer to as a rat cyborg, is able to move according to the detected objects without the need for manual operations. The object detection methods and the closed-loop stimulation model are evaluated in experiments, which demonstrate that our rat cyborg can accomplish human-specified navigation automatically. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",,"Bin, G., Gao, X., Wang, Y., Hong, B., Gao, S., VEP-based brain-computer interfaces: Time, frequency, and code modulations [research frontier] (2009) IEEE Comput.

For motion pattern recognition, many features of multi-channel EMG signals were investigated, but the relationships between muscles were not considered. In this study, a novel STFT-ranking feature based on short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is proposed. The novelty of STFT-ranking features is considering and covering the relationship information between EMG signals and multiple muscles in a motion pattern. With an exoskeleton robot arm, two series of motion patterns corresponding to the shoulder and elbow in the sagittal plane were investigated. EMG signals from six muscles were acquired in arm motion patterns when participants worn the robot arm. Four types of feature combinations, including seven conventional features, were compared with the STFT-ranking feature. The principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to build the motion recognition model. With the STFT-ranking feature, the recognition performance (93.9%) is superior to the conventional features (33.3-90.8%). The recognition variation is smaller (SD = 4.3%) than the other features tested (SD = 5.9-13.8%). These achievements will contribute to the advancement of control method of exoskeleton robots or power orthoses based on multi-channel EMG signals in the future. Based on the principle of STFT-ranking feature, the method also has potential for other multi-channel signal applications, such as electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing, speech recognition, and acoustic analysis. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Electromyography;

The system aims to synthesize the knowledge on humanoid whole body motions learned during teacher-supported interactions, and apply this knowledge during different physical interactions between a robot and its surroundings. The phase transfer sequence represents the temporal order of the changing points in multiple time sequences. It encodes the dynamical aspects of the sequences so as to absorb the gaps in timing and amplitude derived from interaction changes. The phase transfer sequence was evaluated in reinforcement learning of sitting-up and walking motions conducted by a real humanoid robot and compatible simulator. In both tasks, the robotic motions were less dependent on physical interactions when learned by the proposed feature than by conventional similarity measurements. Phase transfer sequence also enhanced the convergence speed of motion learning. Our proposed feature is original primarily because it absorbs the gaps caused by changes of the originally acquired physical interactions, thereby enhancing the learning speed in subsequent interactions. © 2012 IEEE.","Change detection; dimensionality reduction; learning from demonstration (LfD); physical human-robot interaction.","Zelazo, P.R., Zelazo, N.A., Kolb, S., Walking' in the newborn (1972) Science, 176 (4032), pp. 314-315; Ulrich, D.A., Ulrich, B.D., Angulo-Kinzler, R.M., Yun, J., Treadmill training of infants with down syndrome: Evidence-based developmental outcomes (2001) Pediatrics, 108 (5), pp. e84-e84; Ijspeert, A., Nakanishi, J., Schaal, S., Learning attractor landscapes for learning motor primitives (2002) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 15, pp. 1523-1530. , Cambridge, MA, USA MIT Press; Nakanishi, J., Morimoto, J., Endo, G., Cheng, G., Schaal, S., Kawato, M., Learning from demonstration and adaptation of biped locomotion (2004) Robot.

Based on this analysis, a new concept called the “lucid workspace” is introduced. Definition of such an area in the robot workspace is useful in vision system design. It enables us to know a priori the area that the robot can see in a crystal clear manner, so the designer can select the specifications and relative position of the vision system cameras to cover the needs. First, the basic two-camera triangulation equations are used to calculate a 3D object position, error propagation equations are derived by taking the appropriate partial derivatives with respect to all measurement errors. Next, using the applicable assumptions, two theorems are obtained and a new algorithm for determination of the lucid workspace is presented by using them. The performance of the new algorithm is verified using Monte Carlo simulations. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Angles-only cameras; Monte Carlo simulation; Robot vision; Stereo vision; Triangulation","Kriegman, D.J., Triendl, E., Binford, T.O., Stereo Vision and Navigation in Buildings for Mobile Robots (1989) IEEE Transaction on Robotics and Automation, 5 (6), pp. 792-793; Lee, J.S., Lim, J., Bien, Z., Simple Stereo Algorithm for 3D Positioning of Object Points (1988) Electron.

The game is adversarial, with multiple, potentially competing, objectives. This interplay among different factors makes the problem complex, even in the case of only two players. To make analysis tractable, previous approaches often make various limiting assumptions upon player actions. In this paper, we present a framework for analyzing and solving a two-player capture-the-flag game as a zero-sum differential game. Our problem formulation allows each player to make decisions rationally according to the current player positions, assuming only an upper bound on the movement speeds. Using numerical solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations, we compute winning regions for each player as subsets of the joint configuration space and derive the corresponding winning strategies. The computational method and simulations are presented, along with experiments with human agents in the Berkeley autonomy and robotics in capture-the-flag testbed. These experiments demonstrate the use of the solutions in realistic conditions and highlight their potential applications in automation-aided decision making for humans and mixed human-robot teams. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Capture-the-flag; differential game; human-robot teams; reachability analysis","Huang, H., Ding, J., Zhang, W., Tomlin, C., A differential game approach to planning in adversarial scenarios: A case study on capture-the-flag Proc.

In the proposed algorithm, the map is described by grids in which nodes are defined on corners of grids. The planning algorithm considers the map as four areas, namely, implementation, observation, explored, and unknown. The Implementation area is a subset of the Observation area, whereas the Explored area is the union of all the previous Observation areas. The path is planned with a receding horizon planning strategy to generate waypoints and in-between map updates. When a new map update occurs, the path is replanned within the current Observation area if necessary. If no such path exists, the search is extended to the Explored area. Paths can be planned by recursively searching available nodes inside the Explored area that can be connected to available nodes on the boundary of the Explored area. A robot platform is employed to conduct a series of experiments in a laboratory environment to verify the proposed path planning algorithm. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","non-uniform environment; path planning; Receding horizon planning; recursive searching; unmanned robot","Lu, Y., Huo, X., Arslan, P., Tsiotras, P., Incremental multi-scale search algorithm for dynamic path planning with low worst-case complexity (2011) IEEE Trans.

(2012) to solve the problem of decoupling the rotational velocities around x and y axes of camera frame in robotic visual servoing systems. Based on these two image features and the other four image features used in previous work Chaumette (IEEE Trans. Robot. 20(4):713–723 2004), the interaction matrix has a maximal decoupled structure and thus the singularity of interaction matrix is avoided in Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS). The analytical form of depth is given by using classical geometrical primitives and image moment invariants. The IBVS Proportional Derivative (PD) controller is then designed and the stability of the controller is proved by using Lyapunov method. The tracking performance is thus enhanced for a 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic system. Experimental results on the robotic system are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","IBVS; Image moment invariants; Interaction matrix; Neural network; Robotic systems","Zhao, Y.M., Xie, W.F., Wang, T.T., Neural network-based image moments for visual servoing of planar objects (2012) Proceedings of ASME/IEEE Int.

Basic knowledge about its impact on motor system oscillations and functional connectivity is however scarce. Specifically, a direct comparison between different feedback modalities and their neural signatures is missing.We assessed a neurofeedback training intervention of modulating β-activity in circumscribed sensorimotor regions by kinesthetic motor imagery (MI). Right-handed healthy participants received two different feedback modalities contingent to their MI-associated brain activity in a cross-over design: (I) visual feedback with a brain-computer interface (BCI) and (II) proprioceptive feedback with a brain-robot interface (BRI) orthosis attached to the right hand. High-density electroencephalography was used to examine the reactivity of the cortical motor system during the training session of each task by studying both local oscillatory power entrainment and distributed functional connectivity.Both feedback modalities activated a distributed functional connectivity network of coherent oscillations. A significantly higher skill and lower variability of self-controlled sensorimotor β-band modulation could, however, be achieved in the BRI condition. This gain in controlling regional motor oscillations was accompanied by functional coupling of remote β-band and θ-band activity in bilateral fronto-central regions and left parieto-occipital regions, respectively. The functional coupling of coherent θ-band oscillations correlated moreover with the skill of regional β-modulation thus revealing a motor learning related network.Our findings indicate that proprioceptive feedback is more suitable than visual feedback to entrain the motor network architecture during the interplay between motor imagery and feedback processing thus resulting in better volitional control of regional brain activity. © 2015 .","Beta rhythms; Brain self-regulation; Brain-computer interface; Brain-machine interface; Brain-robot interface; Functional connectivity; Haptic feedback; Neurorehabilitation; Proprioceptive feedback; Theta rhythms","Andersen, R.A., Snyder, L.H., Bradley, D.C., Xing, J., Multimodal representation of space in the posterior parietal cortex and its use in planning movements (1997) Annu.

Previous works on this subject have provided an optimal synthesis for the case in which the FOV is limited in the horizontal directions (H-FOV, i.e., left and right boundaries). In this paper we study the complementary case in which the FOV is limited only in the vertical direction (V-FOV, i.e., upper and lower boundaries). With respect to the H-FOV case, the vertical limitation is all but a simple extension. Indeed, not only the geometry of extremal arcs is different, but also a more complex structure of the synthesis is revealed by analysis. We will indeed show that there exist initial configurations for which the optimal path does not exist. In such cases, we provide an ε-optimal path whose length approximates arbitrarily well any other shorter path. Finally, we provide a partition of the motion plane in regions such that the optimal or ε-optimal path from each point in that region is univocally determined. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Autonomous robots; optimal control; path planning synthesis; visual servo control","Hayet, J.-B., Shortest length paths for a differential drive robot keeping a set of landmarks in sight (2012) J.

As a critical component of the capsule endoscopic examination, physicians need to keep track of the 3D trajectory that the capsule has traveled inside the lower abdomen to identify the positions of the intestinal abnormalities after they are found by the video source. However, existing commercially available radio frequency (RF)-based localization systems can only provide inaccurate and discontinuous position estimation of the WCE due to nonhomogeneity of body tissues and highly complicated distribution of the intestinal tube. In this paper, we present a hybrid localization technique, which takes advantage of data fusion of multiple sensors inside the WCE, to enhance the positioning accuracy and construct the 3-D trajectory of the WCE. The proposed hybrid technique extracts motion information of the WCE from the image sequences captured by the capsule's embedded visual sensor and combines it with the RF signal emitted by the wireless capsule, to simultaneously localize the WCE and mapping the path traveled by the WCE. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid algorithm is able to reduce the average localization error from 6.8 cm to <2.3 cm of the existing RF localization systems and a 3-D map can be precisely constructed to represent the position of the WCE inside small intestine. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","data fusion; hybrid RF localization; micro-robot positioning; motion tracking; Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE)","Pahlavan, K., Li, X., Makela, J.-P., Indoor geolocation science and technology (2002) IEEE Commun.

By exploiting the unique properties of these alloys, a compact, silent and modular actuation system is implemented and integrated in a lightweight and anthropomorphic rapid-prototyped hand chassis. A tendon-driven underactuated mechanism provides the necessary dexterity while keeping the mechanical and control complexity of the device low. Tactile sensors are integrated in the fingertips improving the overall hand control. Embedded custom-made electronics for hand interfacing and control are also presented and analyzed. For the position control of each digit, a novel resistance feedback control scheme is devised and implemented. The functionality and performance of the developed hand is demonstrated in grasp experiments with common objects.When compared to the current most advanced commercial devices, the technology applied in this prototype provides a series of improvements in terms of size, weight, and noise, which will enable upper limb amputees to carry out their basic daily tasks more comfortably. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Multifingered hands; Resistance feedback control; Shape memory alloys; Smart actuators; Underactuated robots; Upper limb prosthetics","Rosa, A.D.L., Walker, G.R.L., Goldsmith, J.B., Elias, J.H., Godden, M.P., Greenhill, R.M.: Robotic hand.

Since then, PF has become very popular because of its ability to process observations represented by nonlinear state-space models where the noises of the model can be non-Gaussian. This methodology has been adopted in various fields, including finance, geophysical systems, wireless communications, control, navigation and tracking, and robotics [2]. The popularity of PF has also spurred the publication of several review articles [2]-[6]. © 1991-2012 IEEE.",,"Gordon, N., Salmond, D., Smith, A., Novel approach to nonlinear/non-Gaussian Bayesian state estimation (1993) IEE Proc., F Radar Signal Process., 140 (2), pp. 107-113; Doucet, A., Johansen, A.M., A tutorial on particle filtering and smoothing: Fifteen years later (2011) Handbook of Nonlinear Filtering, pp. 656-704. , E.

Until recently, minefields remained analog, static, and fixed. But technological development and changes in the nature of war have made remote and autonomous violence increasingly mobile, dynamic, and robotic and, rather than being contained in a bounded Cartesian plane, diffused through the very spaces and flows that sustain civilian life. Such ""unmanned"" weapons are increasingly able to navigate, communicate with each other, identify targets and even kill with minimal human involvement. Mirroring broader changes in the spatial configurations of war, the architectural form of remote and autonomous killing is thus shifting from the two-dimensional minefield to multi-dimensional minespace. This poses challenges to those engaged in humanitarian efforts to demilitarize space. To illustrate these changes, the paper draws on Derek Gregory's notion of ""Everywhere War"" and engages in a discursive ""archeology"" of the minefield as described by US Army mine, booby trap and IED warfare field manuals. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Architecture; Battlespace; Critical security studies; Disarmament; Drones; IEDs; Killer robots; Landmines; War","(2014) AOAV launches anti-suicide bomb film, , https://aoav.org.uk/2014/aoav-launches-anti-suicide-bomb-film/, 21 May, Accessed 09.11.14; Agamben, G., (2005) State of exception, , Kevin Attell (Trans.), University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois, USA; Amoore, L., Biometric borders: governing mobilities in the war on terror (2006) Political Geography, 25 (3), pp. 336-351; Amoore, L., Algorithmic war: everyday geographies of the war on terror (2009) Antipode, 41 (1), pp. 49-69; Ansorge, J.T., Spirits of war: a field manual (2010) International Political Sociology, 4 (4), pp. 362-379; Asaro, P., (2011) Robots as Media, , http://www.peterasaro.org/courses/2011Robots.html, Accessed 04.07.13; Asaro, P., On banning autonomous weapon systems: human rights, automation, and the dehumanization of lethal decision-making (2012) International Review of the Red Cross, 94 (886), pp. 687-709; Asaro, P., The labor of surveillance and bureaucratized killing: new subjectivities of military drone operators (2013) Social Semiotics, 23 (2), pp. 196-224; Axe, D., (2013) Army releases the kraken to protect foreign fire bases; 'I'd like to see the Taliban try to attack this place', , http://breakingdefense.com/2013/04/29/army-releases-the-kraken-to-protect-foreign-fire-bases-id-lik/, Breaking Defense, 29 April, Accessed 04.07.13; Balan, N., (2013) Society's infrastructures must be defended - On sapper epistemology and epidemiological conceptions of contemporary warfare, , http://architectureofwar.artun.ee/documentation/, Paper presented at ""Between Architecture of War and Military Urbanism Conference"" in Tallinn, Estonia, Accessed 04.07.13; Bernardi, D.L., Cheong, P.H., Lundy, C., Ruston, S.W., (2012) Narrative Landmines: Rumors, Islamist Extremism and the struggle for strategic Influence, , Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA; Blackmore, T., (2005) War X: Human extensions in battlespace, , University of Toronto Press, Toronto, Canada; Blain, L., (2010) South Korea's autonomous robot gun turrets: Deadly from kilometers away, , http://www.gizmag.com/korea-dodamm-super-aegis-autonomos-robot-gun-turret/17198/, gizmag, 7 December, Accessed 04.07.13; Bolton, M., Coping with clandestine structures in international intervention: landmine clearance agencies in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Sudan (2008) Südosteuropa, 56 (1), pp. 8-34; Bolton, M., (2010) Foreign aid and landmine clearance: Governance, politics and security in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Sudan, , I.B.

The efficiency of existing search algorithms such as k-dimensional tree method and locality-sensitive hashing heavily depends on the size of the signature library and usually is inversely proportional to the library scale. Additionally, since the two-norm based objective function is quite sensitive to the outliers, the abnormally distributed measurement errors will bias the solution of the traditional chi-square or maximum likelihood function. In the present paper, the authors propose a heuristic search algorithm and a robust correction method to realize the fast library search and to achieve the more accurate results, respectively. Instead of searching in the signature library, the authors perform the search procedure in an extra constructed Jacobian library using the principle of gradient-based iteration algorithms, by which the fast search speed can be achieved for an arbitrary scale library. After the search, a robust correction procedure is performed on the basis of the searched optimal parameter set to obtain the more accurate results. Simulations and experiments performed on an etched silicon grating have demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed heuristic search algorithm and robust correction method. © 2015 American Vacuum Society.",,"Raymond, C.J., Murnane, M.R., Prins, S.L., Naqvi, S.S.H., Hosch, J.W., McNeil, J.R., (1997) J.

La Cienega Blvd., #307, Beverly Hills, CA, United States","Pelvic organ prolapse is a prevalent condition, with up to 12 % of women requiring surgery in their lifetime. This manuscript reviews the treatment options for apical prolapse, specifically. Both conservative and surgical management options are acceptable and should be based on patient preferences. Pessaries are the most commonly used conservative management options. Guided pelvic floor muscle training is more beneficial than self-taught Kegel exercises, though may not be effective for high stage or apical prolapse. Surgical treatment options include abdominal and vaginal approaches, the latter of which can be performed open, laparoscopically, and robotically. A systematic review has demonstrated that sacrocolpopexy has better long-term success for treatment of apical prolapse than vaginal techniques, but vaginal surgery can be considered an acceptable alternative. Recent data has demonstrated equal efficacy between uterosacral ligament suspension and sacrospinous ligament suspension at 1 year. To date, two randomized controlled trials have demonstrated equal efficacy between robotic and laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy. Though abdominal approaches may have increased long-term durability, when counseling their patients, surgeons should consider longer operating times and increased pain and cost with these procedures compared to vaginal surgery. Key Points: • Pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) with a physical therapist is the best approach to conservative management of apical prolapse [10]. • Pessaries should be managed with regular follow-up care to minimize complications [14•]. • Minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy appears as effective as the gold standard abdominal sacrocolpopexy (ASC) [42•]. • Robotic assisted sacrocolpopexy (RASC) and laparoscopic assisted sacrocolpopexy (LASC) are equally effective and should be utilized by pelvic floor surgeons based on their skill level and expertise in laparoscopy [44, 45•]. • Uterosacral ligament suspension (USLS) and sacrospinous ligament suspension (SSLS) are considered equally effective procedures and can be combined with a vaginal hysterectomy. • Obliterative procedures are effective but are considered definitive surgery [24••]. • The use of transvaginal mesh has been shown in some studies to be superior to native tissue repairs with regard to anatomic outcomes, but complication rates are higher. Transvaginal mesh should be reserved for surgeons with adequate training so that complications are minimized. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Apical support; Apical suspension; Pelvic organ prolapse;

The FMS scheduling problem is formulated using timed colored Petri net (TCPN) modeling where each operation has a certain number of preconditions, an estimated duration, and a set of postconditions. Based on the reachability analysis of TCPN modeling, we propose a new anytime heuristic search algorithm which finds optimal or near-optimal DL-free schedules with respect to makespan as the performance criterion. The methodology tackles the time-constrained problem of very demanding systems (high diversity production and make-to-order) in which computational time is a critical factor to produce optimal schedules that are DL-free. In such a rapidly changing environment and under tight customer due-dates, producing optimal schedules becomes intractable given the time limitations and the NP-hard nature of scheduling problems. The proposed anytime search algorithm combines breadth-first iterative deepening A∗ with suboptimal breadth-first heuristic search and backtracking. It guarantees that the search produces the best solution obtained so far within the allotted computation time and provides better solutions when given more time. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark set of DL-prone FMS examples and the computational results show the superiority of the proposed approach over the previous works. © 2013 IEEE.","Anytime heuristic search; deadlock-free; flexible manufacturing systems (FMS); Petri nets (PN); reachability analysis; scheduling","Lee, D.Y., Dicesare, F., Scheduling flexible manufacturing systems using petri nets and heuristic search (1994) IEEE Tra Ns.

A wafer cassette with 25 identical wafers is transported by an overhead hoist transfer (OHT) between cluster tools and stored in a stocker when the corresponding tool is not available. Due to a large number of tools and wafer cassettes in a fab, it is extremely complicated to operate OHTs so as to minimize the idle times of the tools. Therefore, fabs tend to reduce the transportation tasks by arranging tools in a line with a buffer. In this paper, we introduce a new system called in-line multiple cluster tools which have many challenging operation issues for researchers and propose simple and practical methods to operate the system. We first develop mixed integer programming models to assign wafers to parallel PMs and derive a priority rule-based scheduling policy for the EFEM operation while minimizing the makespan of producing 25 wafers. We also propose multimode operation in which a component tool in the system processes multiple wafer types at the same time to improve the utilization rate of the tool. © 2015 IEEE.","In-line multiple cluster tools; mixed integer programming (MIP); multimode operational strategy; scheduling","Kim, H.-J., Lee, J.-H., Kim, C., Baik, S.H., Lee, T.-E., Scheduling in-line multiple cluster tools: A decomposition approach (2012) Proc.

The timing-synchronization between the laser oscillator, welding robot and hydraulic pressure devices was established by employing high-speed camera observations together with electrical signal control among the three components. Moreover, the yoke-drop time measured by the camera was used to prevent underestimation of the crack length. The laser beam melt-run welding used a variable welding speed from 10.0 to 40.0 mm/s, while the gas tungsten arc welding varied the welding speed from 1.67 to 5.00 mm/s. As the welding speed increased from 1.67 to 40.0mm/s, the solidification brittle temperature range of type 310S stainless steel welds was reduced from 146 to 120 K. It follows that employing the laser beam welding process mitigates the solidification cracking susceptibility for type 310S stainless steel welds. © 2015, The Korean Institute of Metals and Materials and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","defect; metals; segregation; solidification; welding","Jang, J.H., Joo, B.D., Tyne, C.J.V., Moon, Y.H., (2013) Met.

Here, we tested manual and conceptual abilities of 41 chronic stroke patients in order to examine their relationship. Manual abilities were assed through a reaching task using an exoskeleton robot. Semantic abilities were assessed with implicit as well as explicit semantic tasks, for both verbs and nouns. The results show that that the degree of selective impairment for action word processing was predicted by the degree of impairment in reaching performance. Moreover, the implicit semantic measures showed a correlation with a global reaching parameter, while the explicit semantic similarity judgment task predicted performance in action initiation. These results suggest that action concepts are dynamically grounded through motoric simulations, and that more details are simulated for more explicit semantic tasks. This is evidence for a close and causal relationship between sensory-motor and conceptual systems of the brain. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Action; Embodiment; Language; Semantics; Stroke","Bak, T.H., O'Donovan, D.G., Xuereb, J.H., Boniface, S., Hodges, J.R., Selective impairment of verb processing associated with pathological changes in Brodmann areas 44 and 45 in the motor neurone disease-dementia-aphasia syndrome (2001) Brain, 124, pp. 103-120; Balota, D.A., Yap, M.J., Cortese, M.J., Hutchison, K.A., Kessler, B., Loftis, B., Neely, J.H., Treiman, R., The english lexicon project (2007) Behav.

For tremor, DBS is implanted in the ventrointermedius (Vim) nucleus of the thalamus, a region that relays proprioceptive information for movement sensation (kinaesthesia). Gait disturbances have been observed with bilateral Vim DBS, but the long-term effects on proprioceptive processing are unknown. We aimed to determine whether Vim DBS surgical implantation or stimulation leads to proprioceptive deficits in the upper limb. We assessed two groups of tremor subjects on measures of proprioception (kinaesthesia, position sense) and motor function using a robotic exoskeleton. In the first group (Surgery), we tested patients before and after implantation of Vim DBS, but before DBS was turned on to determine if proprioceptive deficits were inherent to tremor or caused by DBS implantation. In the second group (Stim), we tested subjects with chronically implanted Vim DBS ON and OFF stimulation. Compared to controls, there were no proprioceptive deficits before or after DBS implantation in the Surgery group. Surprisingly, those that received chronic long-term stimulation (LT-stim, 3–10 years) displayed significant proprioceptive deficits ON and OFF stimulation not present in subjects with chronic short-term stimulation (ST-stim, 0.5–2 years). LT-stim had significantly larger variability and reduced workspace area during the position sense assessment. During the kinesthetic assessment, LT-stim made significantly larger directional errors and consistently underestimated the speed of the robot, despite generating normal movement speeds during motor assessment. Chronic long-term Vim DBS may potentially disrupt proprioceptive processing, possibly inducing irreversible plasticity in the Vim nucleus and/or its network connections. Our findings in the upper limb may help explain some of the gait disturbances seen by others following Vim DBS. © 2015 Semrau, Herter, Kiss and Dukelow.","Deep brain stimulation (DBS); Kinesthesia; Position sense; Proprioception; Sensorimotor; Tremor","Anderson, T., Hu, B., Pittman, Q., Kiss, Z.H., Mechanisms of deep brain stimulation: An intracellular study in rat thalamus (2004) J.

Among others, the challenges result mostly from variable communication delays, access constraints, and resource constraints. An event-based control and scheduling (EBCS) codesign strategy for NECSs involving a set of continuous-time LTI plants is proposed in this paper addressing all aforementioned challenges. A novel representation of the network-induced delay as an uncertain variable belonging to a finite set of different bounded intervals is further proposed. The transition from one bounded interval to another can be arbitrary or according to a stochastic process. Regarding the type of the transition and the resulting discrete-time switched polytopic system of the NECS, two versions of the EBCS problem are introduced: A robust EBCS problem under arbitrary transition and a stochastic EBCS problem under stochastic transition. Global uniform practical stability with guaranteed performance (measured by a quadratic cost function) is guaranteed for both versions after formulating them as LMI optimization problems. The effectiveness of the proposed EBCS strategy is illustrated along with a comparison between its versions for a set of mobile robots. Notably, the EBCS strategy is generally applicable to discrete-time switched polytopic systems. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Control and scheduling codesign; Embedded control systems; event-based control; Markov process; Networked control systems; polytopic uncertainty; stationary process","Yang, T.C., Networked control system: A brief survey (2006) Proc.

In this paper, we explore the use of varying transmission powers to increase the performance of a wireless localization system. To this extent, we have designed a robot positioning system based on wireless motes. Our motes use an inexpensive, low-power sub-1-GHz system-on-chip (CC1110) working in the 433-MHz ISM band. Our localization algorithm is based on a particle filter and infers the robot position by: (1) comparing the power received with the expected one; and (2) integrating the robot displacement. We demonstrate that the use of transmitters that vary their transmission power over time improves the performance of the wireless positioning system significantly, with respect to a system that uses fixed power transmitters. This opens the door for applications where the robot can localize itself actively by requesting the transmitters to change their power in real time. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Motes; Particle filters; Robot localization; WiFi localization; Wireless localization","Thrun, S., Burgard, W., Fox, D., (2005) Probabilistic Robotics, , MIT Press: Cambridge, MA, USA; Tardos, J.D., Neira, J., Newman, P.M., Leonard, J.J., Robust Mapping and Localization in Indoor Environments Using Sonar Data (2002) Int.

In these cases, it is necessary for a team of robots to build maps independently and merge them into a single global map. In this paper, octree-based occupancy grids, which are currently the state-of-the-art 3-D map representation, are applied to the problem of multirobot mapping. Octrees allow large environments to be mapped efficiently, in terms of memory usage, while still providing sufficiently fine resolution where required. The main contribution of this work lies in the definition and validation of a system, which use map data from commonly mapped portions of the environment with registration techniques, such that maps are merged coherently despite measurement noise and error in the relative transformations between maps for experimental data sets. The system defined can then be used in a complete solution that is ported to mobile robots. The results demonstrate that octree occupancy grids are a suitable representation for multirobot 3-D mapping, but that the proposed techniques for improving erroneous transformation estimates between map frames allow multiple maps to be merged efficiently and robustly.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928974447

AVs are requested to serve a number of workstations (WS) (following a specified desired production plan for materials requirements) while taking into account the safe movement (collisions avoidance) in the shop floor as well as time duration and energy resources. The proposed approach is based on the Bump-Surface concept to represent the 2D environment through a single mathematical entity. The solution of the combined problem of path planning and task scheduling is searched on a higher-dimension B-surface (in our case 3D) in such a way that its inverse image into the robot environment satisfies the given objectives and constraints. Then, a modified Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to search for a near-optimum solution. The objective of the fleet coordination consists of determining the best feasible paths for the AVs so that all the WS are served at the lowest possible cost. The efficiency of the developed method is investigated and discussed through characteristic simulated experiments concerning a variety of operating environments.

However, there are few methods for assessing such robots. This article proposes two types of assessment measures based on typical judgments of clinicians. One of the measures involves the evaluation of how well the simulator presents different severities of a specified disease. Experienced clinicians were requested to rate the simulated symptoms in terms of severity, and the consistency of their ratings was used as a performance measure. The other measure involves the evaluation of how well the simulator presents different types of symptoms. In this case, the clinicians were requested to classify the simulated resistances in terms of symptom type, and the average ratios of their answers were used as performance measures. For both types of assessment measures, a higher index implied higher agreement among the experienced clinicians that subjectively assessed the symptoms based on typical symptom features. We applied these two assessment methods to a patient knee robot and achieved positive appraisals. The assessment measures have potential for use in comparing several patient simulators for training physical therapists, rather than as absolute indices for developing a standard. © 2015 Ishikawa et al.",,"Wakura, S., Masutani, Y., Nishimura, A., Patient simulating robot for rehabilitation education and rehabilitation education method (2006), JPKikuchi, T., Oda, K., Yamaguchi, S., Furusho, J., Leg-robot with MR clutch to realize virtual spastic movements (2010) Journal of Intelligent Material Systems and Structures, 21, pp. 1523-1529;

An efficient finite element formulation, absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) is employed to describe nonlinear modeling for flexible link manipulator with large deflection, in which both the transverse normal strain and the shear strain are considered. In comparison to other large deflection formulations, the motion equations contain constant mass matrix, and also, the Coriolis and centrifugal forces are identically equal to zero because the terms arising from geometric elastic nonlinearity are moved to stiffness, reactive and external forces, which are originally nonlinear. This makes the formulation particularly efficient in computational terms and numerically more stable than alternative geometrically nonlinear formulations based on lower-order terms. In this investigation, the equations of motion are derived taking into account the shear deformable using the ANCF based approaches. Then, a method for determination of the dynamic load carrying capacity (DLCC) for geometrically nonlinear elastic robot is described giving attentionto accuracy and actuator constraints. In order to initially check the validity of the dynamic equations, the proposed model has been implemented and tested on a single-link very flexible arm. A simulation study is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the presented algorithm for finding DLCC of very flexible link manipulators. The results illustrate the power and efficiency of the method to overcome the high nonlinearity nature of the problem. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This work contributes to the field of passive mechanical system safety. The proposed security system consists in a flexible linkage that splits a robot arm link in two parts. Such a linkage allows the link to remain completely rigid as long as a given torque threshold is not exceeded, with that threshold being configurable according to working conditions and safety considerations.

P.; Chan, W. L.; Yan, R.; Chua, Y.; Limbu, D. K.","In this paper, we propose a role adaptation method for human–robot shared control. Game theory is employed for fundamental analysis of this two-agent system. An adaptation law is developed such that the robot is able to adjust its own role according to the human’s intention to lead or follow, which is inferred through the measured interaction force. In the absence of human interaction forces, the adaptive scheme allows the robot to take the lead and complete the task by itself. On the other hand, when the human persistently exerts strong forces that signal an unambiguous intent to lead, the robot yields and becomes the follower. Additionally, the full spectrum of mixed roles between these extreme scenarios is afforded by continuous online update of the control that is shared between both agents. Theoretical analysis shows that the resulting shared control is optimal with respect to a two-agent coordination game. Experimental results illustrate better overall performance, in terms of both error and effort, compared with fixed-role interactions.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928732936

The proposed Saturation in the Null Space (SNS) algorithm proceeds by successively discarding the use of joints that would exceed their motion bounds when using the minimum norm solution. When processing multiple tasks with priority, the SNS method realizes a preemptive strategy by preserving the correct order of priority in spite of the presence of saturations. In the single- and multitask case, the algorithm automatically integrates a least possible task-scaling procedure, when an original task is found to be unfeasible. The optimality properties of the SNS algorithm are analyzed by considering an associated quadratic programming problem. Its solution leads to a variant of the algorithm, which guarantees optimality even when the basic SNS algorithm does not. Numerically efficient versions of these algorithms are proposed. Their performance allows real-time control of robots executing many prioritized tasks with a large number of hard bounds.

The device is conceived for being used as a conventional spherical joint or converted in a universal joint, or still downgraded to a revolute pair. Therefore different configurations can be chosen according to user needs. In particular, two of the three axes of revolution, arranged in the typical roll-pitch-roll sequence of robot spherical wrists, can be locked alternately in order to provide two differently arranged universal joints. It can be demonstrated that such behavior allows to activate different mobilities of a class of reconfigurable parallel kinematics manipulators and for this task the device has been dimensioned. The transition between such mobilities occurs exploiting the concept of over-constrained kinematics, which is realized by the lockable joint during the switching phase in order to avoid an instantaneous mobility of the robot. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Lockable joint; Metamorphic mechanism; Reconfigurable robot; Spherical joint",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928641433

This algorithm is quite popular within the robotics community for the production of trained neural networks without having to determine a priori their size and topology. The main drawback of the traditional NEAT algorithm is that, even though it can implement recurrent synaptic connections, which allow it to perform some time related processing tasks, its capabilities are rather limited, especially when dealing with precise time dependent phenomena. NEAT’s ability to capture the underlying dynamics that correspond to complex time series still has a lot of room for improvement. To address this issue, the paper describes a new implementation of the NEAT algorithm that is able to generate artificial neural networks (ANNs) with trainable time delayed synapses in addition to its previous capacities. We show that this approach, called (Formula presented.)-NEAT improves the behavior of the neural networks obtained when dealing with complex time related processes. Several examples are presented, both dealing with the generation of ANNs that are able to produce complex theoretical signals such as chaotic signals or real data series, as in the case of the monthly number of international airline passengers or monthly (Formula presented.) concentrations. In these examples, (Formula presented.)-NEAT clearly improves over the traditional NEAT algorithm in these tasks. A final example of the integration of this approach within a robot cognitive mechanism is also presented, showing the clear improvements it could provide in the modeling required for many cognitive processes. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Cognitive robotics; NEAT; Neuroevolution; Temporal modeling; Time-delay neural networks",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928642256

The hardware performance in contemporary 3-D scanning devices is suitable for online utilization. However, the bottleneck is the lack of real-time algorithms for recognition of geometric primitives (e.g., planes and natural quadrics) from a scanned point cloud. One of the most important and the most frequent geometric primitive in various engineering tasks is plane. In this paper, we propose a new fast one-pass algorithm for recognition (segmentation and fitting) of planar segments from a point cloud. To effectively segment planar regions, we exploit the orthonormality of certain wavelets to polynomial function, as well as their sensitivity to abrupt changes. After segmentation of planar regions, we estimate the parameters of corresponding planes using standard fitting procedures. For point cloud structuring, a z-buffer algorithm with mesh triangles representation in barycentric coordinates is employed. The proposed recognition method is tested and experimentally validated in several real-world case studies. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","3D vision; Industrial automation systems; Intelligent manufacturing systems; Manufacturing automation; Object recognition; Object segmentation; Reverse engineering","Chen, S., Li, Y.F., Finding optimal focusing distance and edge blur distribution for weakly calibrated 3-D vision (2013) IEEE Trans.

This recent trend is further justified by the fact that the robotic manipulators have complex nonlinear dynamic structure with uncertain parameters. Highlighting the authors’ research achievements in the domain of manipulator design and control, this paper presents a systematic and comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art control techniques that find enormous potential in controlling manipulators to execute cutting-edge applications. In particular, three kinds of strategies, i.e., intelligent proportional-integral-derivative (PID) scheme, robust control and adaptation based approaches, are reviewed. Future trend in the subject area is commented. Open-source simulators to facilitate controller design are also tabulated.

Electromyography (EMG) is one of the most common and intuitive methods used for detecting gestures based on muscle activities. The EMG, however, is in general, too sensitive to environmental disturbances, such as electrical noise, electromagnetic signals, humidity, and so on. In this paper, a new method for recognizing the muscular activities is proposed based on air-pressure sensors and air-bladders. The muscular activity is detected by measuring the change of the air pressure in an air-bladder contacting the interested muscle(s). Since the change of the air pressure can be more robustly measured compared with the change of electric signals appeared on the skin, the proposed sensing method is useful for mobile devices due to its great signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and fast response time. The principle and applications of the proposed sensing method are introduced in this paper. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of linearity, repeatability, wear-comfort, etc., and is also verified by comparing it with an EMG signal and a motion sensor. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Gesture recognition; Mechanomyography; Wearable sensors","(2014) Distracted Driving: What Research Shows and What States Can Do, , http://ghsa.org/html/publications/sfdist.html, [Online].

This study focuses on planning the time-optimal trajectories for car-like robots. We formulate a dynamic optimization problem, where the kinematic principles are accurately described through differential equations and the constraints are strictly expressed using algebraic inequalities. The formulated dynamic optimization problem is then solved by an interior-point-method-based simultaneous approach. Compared with the prevailing methods in the field of trajectory planning, our proposed method can handle various user-specified requirements and different optimization objectives in a unified manner. Simulation results indicate that our proposal efficiently deals with different kinds of physical constraints, terminal conditions and collision-avoidance requirements that are imposed on the trajectory planning mission. Moreover, we utilize a Hamiltonian-based optimality index to evaluate how close an obtained solution is to being optimal. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.","Car-like robot; Computational guidance and control; Interior-point method; Simultaneous dynamic optimization; Time-optimal control; Trajectory planning","Gasparetto, A., Zanotto, V., Optimal trajectory planning for industrial robots (2010) Adv Eng Softw, 41 (4), pp. 548-556; Huang, W., Optimal multi-impulse orbit transfer using nonlinear relative motion dynamics (2014) J Astronaut Sci, 59 (1), pp. 237-258; Pharpatara P, P., Missile trajectory shaping using sampling-based path planning (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 2533-8; Li, B., Gong, L., Yang, W., An improved artificial bee colony algorithm based on balance-evolution strategy for unmanned combat aerial vehicle path planning (2014) Sci World J, 2014, pp. 1-10. , 232704; Alejo, D., Cobano, A., Heredia, G., Ollero, A., Collision-free 4D trajectory planning in unmanned aerial vehicles for assembly and structure construction (2014) J Intell Rob Syst, 73 (1), pp. 783-795; Li, B., Chiong, R., Lin, M., A two-layer optimization framework for UAV path planning with interval uncertainties (2014) 2014 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Production and Logistics Systems (CIPLS), pp. 120-7; Chung, T., Hollinger, G., Isler, V., Search and pursuit evasion in mobile robotics (2011) Auton Rob, 31 (4), pp. 299-316; Li, B., Chiong, R., Gong, L., Search-evasion path planning for submarines using the artificial bee colony algorithm (2014) IEEE Congr Evol Comput, pp. 528-535; Soldan, S., Welle, J., Barz, T., Kroll, A., Schulz, D., Towards autonomous robotic systems for remote gas leak detection and localization in industrial environments (2014) Field and Service Robotics, pp. 233-247. , K.

Gestures are often preprogrammed off-line or generated by mapping motion capture data to the robot. Since these gestures are dependent on the robot’s joint configuration, they cannot be used for other robots. Therefore, when using a new robot platform with a different morphology, new joint trajectories to reach the desired postures need to be implemented. This method aims to minimize the workload when implementing gestures on a new robot platform and facilitate the sharing of gestures between different robots. The innovative aspect of this method is that it is constructed independently of any robot configuration, and therefore it can be used to generate gestures for different robot platforms. To calculate a gesture for a certain configuration, the developed method uses a set of target gestures listed in a database and maps them to that specific configuration. The database currently consists of a set of emotional expressions. The method was validated on the virtual model of different robots and an online survey was performed to evaluate the user’s perception of the output of the method. The results of this survey showed that the calculated gestures for a certain robot configuration well resemble the target gestures, and thus that our developed method to map gestures to different robot morphologies gives good results. © 2015 Taylor & Francis and The Robotics Society of Japan","emotions; generic gesture system; upper body posture",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929011917

The linear and angular velocities of mobile robots are assumed to be unmeasurable. This causes nonlinear coupling terms between the unmeasurable velocities and unknown skidding and slipping effects in the robot dynamics, making the design of an adaptive observer difficult. An adaptive observer is presented to estimate unmeasured velocities of the mobile robots and to compensate for the skidding and slipping effects. Then, a simple adaptive controller at the dynamic level is derived using dynamic surface design methodology. Fuzzy logic systems are employed to overcome the coupling problems between the unmeasurable velocities and unknown skidding and slipping effects in the controller design procedure. From Lyapunov stability analysis, the stability of the controlled closed-loop system is analyzed under slippage conditions. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Adaptive observer; Function approximation; Mobile robots; Unknown skidding and slipping",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928393885

Firstly, a visual system with laser structured light is developed to measure the deviation between the torch and welding seam in horizontal and vertical directions. Secondly, a multiple peak detection algorithm for laser profile is proposed to overcome the interference in high strength reflection area.

Robotic device, on the other hand, can provide intention-driven assistance and is proven capable to complement conventional therapy. However, with many robotic devices focus on more proximal joints like shoulder and elbow, recovery of hand and fingers functions have become a challenge. Here we propose the use of robotic device to assist hand and fingers functions training and we aim to evaluate the potential efficacy of intention-driven robot-assisted fingers training. Methods: Participants (6 to 24 months post-stroke) were randomly assigned into two groups: robot-assisted (robot) and non-assisted (control) fingers training groups. Each participant underwent 20-session training. Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) was used as the primary outcome measure, while, Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) score, its functional tasks (WMFT-FT) sub-score, Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), its shoulder and elbow (FMA-SE) sub-score, and finger individuation index (FII) served as secondary outcome measures. Results: Nineteen patients completed the 20-session training (Trial Registration: HKClinicalTrials.com HKCTR-1554); eighteen of them came back for a 6-month follow-up. Significant improvements (p∈<∈0.05) were found in the clinical scores for both robot and control group after training. However, only robot group maintained the significant difference in the ARAT and FMA-SE six months after the training. The WMFT-FT score and time post-training improvements of robot group were significantly better than those of the control group. Conclusions: This study showed the potential efficacy of robot-assisted fingers training for hand and fingers rehabilitation and its feasibility to facilitate early rehabilitation for a wider population of stroke survivors; and hence, can be used to complement CIMT. © 2015 Susanto et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Chronic stroke; Fingers; Rehabilitation; Robotic rehabilitation; Stroke; Stroke recovery","Mackay, J., Mensah, G.A., (2004) The Atlas of Heart Disease and Stroke, , 19 World Health Organization Geneva, Switzerland; (2003) The World Health Report 2003: Shaping the Future, , WHO Volume 16 World Health Organization Geneva, Switzerland; Dobkin, B.H., Strategies for stroke rehabilitation (2004) Lancet Neurol, 3, pp. 528-536. , 4164204 15324721; Lang, C.E., Wagner, J.M., Bastian, A.J., Hu, Q., Edwards, D.F., Sahrmann, S.A., Dromerick, A.W., Deficits in grasp versus reach during acute hemiparesis (2005) Exp Brain Res, 166, pp. 126-136. , 16021431; Nowak, D., Grefkes, C., Dafotakis, M., Küst, J., Karbe, H., Fink, G.R., Dexterity is impaired at both hands following unilateral subcortical middle cerebral artery stroke (2007) Eur J Neurosci, 25, pp. 3173-3184. , 17561831; Hermsdörfer, J., Hagl, E., Nowak, D., Marquardt, C., Grip force control during object manipulation in cerebral stroke (2003) Clin Neurophysiol, 114, pp. 915-929. , 12738439; Cirstea, M.C., Mitnitski, A.B., Feldman, A.G., Levin, M.F., Interjoint coordination dynamics during reaching in stroke (2003) Exp Brain Res, 151, pp. 289-300. , 1:STN:280:DC%2BD3szltVyisQ%3D%3D 12819841; Kwakkel, G., Wagenaar, R.C., Twisk, J.W., Lankhorst, G.J., Koetsier, J.C., Intensity of leg and arm training after primary middle-cerebral-artery stroke: A randomised trial (1999) Lancet, 354, pp. 191-196. , 1:STN:280:DyaK1MzkslKlug%3D%3D 10421300; Nakayama, H., Jørgensen, H.S., Raaschou, H.O., Olsen, T.S., Recovery of upper extremity function in stroke patients: The Copenhagen Stroke Study (1994) Arch Phys Med Rehabil, 75, pp. 394-398. , 1:STN:280:DyaK2c3is1Cqtg%3D%3D 8172497; Go, A.S., Mozaffarian, D., Roger, V.L., Benjamin, E.J., Berry, J.D., Blaha, M.J., Heart disease and stroke statistics - 2014 update: A report from the American heart association (2014) Circulation, 129, pp. 28-e292. , 24352519; Kelly-Hayes, M., Beiser, A., Kase, C.S., Scaramucci, A., D'Agostino, R.B., Wolf, P.A., The influence of gender and age on disability following ischemic stroke: The Framingham study (2003) J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis, 12, pp. 119-126. , 17903915; Kwakkel, G., Kollen, B.J., Van Der Grond, J., Prevo, A.J.H., Probability of regaining dexterity in the flaccid upper limb: Impact of severity of paresis and time since onset in acute stroke (2003) Stroke, 34, pp. 2181-2186. , 12907818; Kwakkel, G., Kollen, B.J., Krebs, H.I., Effects of robot-assisted therapy on upper limb recovery after stroke: A systematic review (2008) Neurorehabil Neural Repair, 22, pp. 111-121. , 2730506 17876068; Langhorne, P., Coupar, F., Pollock, A., Motor recovery after stroke: A systematic review (2009) Lancet Neurol, 8, pp. 741-754. , 19608100; Langhorne, P., Bernhardt, J., Kwakkel, G., Stroke rehabilitation (2011) Lancet, 377, pp. 1693-1702. , 21571152; Taub, E., Movement in nonhuman primates deprived of somatosensory feedback (1976) Exerc Sport Sci Rev, 4, pp. 335-374. , 828579; Taub, E., Crago, J.E., Burgio, L.D., Groomes, T.E., Cook, E.W., Deluca, S.C., Miller, N.E., An operant approach to rehabilitation medicine: Overcoming learned nonuse by shaping (1994) J Exp Anal Behav, 61, pp. 281-293. , 1334416 1:STN:280:DyaK2c3itlaluw%3D%3D 8169577; Taub, E., Crago, J.E., Uswatte, G., Constraint-induced movement therapy: A new approach to treatment in physical rehabilitation (1998) Rehabil Psychol, 43, pp. 152-170; Taub, E., Uswatte, G., Elbert, T., New treatments in neurorehabilitation founded on basic research (2002) Nat Rev Neurosci, 3, pp. 228-236. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD38Xit1Grtb8%3D 11994754; Wolf, S.L., Thompson, P., Winstein, C.J., Miller, J.P., Blanton, S.R., Nichols-Larsen, D.S., Morris, D.M., Sawaki, L., The EXCITE Stroke Trial.

Surface roughness measurements require interruption of the process, proper surface cleaning and measurements that sometimes necessitate removal of the part from the machine tool. In this study, stabilisation of surface roughness during polishing rotational symmetric surfaces by the RAP process was monitored by AE measurements. An AE sensor was placed on a polishing arm in direct contact with a bonded abrasive polishing tool, and a cylindrical workpiece in Vanadis 4E steel was polished in 40 polishing passes from an initial turned surface roughness Ra = 3.1 µm down to Ra = 0.07 µm. The polishing task was performed in five intervals and after 4, 8, 20, 30 and 40 passes, the resulting surface roughness was measured. The results show a decreasing trend in measured AE signal power and RMS, which is well qualitatively correlated with the development of surface roughness during polishing. The trend allows the identification of an asymptote representing the process completion (stabilisation of surface roughness), reliable for correct in-process determination of the process endpoint. This makes it possible to reliably determine the right time for changing the polishing media to finer abrasive when applying a given set of parameters is no longer effective to create a smoother surface, thus improving the efficiency of the process. The findings enabling automatic detection of optimal process endpoint allow intelligent process control, creating fundamental elements in development of robust fully automated RAP process for its widespread industrial application. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","acoustic emission; in-process monitoring; robot-assisted polishing; surface roughness",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928399090

A stockpile is modelled as a grid of voxels (octants), which are used as geometric elements for both quality calculations and result storage. The quality calculation is based on the real geometric shape of the stockpile which is measured by a laser scanner. Furthermore, a BWR (Bucket Wheel Reclaimer), which is treated as a mobile robot arm, is incorporated into this model to predicate the quality of the reclaimed material. Thus, this 3D quality embedded model can be used to calculate, plan, control and predict the quality level of iron ore being stacked and/or reclaimed with a great degree of accuracy. This model provides an opportunity to monitor and track quality data throughout the blending operations. It will lead to proactive and continuous blending activities that fundamentally improve quality control and increase efficiency in stockpile management. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Planning collision-free paths for all the robots is a challenge for a multi-robot system, which is also known as the multi-robot cooperative pathfinding problem in which each robot has to navigate from its starting location to the destination while keeping avoiding stationary obstacles as well as the other robots. In this paper, we present a novel fully decentralized approach to this problem. Our approach allows robots to make real-time responses to dynamic environments and can resolve a set of benchmark deadlock situations subject to complex spatial constraints in a shared workspace by means of altruistic coordination. Specifically, when confronted with congested situations, each robot can employ waiting, moving-forwards, dodging, retreating and turning-head strategies to make local adjustments. Most importantly, each robot only needs to coordinate and communicate with the others that are located within its coordinated network in our approach, which can reduce communication overhead in fully decentralized multi-robot systems. In addition, experimental results also show that our proposed approach provides an efficient and competitive solution to this problem. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Collision avoidance; Cooperative pathfinding; Coordination; Multi-robot systems",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928347384

Due to the factor that the deadzone nonlinearity is widespread in the actuators, a smooth inverse adaptive deadzone is incorporated to minimize the effect of the deadzone nonlinearity in the dual arm robot system to guarantee a high accuracy tracking. Since these type of robots are usually applied in complex environments, a multi-input multi-output fuzzy logic unit is adopted to approximate the manipulator’s dynamics to achieve a accuracy tracking performances. Moreover, a decentralized robust fuzzy adaptive control scheme is constructed to make the motion and internal forces track a reference trajectories in the presence of parameters uncertainty and external disturbance.

During RALP, the patient must be in a steep Trendelenburg (head-down) position, which leads to a significant increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). The association of RALP with visual field sensitivity, however, has not been prospectively studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively the visual field, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, and optic disc morphology in 50 normal eyes of 25 male patients that underwent RALP. Methods: The subjects were 25 males among 33 consecutive patients who underwent uneventful RALP under general anesthesia in our hospital. Visual field tests using the Humphrey visual field analyzer 30-2 SITA-standard program were performed before, 7 days after, and 1-3 months after RALP. IOP was measured before, during, and after RALP; and ophthalmologic examinations, including slit-lamp, fundus examination, and optical coherence tomography (OCT), were scheduled before and 7 days after surgery. Results: IOP was significantly increased during RALP up to 29.4 mmHg (P<0.01). Postoperative local visual field defects were detected in 7 eyes of 7 subjects dominantly in the lower hemifield without abnormal findings in the optic nerve head or retina, and the visual field recovered to normal within 3 months after surgery. General factors associated with RALP, IOP, RNFL thickness, or optic disc parameters did not differ significantly between eyes with and without postoperative visual field defects, and parameters of OCT measurements were not altered after surgery. Conclusion: Transient but significant unilateral visual field defects were found in 28% of the subjects examined. The probable cause are the increased IOP and altered perfusion during surgery and ophthalmologic examinations are therefore suggested before and after RALP. © 2015 Taketani et al.",,"Rassweiler, J., Hruza, M., Teber, D., Su, L.M., Laparoscopic and robotic assisted radical prostatectomy - Critical analysis of the results (2006) Eur Urol, 49, pp. 612-624. , PMID: 16442210; Molloy, B.L., Implications for postoperative visual loss: Steep trendelenburg position and effects on intraocular pressure (2011) AANA J, 79, pp. 115-121. , PMID: 21560974; Awad, H., Santilli, S., Ohr, M., Roth, A., Yan, W., Fernandez, S., The effects of steep trendelenburg positioning on intraocular pressure during robotic radical prostatectomy (2009) Anesth Analg, 109, pp. 473-478. , PMID: 19608821; Awad, H., Walker, C.M., Shaikh, M., Dimitrova, G.T., Abaza, R., O'Hara, J., Anesthetic considerations for robotic prostatectomy: A review of the literature (2012) J Clin Anesth, 24, pp. 494-504. , PMID: 22986320; Lestar, M., Gunnarsson, L., Lagerstrand, L., Wiklund, P., Odeberg-Wernerman, S., Hemodynamic Perturbations During Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy in 45 degrees Trendelenburg Position (2011) Anesthesia and Analgesia, 113, pp. 1069-1075. , PMID: 21233502; Bushley, D.M., Parmley, V.C., Paglen, P., Visual field defect associated with laser in situ keratomileusis (2000) Am J Ophthalmol, 129, pp. 668-671. , PMID: 10844064; Weiss, H.S., Rubinfeld, R.S., Anderschat, J.F., Case reports and small case series: LASIK-associated visual field loss in a glaucoma suspect (2001) Arch Ophthalmol, 119, pp. 774-775. , PMID: 11346411; Weber, E.D., Colyer, M.H., Lesser, R.L., Subramanian, P.S., Posterior ischemic optic neuropathy after minimally invasive prostatectomy (2007) Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology, 27, pp. 285-287. , PMID: 18090562; Hoshikawa, Y., Tsutsumi, N., Ohkoshi, K., Serizawa, S., Hamada, M., Inagaki, K., The effect of steep Trendelenburg positioning on intraocular pressure and visual function during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (2014) British Journal of Ophthalmology, 98, pp. 305-308. , PMID: 24064941; Anderson, D.R., Patella, V.M., (1999) Automated Static Perimetry, , Mosby, St.Louis; Katz, D.M., Trobe, J.D., Cornblath, W.T., Kline, L.B., Ischemic optic neuropathy after lumbar spine surgery (1994) Arch Ophthalmol, 112, pp. 925-931. , PMID: 8031272; Murphy, M.A., Bilateral posterior ischemic optic neuropathy after lumbar spine surgery (2003) Ophthalmology, 110, pp. 1454-1457. , PMID: 12867409; Hoff, J.M., Varhaug, P., Midelfart, A., Lund-Johansen, M., Acute visual loss after spinal surgery (2010) Acta Ophthalmol, 88, pp. 490-492. , PMID: 19416117; Larkin, D.F., Wood, A.E., Neligan, M., Eustace, P., Ischaemic optic neuropathy complicating cardiopulmonary bypass (1987) Br J Ophthalmol, 71, pp. 344-347. , PMID: 3495292; Rizzo, J.F., 3rd, Lessell, S., Posterior ischemic optic neuropathy during general surgery (1987) Am J Ophthalmol, 103, pp. 808-811. , PMID: 3496009; Sadaba, L.M., Garcia-Layana, A., Maldonado, M.J., Berian, J.M., Bilateral ischemic optic neuropathy after transurethral prostatic resection: A case report (2006) BMC Ophthalmol, 6, p. 32. , PMID: 17034630; Hayreh, S.S., Posterior ischaemic optic neuropathy: Clinical features, pathogenesis, and management (2004) Eye (Lond), 18, pp. 1188-1206. , PMID: 15534605; Trible, J.R., Anderson, D.R., Factors associated with intraocular pressure-induced acute visual field depression (1997) Arch Ophthalmol, 115, pp. 1523-1527. , PMID: 9400785; Linder, B.J., Trick, G.L., Wolf, M.L., Altering body position affects intraocular pressure and visual function (1988) Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci, 29, pp. 1492-1497. , PMID: 3170121; Colotto, A., Falsini, B., Salgarello, T., Buzzonetti, L., Cermola, S., Porrello, G., Transiently raised intraocular pressure reveals pattern electroretinogram losses in ocular hypertension (1996) Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci, 37, pp. 2663-2670. , PMID: 8977480; Yoo, Y.C., Shin, S., Choi, E.K., Kim, C.Y., Choi, Y.D., Bai, S.J., Increase in intraocular pressure is less with propofol than with sevoflurane during laparoscopic surgery in the steep Trendelenburg position (2014) Canadian Journal of Anesthesia-Journal Canadien D Anesthesie, 61, pp. 322-329. , PMID: 24500661; Chen, X., Zhao, M., White, P.F., Li, S., Tang, J., Wender, R.H., The recovery of cognitive function after general anesthesia in elderly patients: A comparison of desflurane and sevoflurane (2001) Anesth Analg, 93, pp. 1489-1494. , table of contents.

This study aims to characterize a new MRI compliant method of propulsion for swimming robots using the magnetohydrodynamic effect (MHD). An MHD drive is a method of propulsion employing only electromagnetic elements, without the need for moving mechanical parts. By utilizing MHD voltages induced within the MRI magnetic field, the opportunity to propel a device and provide imaging simultaneously is presented. We hypothesized that a wireless MHD-driven thruster could be developed to control endocapsules within the MRI magnetic field. A model capsule was constructed and evaluated in a scaled MRI-environment, and subsequently, tested for MRI-compatibility at 3 T. Dynamic performance of the endocapsule was characterized as input power was varied. In the scaled MRI environment, a peak force of 0.31 mN was observed, providing evidence that an MHD-driven endocapsule is possible in an MRI environment. Increased forces will be obtainable with increases in magnetic field strength and applied power.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928311206

Recent advances in miniaturized biophotonics probes have permitted the development of endomicroscopy techniques that are clinically attractive. With these approaches, cellular-level imaging can be achieved through millimetre-scale flexible probes and be performed in real-time, in vivo and in situ. Due to the limited field of view and flexibility of these probes, however, large area tissue coverage for acquiring histology-like images over complex three-dimensional surfaces is challenging. This is particularly the case because current surgical robots, such as the Da (Formula presented.), lack haptic feedback, making it difficult to maintain optimum tissue contact when these probes are deployed in vivo. Methods: This paper proposes a simple force-controlled pick-up probe that can be integrated with the Da Vinci instruments for intraoperative endomicroscopy imaging. The device uses a new low-friction air bearing with adaptive axial force control to maintain constant contact between the tissue and the imaging probe, facilitating microscopy scans over complex surfaces. Detailed ex vivo user experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique. Results: The adaptive probe mount could achieve consistent low-magnitude probe–sample contact forces compared with a rigid mount. In the user study, the adaptive probe combined with a high frame rate endomicroscopy system allowed larger mosaics to be generated over curved surfaces. Conclusions: The device can improve the performance of large area mosaicking over complex 3D surfaces with improved handling and intraoperative control. © 2015 CARS","Adaptive control; Endomicroscopy; Endoscopy; Image Guidance; Mosaicking; Robotic-assisted MIS",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928128781

The present paper is the extension of our experience with robotic system and to best of our knowledge this represents the largest series of robotic transthoracic esophagectomy worldwide. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the robotic transthoracic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer in a series of patients from a single institute. Methods: A retrospective review of medical records was conducted for 83 esophageal cancer patients who underwent robotic esophagectomy at our institute from December 2009 to December 2012. All patients underwent a thorough clinical examination and pre-operative investigations. All patients underwent robotic esophageal mobilization. En-bloc dissection with lymphadenectomy was performed in all cases with preservation of Azygous vein. Relevant data were gathered from medical records. Results: The study population comprised of 50 men and 33 women with mean age of 59.18 years. The mean operative time was 204.94 mins (range 180 to 300). The mean blood loss was 86.75 ml (range 50 to 200). The mean number of lymph node yield was 18. 36 (range 13 to 24). None of the patient required conversion. The mean ICU stay and hospital stay was 1 day (range 1 to 3) and 10.37 days (range 10 to 13), respectively. A total of 16 (19.28%) complication were reported in these patents. Commonly reported complication included dysphagia, pleural effusion and anastomotic leak. No treatment related mortality was observed. After a median follow-up period of 10 months, 66 patients (79.52%) survived with disease free stage. Conclusions: We found robot-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy feasible in cases of esophageal cancer.

The present paper is the extension of our experience with robotic system and to best of our knowledge this represents the largest series of robotic transthoracic esophagectomy worldwide. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the robotic transthoracic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer in a series of patients from a single institute. Methods: A retrospective review of medical records was conducted for 83 esophageal cancer patients who underwent robotic esophagectomy at our institute from December 2009 to December 2012. All patients underwent a thorough clinical examination and pre-operative investigations. All patients underwent robotic esophageal mobilization. En-bloc dissection with lymphadenectomy was performed in all cases with preservation of Azygous vein. Relevant data were gathered from medical records. Results: The study population comprised of 50 men and 33 women with mean age of 59.18 years. The mean operative time was 204.94 mins (range 180 to 300). The mean blood loss was 86.75 ml (range 50 to 200). The mean number of lymph node yield was 18. 36 (range 13 to 24). None of the patient required conversion. The mean ICU stay and hospital stay was 1 day (range 1 to 3) and 10.37 days (range 10 to 13), respectively. A total of 16 (19.28%) complication were reported in these patents. Commonly reported complication included dysphagia, pleural effusion and anastomotic leak. No treatment related mortality was observed. After a median follow-up period of 10 months, 66 patients (79.52%) survived with disease free stage. Conclusions: We found robot-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy feasible in cases of esophageal cancer. The procedure allowed precise en-bloc dissection with lymphadenectomy in mediastinum with reduced operative time, blood loss and complications. © 2015 Puntambekar et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928625653

It is now well established that current identification methods have non-negligible limitations such as a difficult feature matching, the requirement of external tools and the intervention of multiple people. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to identify the geometric parameters of 3D vision systems mounted on robots without involving other people or additional equipment. In particular, our method focuses on legged robots which have complex body structures and excellent locomotion ability compared to their wheeled/tracked counterparts. The parameters can be identified only by moving robots on a relatively flat ground. Concretely, an estimation approach is provided to calculate the ground plane. In addition, the relationship between the robot and the ground is modeled. The parameters are obtained by formulating the identification problem as an optimization problem. The methodology is integrated on a legged robot called “Octopus”, which can traverse through rough terrains with high stability after obtaining the identification parameters of its mounted vision system using the proposed method. Diverse experiments in different environments demonstrate our novel method is accurate and robust. © 2015 by the authors.","3D vision system; Coordinate identification methodology; Hexapod robot","Bazeille, S., Barasuol, V., Focchi, M., Havoutis, I., Frigerio, M., Buchli, J., Semini, C., Caldwell, D.G., Vision Enhanced Reactive Locomotion Control for Trotting on Rough Terrain (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Practical Robot Applications (Tepra), pp. 1-6. , Woburn, MA, USA, 22-23 April; Walas, K., Terrain Classification Using Vision, Depth and Tactile Perception (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 RGB-D: Advanced Reasoning with Depth Cameras in Conjunction with RSS, , Berlin, Germany, 27 July; Stelzer, A., Hirschmuller, H., Gorner, M., Stereo-Vision-Based Navigation of a Six-Legged Walking Robot in Unknown Rough Terrain (2012) Int.

The approach taken in this paper is to reduce the reliance on the human designer by adapting the representation to improve the generalisation during the learning process. An extension of a Hierarchical Fuzzy Rule-Based System (HFRBS) is proposed that identifies and refines inaccurate regions of a fuzzy controller, while interacting with the environment, for both supervised and reinforcement learning problems. The paper shows that a controller using an adaptive HFRBS can learn a suitable control policy using a fewer number of fuzzy rules for both a supervised and reinforcement learning problem and is not sensitive to the layout as with a uniform representation. In supervised learning problems, a small number of extra trials are required to find an effective representation but for reinforcement learning problems, the process of adapting the representation is shown to significantly reduce the time taken to learn a suitable control policy and hence open the door to high-dimensional problems. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Fuzzy systems; Reinforcement learning; Robotics",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928141182

For this purpose, a passive mechanical lower arm (PMLA) was developed that mimics the human impact response and is suitable for systematic impact testing and prediction of mild contusions and lacerations. A mathematical model of the passive human lower arm is adopted to the control of the PMLA. Its biofidelity is verified by a number of comparative impact experiments with the PMLA and a human volunteer. The respective dynamic impact responses show very good consistency and support the fact that the developed device may serve as a human substitute in safety analysis for the described conditions. The collision tests were performed with two different robots: the DLR Lightweight Robot III (LWR-III) and the EPSON PS3L industrial robot. The data acquired in the PMLA impact experiments were used to encapsulate the results in a robot independent safety curve, taking into account robot's reflected inertia, velocity and impact geometry.

Moreover, the improvement of the quality of life for the elderly is one of the first priorities in modern countries and societies. In this work, we present an informationally structured room that is aimed at supporting the daily life activities of elderly people. This room integrates different sensor modalities in a natural and non-invasive way inside the environment. The information gathered by the sensors is processed and sent to a centralized management system, which makes it available to a service robot assisting the people. One important restriction of our intelligent room is reducing as much as possible any interference with daily activities. Finally, this paper presents several experiments and situations using our intelligent environment in cooperation with our service robot. © 2015 by the authors.","Ambient intelligence; Assistive technologies; Distributed sensors; Intelligent sensors; Service robotics; Smart home","Nugent, C., Finlay, D., Fiorini, P., Tsumaki, Y., Prassler, E., Home Automation as a Means of Independent Living (2008) IEEE Trans.

For the rapid and safe behavior of robots, high-speed detection of nearby and noncontact objects is important because of shorter time-to-contact. Here, we propose net-structure proximity sensor (NSPS), which covers large sensing area and fulfills 1-ms response time. NSPS is an array of infrared reflective proximity sensor elements integrated by a resistor network circuitry. Executing analog computation on the electrical circuitry, the sensing system outputs a few of meaningful signals, from the reaction distribution of all the elements. The signals mean the center position and approximate distance to the object. This sensor requires only six external wires regardless of the number of detecting elements. In this paper, we first show that various sizes of NSPS are easily configured by only using standard electronic parts. Next, we prototype NSPS with 25 elements in 5 ×5 matrix, and verify the output characteristics by experiments. At last, we discuss the availability of NSPS for robot hand systems and human–machine interface systems.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928242551

Extended pelvic lymph node dissection was also performed to moderate- and high-risk patients (86 patients). Preoperative and postoperative findings were recorded, and descriptive analyses and multivariable analyses to predict the presence of lymph node within APFP were performed.Results: Lymph nodes within APFP were detected in nine (9 %) patients. None of the patients had metastatic lymph node in APFP. Preoperatively, mean PSA levels (14.22 vs. 8.6, p = 0.0001), biopsy Gleason score (p = 0.002) and radical prostatectomy pathology Gleason score (p = 0.001) were higher in patients with lymph nodes at the APFP tissue. Pelvic lymph node metastases were detected in seven of 86 (8 %) patients. Of these seven patients, four (57 %) had lymph nodes at the anterior prostatic fatty pad (p = 0.0001). Conclusion: APFP dissection must be done regardless of the radical prostatectomy technique chosen. In our opinion, it is not necessary to do pathological examination of the APFP tissue routinely except for the patients with high preoperative PSA values, patients with high prostate biopsy Gleason scores and patients at high risk in order to save time and cost. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Anterior prostatic fat pad; Extended lymph node dissection; Lymph node dissection; Prostate cancer; Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928155203

In this complex system, the key is to optimally allocate tasks comprising of high-risk and low-risk information at multiple-levels in order to maximize effectiveness of the entire system given the limited resources. A multi-level programming model is developed in which an agent allocates information received from multiple robots to multiple team leaders who in turn distribute information to operators within their teams. The objective of the agent is to optimally allocate tasks to multiple team leaders to maximize the overall system performance and to minimize the processing cost and time while considering human factors. The developed model is solved using backward induction and details are presented in reverse time sequence. If human factors are included along with the productivity metrics then the performance of the multi-human multi-robot interaction systems can be improved. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Human-machine interaction; Multi-level programming; Optimization; Resource allocation; Unmanned aerial vehicle",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928138977

A controlled trial was conducted with 85 volunteers without cognitive impairment who were 60 years old or older. Participants were first randomized into two groups. One group consisted of 48 participants who would receive cognitive training and 37 who would not receive training. The cognitive training group was randomly divided into two groups, 24 who received traditional cognitive training and 24 who received robot-assisted cognitive training. The training for both groups consisted of daily 90-min-session, five days a week for a total of 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the changes in cortical thickness. When compared to the control group, both groups who underwent cognitive training demonstrated attenuation of age related cortical thinning in the frontotemporal association cortices. When the robot and the traditional interventions were directly compared, the robot group showed less cortical thinning in the anterior cingulate cortices.

Identical self-propelled robotic boats autonomously dock together and form connected structures with controllable variable stiffness. These structures can self-reconfigure into arbitrary shapes limited only by the number of rectangular elements assembled in brick-like patterns. An O(m2) complexity algorithm automatically generates assembly plans which maximize opportunities for parallelism while constructing operator-specified target configurations with m components. The system further features an O(n3) complexity algorithm for the concurrent assignment and planning of trajectories from n free robots to the growing structure. Such peer-to-peer assembly among modular robots compares favorably to a single active element assembling passive components in terms of both construction rate and potential robustness through redundancy. We describe hardware and software techniques to facilitate reliable docking of elements in the presence of estimation and actuation errors, and we consider how these local variable stiffness connections may be used to control the structural properties of the larger assembly. Assembly experiments validate these ideas in a fleet of 0.5 m long modular robotic boats with onboard thrusters, active connectors, and embedded computers.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928248547

Ongoing research in underwater robotics intends to increase the autonomy of intervention operations that require physical interaction in order to achieve social benefits in fields such as archaeology or biology that cannot afford the expenses of costly underwater operations using remote operated vehicles. Autonomous grasping is still a very challenging skill, especially in underwater environments, with highly unstructured scenarios, limited availability of sensors and adverse conditions that affect the robot perception and control systems. To tackle these issues, we propose the use of vision and segmentation techniques that aim to improve the specification of grasping operations on underwater primitive shaped objects. Several sources of stereo information are used to gather 3D information in order to obtain a model of the object. Using a RANSAC segmentation algorithm, the model parameters are estimated and a set of feasible grasps are computed. This approach is validated in both simulated and real underwater scenarios. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","3D reconstruction; grasp specification; point cloud; shape fitting; underwater autonomous manipulation; UWSim underwater simulator",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928243266

This paper proposes a new helical milling device as an end-effector of industrial robots. The end-effector employs a direct drive rotary motor with dual-eccentric structure to achieve high position accuracy of spindle eccentricity (or radial offset), which indicates the distance between the spindle axis and the hole axis in the radial direction. In order to eliminate the adverse effects of spindle eccentric rotation, time-varying cutting force, and other uncertain disturbances during the machining process, a closed-loop servo control system is designed based on the adaptive robust control (ARC) methodology. Comparative experiments and machining experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed helical milling end-effector. Compared with the PID and deterministic robust control controllers, the ARC controller guarantees higher accuracy of the spindle eccentricity in the presence of parametric uncertainties and uncertain disturbances. Average errors and maximum errors of the spindle eccentricity stay below 0.5 and 1.6 μm when machining holes with the eccentricity ranging from 0.5 to 4 mm, respectively. Surface roughness Ra and roundness of the machined holes in Ti-alloy and carbon fiber reinforced plastic materials are all below 3.2 and 7 μm, respectively. The results show that the proposed helical milling end-effector is suitable for hole-machining tasks in aircraft assembly applications.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928243343

Compared to LiDAR systems, the inexpensive vision sensors can capture the 3D scene as perceived by a driver in terms of appearance and depth cues. Indeed, providing 3D image understanding capabilities to vehicles is an essential target in order to infer scene semantics in urban environments. One of the challenges that arises from the navigation task in naturalistic urban scenarios is the detection of road participants (e.g., cyclists, pedestrians and vehicles). In this regard, this paper tackles the detection and orientation estimation of cars, pedestrians and cyclists, employing the challenging and naturalistic KITTI images. This work proposes 3D-aware features computed from stereo color images in order to capture the appearance and depth peculiarities of the objects in road scenes. The successful part-based object detector, known as DPM, is extended to learn richer models from the 2.5D data (color and disparity), while also carrying out a detailed analysis of the training pipeline. A large set of experiments evaluate the proposals, and the best performing approach is ranked on the KITTI website. Indeed, this is the first work that reports results with stereo data for the KITTI object challenge, achieving increased detection ratios for the classes car and cyclist compared to a baseline DPM. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","3D-aware features; DPM; KITTI; Object recognition; Stereo-vision","Sivaraman, S., Trivedi, M.M., Looking at Vehicles on the Road: A Survey of Vision-Based Vehicle Detection, Tracking, and Behavior Analysis (2013) IEEE Trans.

Therefore, compact structures able to perform multiple functions are required. The robots must have high velocities, long cruising times, and large load capacities. It is difficult to meet all these requirements using a conventional underwater micro-robot, so we previously proposed an amphibious spherical father–son robot system that includes several micro-robots as son robots and an amphibious spherical robot as a father robot. Our father robot was designed to carry and power the son robots. This paper discusses improvements to the structure and mechanism of the father robot, which was designed to have a spherical body with four legs. Based on recent experiments in different environments, we have improved the father robot by adding four passive wheels, and we have redesigned its structure by means of three-dimensional printing technology, resulting in greatly improved velocity and stability. Moreover, due to the complexity and uncertainty of many underwater environments, it is essential for the father robot to have adequate structural strength. We analyzed the movement mechanisms and structural strength using finite element analysis to obtain the deformation and equivalent stress distributions of the improved robot. The results provide support for further analysis of the structural strength and optimal design of our amphibious spherical father robot. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928150380

The uncertain nonlinear system is first approximated by Takagi and Sugeno’s (T–S) fuzzy model. To achieve a better tracking, an extra state (error of tracking) is then augmented to the T–S model. Based on each local linear subsystem with augmented state, a regional pole-placement state feedback H<inf>2</inf>/H<inf>∞</inf> controller is properly designed via linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. Parallel Distributed Compensation (PDC) is also used to establish the whole controller for the overall system and the total linear system is obtained by using the weighted sum of the local linear systems. A fuzzy weighted online computation (FWOC) component is employed to update fuzzy weights in real time for different operating points of the system. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller like robustness and good load disturbance attenuation and accurate tracking, even in the presence of parameter variations and also load disturbances on the motor and the tool. The superiority of the proposed control scheme is finally highlighted in comparison with the Quantitative feedback theory (QFT) controller, the QFT controller of order 13, a polynomial controller and the so-called linear sliding-mode controller methods. © 2015 Indian Academy of Sciences","flexible robot manipulator; FWOC component; LMI; PDC; Robust H<inf>2</inf>/H<inf>∞</inf> control; T–S fuzzy model",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928157123

The major problem with teleoperation systems is complex dynamic and subsequently designing the controller. This essay presents a novel method of controller design, based on singular perturbation framework for the bilateral teleoperation of nonlinear robots through the Internet. Using this method makes it much easier to design the controller because controller designing is done for reduced-order subsystem not full-order system. In this paper, teleoperation system dynamics was decomposed into slave (slow subsystem) and error (fast subsystem, different from master and slave), which contains position and velocity, and an adaptive sliding mode controller was designed for each of them. For constant and time-varying delay, the positions of master–slave were compared together and controlling signal was applied to the slave; therefore, they could track each other in the shortest possible time. In the simulation, the stability and performance results of teleoperation system were obtained under the proposed controller and compared with those of another approach. In this research, having higher speed and lower control signal amplitude, at the same time, elucidates the absolute superiority of the new approach. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Adaptive sliding mode controller; Nonlinear teleoperation systems; Singular perturbation; Time-delay",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928157274

Although the system with the controller has an infinite number of equilibria due to the nonholonomic constraint, those equilibria except the critical points of the potential function are unstable because of a skew-symmetric component of the controller. When the potential function has critical points of saddle type, the saddles may be stable equilibria in addition to the stable equilibrium at the minimum of the function. The controller is applied to a two-wheeled mobile robot among obstacles and modified by using a time-varying potential function in order to avoid convergence to the saddles. As a result, with the controller, the mobile robot converges to a desired position and orientation without collision with obstacles. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Feedback control; Lyapunov stability; Nonholonomic system; Potential field method",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928157729

This paper proposes to discuss and analyse the use of educational robotics to develop spatial abilities in 12 year old students. First of all, a course to introduce robotics to 6th grade primary school students was designed. The key intention was to prepare practical and motivating sessions in order to foster the students’ involvement in hands-on learning. Hence, during the sessions of the course, challenges were provided for the students, in order to develop their capabilities as proficient problem solvers. The teacher assisted and guided the students, and the students were encouraged to solve the problems by themselves, working in 3-members teams. The main goal of this paper is to discuss and analyse the potential usefulness of educational robotics to develop spatial abilities. To carry out the analysis, students were randomly divided into an experimental group (EG), which participated in the robotics course, and a control group (CG), which did not take part in the robotics course. The extensive existing literature for spatial ability evaluation was analysed and reviewed and a pre-test and a post-test were prepared for use in the research study. Initially, the spatial ability of both EG and CG students was assessed with the pre-test. Then, after finishing the robotics course, the same sets of students were tested with the post-test. An extensive analysis of the results is provided in the paper. Results show that the positive change in spatial ability of the participants in the robotics course (EG) was greater than change evident in the students who did not join the course (CG). The improvement was statistically significant. The results also show that the overall performance of the students depends on the instruments used to evaluate their spatial abilities. Hence, this study manifests clearly the importance of the selection of those instruments. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Robotics; Spatial ability; Visualization",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928139152

A critical element of computer-guided procedures is the determination of the spatial correspondence between the patient and a computational model of patient anatomy. The current method for establishing this correspondence in robot-assisted THR is to register points intraoperatively sampled by a tracked pointer from the exposed proximal femur and, via auxiliary incisions, from the distal femur. Methods: In this paper, we demonstrate a noninvasive technique for sampling points on the distal femur using tracked B-mode ultrasound imaging and present a new algorithm for registering these data called Projected Iterative Most-Likely Oriented Point (P-IMLOP). Points and normal orientations of the distal bone surface are segmented from ultrasound images and registered to the patient model along with points sampled from the exposed proximal femur via a tracked pointer. Results: The proposed approach is evaluated using a bone- and tissue-mimicking leg phantom constructed to enable accurate assessment of experimental registration accuracy with respect to a CT-image-based model of the phantom. These experiments demonstrate that localization of the femur shaft is greatly improved by tracked ultrasound. The experiments further demonstrate that, for ultrasound-based data, the P-IMLOP algorithm significantly improves registration accuracy compared to the standard ICP algorithm. Conclusion: Registration via tracked ultrasound and the P-IMLOP algorithm has high potential to reduce the invasiveness and improve the registration accuracy of computer-assisted orthopedic procedures. © 2015 CARS","Computer-assisted orthopedic surgery; Oriented point registration; Total hip replacement surgery; Ultrasound-CT registration",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928137824

However, usually philosophical papers on the ethics of human–robot-interaction do not take into account stakeholders’ views; yet it is important to involve stakeholders in order to render the research responsive to concerns within the autism and autism therapy community. To support responsible research and innovation in this field, this paper identifies a range of ethical, social and therapeutic concerns, and presents and discusses the results of an exploratory survey that investigated these issues and explored stakeholders’ expectations about this kind of therapy. We conclude that although in general stakeholders approve of using robots in therapy for children with ASD, it is wise to avoid replacing therapists by robots and to develop and use robots that have what we call supervised autonomy. This is likely to create more trust among stakeholders and improve the quality of the therapy. Moreover, our research suggests that issues concerning the appearance of the robot need to be adequately dealt with by the researchers and therapists. For instance, our survey suggests that zoomorphic robots may be less problematic than robots that look too much like humans. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Appearance; ASD; Autism; Ethics of robotics; Robot assisted therapy; Safety; Therapy; Trust",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928136194

Since the behavior of the bone being cut changes with the tissue removal, an analytical method is proposed for modeling of varying bone dynamics, and then, it is proved that the vibration amplitude of the bone indicates its status change. During the real milling process, the vibration signal of the bone is recorded by a noncontact laser displacement sensor, and we only pay attention to the harmonic component whose frequency is an integer times of the spindle frequency of the milling device. The wavelet packet transform and the adaptive linear element are performed to estimate the harmonic amplitude from the signal to correlate milling condition. Considering that the bone vibration also varies with the milling force, the relative magnitude of the force is measured from the wavelet coefficients in low-frequency subband, and subsequently, the estimated harmonic amplitude is compensated to reduce the influence of the force. The robot milling experiments in sheep spines are carried on to verify the effectiveness of the condition monitoring procedure. The experimental results are in substantial accordance with the conclusions from the dynamic model, and thus, the robot can improve the safety of the operation with the proposed method.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928041791

These microswimmers have numerous possible applications in biomedicine, microfabrication, and sensing. One type of effective microrobot consists of rigid magnetic helical microswimmers that are propelled when rotated at a range of frequencies by an external rotating magnetic field. Here we focus on investigating which magnetic dipoles and helical geometries optimally lead to linear velocity-frequency response, which may be desirable for the precise control and positioning of microswimmers. We identify a class of optimal magnetic field moments. We connect our results to the wobbling behavior previously observed and studied in helical microswimmers. In contrast to previous studies, we find that when the full helical geometry is taken into account, wobble-free motion is not possible for magnetic fields rotating in a plane. Our results compare well quantitatively to previously reported experiments, validating the theoretical analysis method. Finally, in the context of our optimal moments, we identify helical geometries for minimization of wobbling and maximization of swimming velocities. © 2015 American Physical Society.",,"Dogangil, G., Ergeneman, O., Abbott, J., Pane, S., Hall, H., Muntwyler, S., Nelson, B., (2008) IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2008, pp. 1921-1926. , (IEEE, Piscataway, NJ), pp; Fusco, S., Chatzipirpiridis, G., Sivaraman, K.M., Ergeneman, O., Nelson, B.J., Pan, S., (2013) Adv.

The forceps manipulator has a highly simplified flexible distal joint, which is actuated by push–pull motions of superelastic wires. Pneumatic cylinders are employed for its driving system to realize high backdrivability of the flexible mechanism, enabling external force estimation without using a force sensor. For the kinematic description, we newly introduce a three-degree-of-freedom (DOF) continuum model considering expansion and contraction of the flexible joint, which allows three-axis force sensing on the forceps tip. We also developed a practical dynamic model, including linear-approximated elastic forces and nonlinear friction forces dependent on the joint bending angle. Effectiveness of the dynamic model is validated by open-loop control performance of the joint angles. The position control system is designed using a PID-based cascade controller with a feedforward compensator based on the dynamic model. Resolution of the joint angle control is 1 °, satisfying the requirement for laparoscopic surgery. An external force estimation algorithm is developed, which realizes the three-axis sensing of translational forces acting on the forceps tip. The rigid-link approximation model is also employed to treat the calculation in singular attitude, the straight position of the flexible joint. Effectiveness of the force estimator is experimentally validated using a force sensor in two cases. Estimation error is 0.37 N at maximum with a force in a radial direction, and the estimation performance using the three-DOF force estimator is much better than the one using a conventional two-DOF force estimator.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928023628

Motion recognition is widely used to map sEMG signals to the target motions. One of the main factors preventing the implementation of this kind of method for real-time applications is the unsatisfactory motion recognition rate and time consumption. The purpose of this paper is to compare eight combinations of four feature extraction methods (Root Mean Square (RMS), Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), Weight Peaks (WP), and Muscular Model (MM)) and two classifiers (Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)), for the task of mapping sEMG signals to eight upper-limb motions, to find out the relation between these methods and propose a proper combination to solve this issue. Seven subjects participated in the experiment and six muscles of the upper-limb were selected to record sEMG signals. The experimental results showed that NN classifier obtained the highest recognition accuracy rate (88.7%) during the training process while SVM performed better in real-time experiments (85.9%). For time consumption, SVM took less time than NN during the training process but needed more time for real-time computation. Among the four feature extraction methods, WP had the highest recognition rate for the training process (97.7%) while MM performed the best during real-time tests (94.3%).

This study proposes an octree-based collision detection method, called the ‘shared triangles extended octrees’, applied on virtual machine tools and virtual robot arms. The proposed scheme combines the high computational efficiency of the octree test and the high numerical accuracy of an analytical surface boundaries intersection test. In the proposed algorithm, the overlapping voxels between neighbouring geometries in the virtual mechanisms are identified using octrees, and the intersections of the triangles within these voxels are then checked. It works efficiently, with rapid generation of deformed geometry by shared triangles without using decomposition. The proposed collision detection scheme is implemented on virtual machine tools and the virtual robot arms in a virtual manufacturing cell. The virtual machine tools and virtual robot arms are composed of component trees, which describe the kinematic relation between components. The necessity to check for collisions between each component is indicated by a Boolean matrix. The pairs of components selected by the Boolean matrix are checked using the proposed shared triangles extended octree method. The proposed collision detection method is an efficient tool for verifying the manipulation of CNC machine tools and robot arms and is of great help to CAD/CAM engineers and manufacturing engineers and operators of machine tools and robot arms. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","collision detection; octree method; virtual machine tools; virtual robot arm",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927748643

The scheme is managed by a velocity PD-like control plus impedance and a force feedback based on damping and synchronization error. A fictitious force, depending on the robot motion and its environment, is used to avoid possible collisions. In addition, the stability of the system is analyzed from which simple conditions for the control parameters are established in order to assure stability. Finally, the performance of the delayed teleoperation system is shown through experiments where a human operator drives a mobile robot.

This paper presents the design, simulation and experimental validation of an active anti-roll system and its associated control. The proposed system possess the advantage of having a modular design that can be installed on any off-road chassis with independent suspensions. The proposed system controls directly the roll angle of the rover which is usually uncontrollable in conventional vehicles, hence improving off-road stability while maneuverings at high speed over uneven terrain. Furthermore, the control of the proposed active anti-roll system is based on a model predictive control (MPC) for the roll dynamics, which minimizes the load transfer during cornering and the energy consumed by the actuators. The control model is based on a dynamic model of the rover and on a stability criteria defined by the lateral load transfer (LLT). Moreover, this paper presents, simulation results from the high fidelity virtual platform modeled in MSC.Adams ®, as well as, results from recent field tests demonstrating the effectiveness of a hydraulic active anti-roll system mounted on, an especially developed experimental platform, SPIDO ROBOT while cornering at a high speed reaching 8 m/s.

In the model we introduce, a team may choose one of a set of shared resources to perform a task (e.g., several routes to reach a destination), and interference is modeled when multiple robots use the same resource. We show that the general problem is NP-hard, and investigate specialized subinstances with particular cost structures. For the general problem, we describe an exact algorithm which finds an optimal assignment in a reasonable time on small instances. Aiming at larger problems, we turn two particular subinstances, introducing an two algorithms that find assignments quickly even for problems of considerable size, the first being optimal, the second being an approximation algorithm but also producing high-quality solutions with bounded suboptimality.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927740366

Typical techniques for 3D mapping using occupancy grid require intensive computational workloads in order to both build and store the map. This work introduces an Occupancy-Elevation Grid (OEG) mapping technique, which is a discrete mapping approach where each cell represents the occupancy probability, the height of the terrain and its variance. This representation allows a mobile robot to know with an accurate degree of certainty whether a place in the environment is occupied by an obstacle and the height of such obstacle. Thus, based on its hardware characteristics, it can make calculations to decide if it is possible to traverse that specific place. In general, the map representation introduced can be used in conjunction with any kind of distance sensor. In this work, we use laser range data and stereo system data with a probabilistic treatment. The resulting maps allow the execution of tasks as decision making for autonomous navigation, exploration, localization and path planning, considering the existence and the height of the obstacles. Experiments carried out with real data demonstrate that the proposed approach yields useful maps for autonomous navigation.

The main contribution is the introduction of the concepts of virtual change rate of the torque and the virtual voltage, which are linear functions in the state and control variables and are shown to be very tight approximation to the real ones. As a result, the computationally challenging non-convex minimum time path tracking problem is reduced to a convex optimization problem which can be solved efficiently. It is also shown that introducing dynamics constraints can significantly improve the motion precision without costing much in motion time, especially in the case of high speed motion. Extensive simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
