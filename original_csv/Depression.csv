As true for individuals that have experienced mild TBI, mice subjected to 50-60 psi blast show motor, visual and emotional deficits, diffuse axonal injury and microglial activation, but no overt neuron loss. Because microglial activation can worsen brain damage after a concussive event and because microglia can be modulated by their cannabinoid type 2 receptors (CB2), we evaluated the effectiveness of the novel CB2 receptor inverse agonist SMM-189 in altering microglial activation and mitigating deficits after mild TBI. In vitro analysis indicated that SMM-189 converted human microglia from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the pro-healing M2 phenotype. Studies in mice showed that daily administration of SMM-189 for two weeks beginning shortly after blast greatly reduced the motor, visual, and emotional deficits otherwise evident after 50-60 psi blasts, and prevented brain injury that may contribute to these deficits. Our results suggest that treatment with the CB2 inverse agonist SMM-189 after a mild TBI event can reduce its adverse consequences by beneficially modulating microglial activation. These findings recommend further evaluation of CB2 inverse agonists as a novel therapeutic approach for treating mild TBI. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","CB2 receptors; Deficits; Microglia; TBI; Therapy","Risdall, J.E., Menon, D.K., Traumatic brain injury (2011) Phil.

In both conditions, compliance with treatment is key to successfully treat these disorders. In the current study, we examine the effect of MDD on the compliance with ADs in patients diagnosed with co-morbid HIV/AIDS and how different classes of ADs influence compliance in this group of patients. Methods: A prospective, cohort study design was used to analyse nationally representative medicine claims data submitted to a privately-owned South African Pharmaceutical Benefit Management (PBM) company. Two groups were distinguished in the database, namely patients with only MDD and patients with both MDD and HIV/AIDS, over a six-year study period. The study population was determined by the following inclusion criteria: patients older than 18 years, MDD should be diagnosed by a psychiatrist supported by an appropriate ICD-10 code, and all patients have to be on combination antiretroviral treatment (cARV) treatment. The medicine possession ratio (MPR) was used as proxy to determine patient compliance with AD medication. Results: 127 patients (i.e. 0.24%) met the criteria of co-morbid MDD and HIV/AIDS. Females have a significantly higher prevalence of MDD and HIV/AIDS when compared to males. Patients diagnosed with both HIV/AIDS and MDD (74.43. ± 32.03, 95% Cl: 71.51-77.34) have a statistical significantly (p < 0.0001) lower compliance with AD treatment vs. MDD patients (80.94% ± 29.44, 95% Cl: 80.56-81.33), but the practical significance thereof, is low (Cohen's d = 0.2255). In this group only 26.83% of TCA had acceptable compliance compared to the 58.57% of SNRIs. Noteworthy observations were that 75% (p < 0.0217; Cramer's V = 0.0388) of venlafaxine and 28.6% (p < 0.0197; Cramer's V = -0.0705) of the paroxetine items were compliant in patients diagnosed with both HIV/AIDS and MDD. Conclusions: AD compliance is statistical significantly lower in depressed HIV/AIDS vs. depressed non-HIV/AIDS patients. However, these differences is of low practical or clinical significance, meaning that depressed HIV/AIDS patients would have missed approximately two AD doses (6.5% of a 30-day treatment period) more than the non-HIV/AIDS depressed patient over the same treatment period. © Slabbert et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Antidepressants; Compliance; HIV/AIDS; Major depressive disorder; Venlafaxine","UNAIDS World AIDS Day Report 2012; UNAIDS Fact Sheet 2012; Kaiser Family Foundation In Book UNAIDS World AIDS Day Report 2012, , http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/epidemiology/2012/gr2012/20121120_FactSheet_Global_en.pdf, UNAIDS Fact Sheet 2012; Kaiser Family Foundation.

TMD signs/symptoms and sociodemographic data were also collected. The patients were divided into seven diagnostic groups based on the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD). For statistical analysis, the patients were subsequently grouped into those with (n = 128) and without (n = 382) myofascial pain. The data were analyzed using chi-square tests, independent-samples t test, as well as stepwise logistic regression at a significance level of P < .05.RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate to severe sleep disturbance and psychologic distress was significantly higher in the myofascial pain group than in the non-myofascial pain group (P < .05). Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that sleep disturbance and anxiety were possible risk indicators for myofascial pain, with odds ratios of 2.41 and 4.10, respectively (P < .05).CONCLUSION: The Chinese population of TMD patients frequently reported a disturbed sleep condition and psychologic distress symptoms. Sleep disturbance and psychologic distress symptoms are possible risk indicators for myofascial pain in this population.",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925284623

Thus, in many animal taxa pre- as well as postcopulatory inbreeding avoidance mechanisms have evolved. An increased risk of inbreeding and hence a loss of genetic variation may occur during founder events as in most cases only few individuals establish a new population. The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a small externally fertilizing fish species subject to strong sperm competition. Sticklebacks inhabit both marine and freshwater environments and anadromous populations have repeatedly established new genetically less diverse freshwater populations. Previous studies showed that anadromous sticklebacks strongly suffer from inbreeding depression and when given the choice females prefer to mate with unrelated males. Results: The present study aimed to address whether there exists a postcopulatory inbreeding avoidance mechanism solely based on sperm-egg interactions in sperm competition experiments. We used F1 individuals that originated either from a large, genetically heterogeneous anadromous population or from a small, genetically less diverse freshwater population. For each population, eggs of two different females were in vitro fertilized by the same two males' sperm in a paired study design. In the main experiment one male was the female's full-sib brother and in the control experiment all individuals were unrelated. The results revealed that fertilization success was independent of relatedness in both populations suggesting a general lack of a postcopulatory inbreeding avoidance mechanism. Instead, male quality (i.e. sperm morphology) predicted paternity success during competitive fertilization trials. Conclusion: In sticklebacks, there is no evidence for postcopulatory inbreeding avoidance. Sperm morphology predicted paternity instead, thus sperm quality traits are under strong sexual selection, presumably driven by the high risk of sperm competition under natural conditions. © 2015 Mehlis et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Cryptic female choice; Fish; Inbreeding avoidance; Inbreeding depression; Mate choice; Paternity; Sexual selection; Sperm-egg interaction","Charlesworth, D., Charlesworth, B., Inbreeding depression and its evolutionary consequences (1987) Annu Rev Ecol Syst, 18, pp. 237-268; Michalczyk Ł., Martin, O.Y., Millard, A.L., Emerson, B.C., Gage, M.J.G., Inbreeding depresses sperm competitiveness, but not fertilization or mating success in male Tribolium castaneum (2010) Proc R Soc Lond B, 277, pp. 3483-3491; Van Lieshout, E., Tomkins, J.L., Simmons, L.W., Heat stress but not inbreeding affects offensive sperm competitiveness in Callosobruchus maculatus (2013) Ecol Evol, 3, pp. 2859-2866. , 3790535 24101978; Zajitschek, S.R.K., Lindholm, A.K., Evans, J.P., Brooks, R.C., Experimental evidence that high levels of inbreeding depress sperm competitiveness (2009) J Evol Biol, 22, pp. 1338-1345. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXmvFOkur4%3D 19344380; Keller, L.F., Waller, D.M., Inbreeding effects in wild populations (2002) Trends Ecol Evol, 17, pp. 230-241; Markert, J.A., Champlin, D.M., Gutjahr-Gobell, R., Grear, J.S., Kuhn, A., McGreevy, T.J., Population genetic diversity and fitness in multiple environments (2010) BMC Evol Biol, 10, p. 205. , 2927917 20609254; Bouzat, J.J., Conservation genetics of population bottlenecks: the role of chance, selection, and history (2010) Conserv Genet, 11, pp. 463-478; Saccheri, I., Kuussaari, M., Kankare, M., Vikman, P., Fortelius, W., Hanski, I., Inbreeding and extinction in a butterfly metapopulation (1998) Nature, 392, pp. 491-494. , 1:CAS:528:DyaK1cXisFemsrw%3D; Boakes, E.H., Wang, J., Amos, W., An investigation of inbreeding depression and purging in captive pedigreed populations (2007) Heredity, 98, pp. 172-182. , 1:STN:280:DC%2BD2s7htFSjtQ%3D%3D 17180167; Pusey, A., Wolf, M., Inbreeding avoidance in animals (1996) Trends Ecol Evol, 11, pp. 201-206. , 1:STN:280:DC%2BC3M7itFCgsQ%3D%3D 21237809; Hoffman, J.I., Forcada, J., Trathan, P.N., Amos, W., Female fur seals show active choice for males that are heterozygous and unrelated (2007) Nature, 445, pp. 912-914. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2sXhvFGitL0%3D 17287726; Huang, M.H., Caillaud, M.C., Inbreeding avoidance by recognition of close kin in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (2012) J Insect Sci, 12, pp. 1-13. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38Xks1Kjsbg%3D; Lihoreau, M., Zimmer, C., Rivault, C., Mutual mate choice: when it pays both sexes to avoid inbreeding (2008) PLoS One, 3. , 2557063 18843373; Gerlach, G., Lysiak, N., Kin recognition and inbreeding avoidance in zebrafish, Danio rerio, is based on phenotype matching (2006) Anim Behav, 71, pp. 1371-1377; Tuni, C., Beveridge, M., Simmons, L.W., Female crickets assess relatedness during mate guarding and bias storage of sperm towards unrelated males (2013) J Evol Biol, 26, pp. 1261-1268. , 1:STN:280:DC%2BC3sjgsV2rtQ%3D%3D 23745826; Tregenza, T., Wedell, N., Polyandrous females avoid costs of inbreeding (2002) Nature, 415, pp. 71-73. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD38Xkt1Omuw%3D%3D 11780118; Simmons, L.W., Beveridge, M., Wedell, N., Tregenza, T., Postcopulatory inbreeding avoidance by female crickets only revealed by molecular markers (2006) Mol Ecol, 15, pp. 3817-3824. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD28Xht1OisLrM 17032276; Bretman, A., Wedell, N., Tregenza, T., Molecular evidence of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance in the field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus (2004) Proc R Soc Lond B, 271, pp. 159-164. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2cXhvF2ks7k%3D; Brekke, P., Wang, J., Bennett, P.M., Cassey, P., Dawson, D.A., Horsburgh, G.J., Postcopulatory mechanisms of inbreeding avoidance in the island endemic hihi (Notiomystis cincta) (2012) Behav Ecol, 23, pp. 278-284; Firman, R.C., Simmons, L.W., Polyandry facilitates postcopulatory inbreeding avoidance in house mice (2008) Evolution, 62, pp. 603-611. , 18081715; Welke, K., Schneider, J., Inbreeding avoidance through cryptic female choice in the cannibalistic orb-web spider Argiope lobata (2009) Behav Ecol, 20, pp. 1056-1062; Harano, T., Katsuki, M., Female seed beetles, Callosobruchus chinensis, remate more readily after mating with relatives (2012) Anim Behav, 83, pp. 1007-1010; Stockley, P., Sperm selection and genetic incompatibility: does relatedness of mates affect male success in sperm competition?

The compound has shown promising beneficial effects in ischemic stroke models. Objective: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral levosimendan in patients with a history of cerebral ischemia. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, 16 patients with a history of ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack received oral levosimendan in 5 escalating doses from 0.125 to 2.0 mg daily for 18-day intervals of each dose; 5 patients received placebo. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory ECG and cerebral blood flow velocities using transcranial Doppler ultrasound were recorded at baseline and at the end of each dosing period. Vasomotor reactivity was assessed via the breath holding index. In addition, plasma levels of N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) and the metabolites of levosimendan were determined. Results: Levosimendan induced an increase in cerebral blood flow velocities and a decrease in NT-pro-BNP compared with placebo. There was no significant effect on breath holding index. Doses ≥0.5 mg increased heart rate by 5 to 9 beats/min. The dose level of 2.0 mg exceeded the preset safety margin of ventricular extrasystoles per hour (ie, upper 90% CI of the ratio of levosimendan to placebo above 2) with an estimate of 3.10 (90% CI, 0.95-10.07). Conclusions: Oral levosimendan increases cerebral blood flow velocities and diminishes NT-pro-BNP levels in patients with earlier ischemic cerebrovascular event. Daily doses up to 1.0 mg were well tolerated, whereas the 2.0 mg dose level induced an increase in ventricular extrasystoles.

Therefore, novel scoring systems have been developed, for instance the Kidney Transplant Failure Score (KTFS) which aims to stratify patients according to their risk of return to dialysis. We hypothesize that the efficiency of the follow-up after one year post-transplantation can be improved by adapting it to the risk of graft failure defined by the KTFS estimation. Methods/design: We propose a phase IV, open label, randomized, multicentric and prospective study. The study is registered with the Clinical Trials Registry NCT01615900. 250 patients will be allocated to one of two arms: the eHealth program versus the standard of care at hospital. In the standard group, patients classified at low-risk (KTFS ≤ 4.17) will be scheduled 4 visits at hospital per year, whilst high-risk patients will visit hospital 6 times. In the eHealth group, patients classified at low-risk will be interviewed 3 times by video conferencing and once at hospital, whilst 6 visits at hospital and 6 video conferencing will be scheduled for high-risk patients. Discussion: The current study allows to scientifically evaluate the etiologic impact of a novel eHealth program. This is important to clarify the possible contribution of telemedicine in the improvement of medical follow-up. The proposed design based on 4 different sub-groups can be interesting to evaluate other personalized medicine programs. © 2015 Foucher et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Kidney transplantation; Personalized follow-up; Randomized clinical trial; Video conferencing","Couchoud, C., Lassalle, M., Jacquelinet, C., REIN Report 2011-summary (2013) Néphrol Thér, 9, pp. S3-S6; Wolfe, R.A., Ashby, V.B., Milford, E.L., Ojo, A.O., Ettenger, R.E., Agodoa, L.Y., Comparison of mortality in all patients on dialysis, patients on dialysis awaiting transplantation, and recipients of a first cadaveric transplant (1999) N Engl J Med, 341, pp. 1725-1730; Loos, C., Briancon, S., Frimat, L., Hanesse, B., Kessler, M., Effect of end-stage renal disease on the quality of life of older patients (2003) J Am Geriatr Soc, 51, pp. 229-233; Jaar, B.G., Chang, A., Plantinga, L., Can we improve quality of life of patients on dialysis?

Recently, they have also been studied as artificial synapses for neuromorphic applications. Therefore, lots of efforts are currently devoted to optimise both materials and programming techniques to design a device able to emulate the behaviour of biological synapses, i.e. able to gradually increase and decrease its conductance when proper electrical signals are applied. In this paper, an Al:HfO<inf>2</inf> based memristor is presented as a suitable device as an artificial synapse in future neuromorphic circuits. A train of identical programming pulses was chosen because of its ease of implementation as an efficient and simple programming algorithm to emulate the strength change observed in biological synapses. With this algorithm we demonstrate that the conductance of the device can be both gradually increased and gradually decreased, provided an accurate choice of pulse amplitude and time width is made. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial synapse; HfO<inf>2</inf>; Memristive device; Resistive switching; Synaptic plasticity","Kuzum, D., Yu, S., Wong, H.-S.P., (2013) Nanotechnology, 24, p. 382001; Wu, Y., Yu, S., Wong, H.-S.P., Chen, Y.-S., Lee, H.-Y., Wang, S.-M., Gu, P.-Y., Tsai, M.-J., (2012) Mem.

Exploratory analyses of studies that used COX-2 inhibitors have demonstrated potentially superior outcome in patients in whom the urinary metabolite of PGE2 (PGE-M) is suppressed. We hypothesized that patients with disease defined by PGE-M suppression would benefit from the addition of apricoxib to second-line docetaxel or pemetrexed. Patients and Methods Patients with NSCLC who had disease progression after one line of platinum-based therapy, performance status of 0 to 2, and normal organ function were potentially eligible. Only patients with a 50% decrease in urinary PGE-M after 5 days of treatment with apricoxib could enroll. Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 or pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 once every 21 days per the investigator was administered with apricoxib or placebo 400 mg once per day. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Exploratory analysis was performed regarding baseline urinary PGE-M and outcomes. Results In all, 101 patients completed screening, and 72 of the 80 who demonstrated 50% suppression were randomly assigned to apricoxib or placebo. Toxicity was similar between the arms. No improvement in PFS was seen with apricoxib versus placebo. The median PFS for the control arm was 97 days (95% CI, 52 to 193 days) versus 85 days (95% CI, 67 to 142 days) for the experimental arm (P =.91).

However, little work has been conducted on risk factors for alcohol use in male-dominated industries. Method: A systematic review of risk factors for alcohol use in male-dominated industries was undertaken. A male-dominated industry was defined as an industry comprising predominantly male workers (i.e. ≥70%). This included agriculture, construction, mining, manufacturing, transport, and utilities industries. Searches were undertaken of major electronic databases (CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Informit, PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus), the grey literature, and reference lists of retrieved papers for English language studies published between January 1990 and June 2012. Results: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Most were cross-sectional in design. Methodological quality was assessed as moderate in nine studies and weak in the remainder. Factors associated with risky alcohol use were categorised into seven domains: demographic (being male, middle age), individual (depressed, negative life events), social norms at work (permissive drinking norms), work conditions (high workloads and job stress, low collegial support), team environment (supervisory abuse), work-home interference (using alcohol to unwind after work), and structural/socio-economic (lower SES workers), with some attenuation by income and other SES factors. Conclusion: Alcohol primary prevention strategies and future research that targets specific high risk industries are warranted to address workplace drinking norms, reduce job workloads and stress, and improve workplace support. Multi-pronged, tailored strategies are needed in male-dominated industries that reflect the needs of high risk groups as well as targeting environmental, social, and contextual factors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Alcohol problems; Alcohol use; Male-dominated industry; Risk factors; Risky drinking","Allsop, S., Pidd, K.J., Drug-related Harm in the Workplace (2001) Drugs and Work, , IP Publications, Melbourne, S.

Previous researches have reported the impacts of telomerase activity on mental illness and the potential association between NVL and major depressive disorder. To validate the susceptibility of NVL to major depressive disorder, and to investigate the overlapping risk conferred by NVL for both major depressive disorder and schizophrenia, we analyzed 9 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tag SNPs) using TaqMan® technology, in 1045 major depressive disorder patients, 1235 schizophrenia patients and 1235 normal controls of Han Chinese origin. We found that rs10916583 (P<inf>allele</inf>=0.020, P<inf>genotype</inf>=0.028, OR=1.156) and rs16846649 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=0.014, P<inf>genotype</inf>=0.007, OR=0.718) were associated with major depressive disorder, while rs10916583 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=1.08E-02, OR=1.213), rs16846649 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=7.40E-06, adjusted P<inf>genotype</inf>=8.07E-05, OR=0.598) and rs10799541 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=8.10E-03, adjusted P<inf>genotype</inf>=0.049, OR=0.826) showed statistically significant association with schizophrenia after Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, rs10916583 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=9.00E-03, adjusted P<inf>genotype</inf>=3.15E-02, OR=1.187) and rs16846649 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=8.92E-06, adjusted P<inf>genotype</inf>=8.84E-05, OR=0.653) remained strongly associated with the analysis of combined cases of major depressive disorder and schizophrenia after Bonferroni correction. Our results indicated that the NVL gene may contain overlapping common genetic risk factors for major depressive disorder and schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population. The roles of NVL in telomerase biogenesis were also highlighted in psychiatric pathogenesis. The study on variants conferring overlapping risk for multiple psychiatric disorders could be tangible pathogenesis support and clinical or diagnostic references. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Association; Major depressive disorder; NVL gene; Schizophrenia; Telomerase activity","Aviv, A., How long should telomeres be?

The results indicated that aliphatic organic matter (OM) represented the most prominent organic functional groups in the spectra, with two CH<inf>2</inf> stretching vibrations at approximately 2926 cm-1 and 2852 cm-1. The peak areas of these vibrations correlated well with the amount of total organic carbon (TOC), indicating that the OM evolution may be represented by the variation in CH<inf>2</inf> with depth. Infrared spectra obtained from samples that were heated to 105 °C, 250 °C and 550 °C suggest that the aliphatic OM consists of two fractions: combined OM and free OM. The former was more stable between 250 °C and 550 °C. This phenomenon was correlated with the H<inf>2</inf>O stretching vibration near 3300 cm-1, indicating that this OM was bonded to the clay via H<inf>2</inf>O bridges. The location of the broad H<inf>2</inf>O stretching band gradually shifted with depth from 3298 cm-1 to a higher wavenumber of 3305 cm-1, whereas the corresponding bending band shifted rapidly from 1640 cm-1 to 1605 cm-1, indicating a weakening of the hydrogen bond and a decrease in the combined OM fraction. The correlation between the diagenetic smectite illitization and the decrease in the amount of combined OM leads to the conclusion that the smectite illitization may be a driving force for the OM desorption. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the thermo-DRIFT approach for exploring diagenetic OM-clay interactions in argillaceous source rocks. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

One purpose of the current study was to examine possible sex differences in perceptions of the prevalence of cybervictimization experiences. The current study also examined whether cybervictimization accounted for additional variance in depression beyond traditional victimization and if social support would buffer the associations among traditional and cyber victimization and depression. Young men and women did not report significantly different rates of cybervictimization. Cybervictimization was significantly related to depression above and beyond that of traditional victimization. Social support was negatively related to depression. However, there was no moderating role of social support. The results of this study highlight the significant impact that traditional and cyber victimization may have on college students' well-being. Social support was also an important factor in the relation to depression, however, it did not provide a buffer in the association between victimization and depression. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Bullying; Cybervictimization; Depression; Social support","Achenbach, T.M., McConaughy, S.H., Howell, C.T., Child adolescent behavior and emotional problems: Implications of cross-information correlations for situational specificity (1987) Psychological Bulletin, 101 (2), pp. 213-232; Akbulut, Y., Eristi, B., Cyberbullying and victimization among Turkish university students (2011) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 27 (7), pp. 1155-1170; Bartlett, C.P., (2013) Anonymously Hurting Others Online: The Effect of Anonymity on Cyberbullying Frequency, , doi:10.1037/a0034335, Psychology of Popular Media Culture.

Psychological distance is related to the recollective experience of the memory, but people with PTSD and depression remember positive and negative events differently. Whereas people with depression tend to have over-general memory, people with PTSD often relive traumatic experiences (i.e., intrusive memories). These findings suggest that people with PTSD might feel close to negative events and that people with depression might feel distant from positive events. Method In the present study, students (N = 103) reported their PTSD and depression symptoms and the psychological distance of highly positive and highly negative events. Results In line with previous work, participants generally felt close to positive experiences and distant from negative experiences. However, this study is the first one to show that participants with more depression symptoms feel psychologically distant from positive events and participants with more PTSD symptoms feel psychologically close to negative events. Limitations Although we did not establish whether the negative event was traumatic and whether the participants with many PTSD and depression symptoms suffered from these disorders, these limitations can be addressed in future research. Conclusions The results emphasize the important role of identifying with positive events in depression and they support the idea that PTSD is caused by the fact that the traumatic event has become central to a person's life story. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A cross-sectional study comprised 1113 persons, 400 men and 713 women, aged 21.44. ±. 2.11. years. According to Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, participants were classified as: strongly left-handed, weakly left-handed, weakly right-handed, and strongly right-handed. Noise sensitivity was measured with Weinstein's scale. Perceived anxiety and depression were measured using Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, respectively. Results: Noise sensitivity depends on one's age. Noise sensitivity increased the odds of high perceived anxiety (Odds Ratio. =. 1.031; 95% Confidence Interval. =. 1.023-1.034) and depression (OR. =. 1.030; 95% CI. =. 1.022-1.038), independently from age, gender and handedness. Being weakly right-handed and weakly left-handed was associated with higher odds of depression in comparison to being strongly right-handed. Conclusions: Noise sensitive persons were at higher risk of high perceived anxiety and depression. Weakly right-handed and weakly left-handed persons were at higher risk of depression, independently from noise sensitivity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Anxiety; Depression; Handedness; Noise sensitivity","Badzakova-Trajkov, G., Häberling, I.S., Corballis, M.C., Magical ideation, creativity, handedness, and cerebral asymmetries: A combined behavioural and fMRI study (2011) Neuropsychologia, 49, pp. 2896-2903; Belojevic, G., Jakovljevic, B., Factors influencing subjective noise sensitivity in an urban population (2001) Noise and Health, 4, pp. 17-24; Belojevic, G., Jakovljevic, B., Slepcevic, V., Noise and mental performance: Personality attributes and noise sensitivity (2003) Noise and Health, 6, pp. 77-89; Beratis, I.N., Rabavilas, A.D., Papadimitriou, G.N., Papageorgiou, C., Eysenck's model of personality and psychopathological components in right- and left-handers (2011) Personality and Individual Differences, 50, pp. 1267-1272; Biro, M., Smederevac, S., Novović, Z., (2009) The assessment of psychological and psychopathological phenomena, , Udruženje psihologa Srbije, Beograd, [In Serbian]; Bogaert, A.F., Handedness, criminality, and sexual offending (2001) Neuropsychologia, 39, pp. 465-469; Corballis, M.C., Hattie, J., Fletcher, R., Handedness and intellectual achievement: An even-handed look (2008) Neuropsychologia, 46, pp. 374-378; Dane, S., Yildirim, S., Ozan, E., Aydin, N., Oral, E., Ustaoglu, N., Handedness, eyedness, and hand-eye crossed dominance in patients with schizophrenia: Sex-related lateralisation abnormalities (2009) Laterality, 14, pp. 55-65; Denny, K., Handedness and depression: Evidence from a large population survey (2009) Laterality, 14, pp. 246-255; Dillon, K.M., Lateral preference and students' worries: A correlation (1989) Psychological Reports, 65, pp. 496-498; Dragović, M., Badcock, J.C., Milenković, S., Gregurović, M., Šram, Z., Social stereotyping of left-handers in Serbia (2013) Laterality, 18, pp. 719-729; Dragovic, M., Hammond, G., Handedness in schizophrenia: A quantitative review of evidence (2005) Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, 111, pp. 410-419; Dragović, M., Milenković, S., Kocijancić, D., Zlatko, S., Etiological aspect of left-handedness in adolescents (2013) Srpski Arhiv za Celokupno Lekarstvo, 141, pp. 354-358; Elias, L.J., Saucier, D.M., Guylee, M.J., Handedness and depression in university students: A sex by handedness interaction (2001) Brain and Cognition, 46, pp. 125-129; Fyhri, A., Klæboe, R., Road traffic noise, sensitivity, annoyance and self-reported health - a structural equation model exercise (2009) Environment International, 35, pp. 91-97; Heinonen-Guzejev, M., Koskenvuo, M., Mussalo-Rauhamaa, H., Vuorinen, H.S., Heikkilä, K., Kaprio, J., Noise sensitivity and multiple chemical sensitivity scales: Properties in a population based epidemiological study (2012) Noise and Health, 14, pp. 215-223; Heinonen-Guzejev, M., Vuorinen, H.S., Mussalo-Rauhamaa, H., Heikkilä, K., Koskenvuo, M., Kaprio, J., The association of noise sensitivity with coronary heart and cardiovascular mortality among Finnish adults (2007) Science of the Total Environment, 372, pp. 406-412; Hill, E.M., Billington, R., Krägeloh, C., Noise sensitivity and diminished health: Testing moderators and mediators of the relationship (2014) Noise and Health, 16, pp. 47-56; Job, R.F.S., Noise sensitivity as a factor influencing human reactions to noise (1999) Noise and Health, 3, pp. 57-68; Kishikawa, H., Matsui, T., Uchiyama, I., Miyakawa, M., Hiramatsu, K., Stansfeld, S.A., Noise sensitivity and subjective health: Questionnaire study conducted along trunk roads in Kusatsu, Japan (2009) Noise and Health, 11, pp. 111-117; Llaurens, V., Raymond, M., Faurie, C., Why are some people left-handed?

However, there is considerable room for improvement. The goal of this study was to begin the process of investigating the potential for improving treatment outcome via improving our understanding of learning processes. Methods Individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder (N = 20) participated in three computer-delivered CBT lessons for depression. Indices of learning were taken after each lesson, during three phone calls over the week following the lesson, and one week later. These were: (a) whether the participant thought about the lesson, (b) whether the participant applied the lesson, and (c) whether the participant generalized the lesson. Based on a predetermined list of therapy points (i.e.; distinct ideas and principles), all participant responses were coded for the number of therapy points they thought about, applied, or generalized following each lesson. Results Less than half of the thoughts and applications were accurate. Generalization, but not thoughts nor application, was associated with improved depression scores one week later. Limitations The follow up period was only one week later and there was no comparison group so we cannot speak to the long term outcome of these measures or generalize to other mental disorders. Conclusions These results point to the importance of improving transfer of learning in CBT and represent a promising first step toward the development of methods to study and optimize learning of CBT so as to improve patient outcomes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cognitive behavior therapy; Depression; Learning","(2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association 4th ed.

The present study was conducted to examine whether the tendency for depressed individuals to maintain negative content in WM and to experience difficulties maintaining positive content in WM is due to negative mood (in)congruency effects during a depressive episode, or whether these tendencies are evident outside of a depressive episode. Methods: Individuals who had recovered from a depressive episode and never disordered controls performed emotion 0-back and 2-back tasks designed to assess biases in updating emotional content in working memory. Results: Similar to currently depressed individuals in previous studies, recovered depressed participants disengaged from happy stimuli more quickly and from sad stimuli more slowly than did their never-depressed counterparts. Limitations: Despite the extension of a depression-specific finding to recovered depressed individuals, the present study does not test whether the identified emotion updating biases predict long-term relapse or recovery. Conclusion: The obtained results suggest that a decreased ability to disengage from negative content and to maintain positive content in WM represents a trait-like cognitive style that impairs adaptive emotion regulation and may contribute to the recurrent nature of depression. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Research and theory suggest that the effect of NA on depression is mediated by brooding and the effect of PA on depression is mediated by dampening. Despite correlations among these constructs, no studies have examined joint contributions of PA, NA, brooding, and dampening on depression. The present study examined the effects of NA and PA on prospective increases in depressive symptoms, and whether effects were mediated by brooding and dampening. Hypotheses were tested in an eight-week study of 333 young adults; depressive symptoms were assessed at weeks one and eight. Participants reported their use of dampening and brooding in response to ideographically identified weekly events in weeks two through seven. Results suggest that the effect of PA on increases in depressive symptoms was mediated by use of dampening and the effect of NA on increases in depressive symptoms was mediated by use of both brooding and dampening. Future research should consider temperament traits and cognitive strategies jointly to understand the development and maintenance of depression. © 2015 .","Brooding; Dampening; Depressive symptoms; Negative affectivity; Positive affectivity","(2013) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 5; Andrews, J.A., Lewinsohn, P.M., Suicidal attempts among older adolescents: Prevalence and co-occurrence with psychiatric disorders (1992) Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 31 (4), pp. 655-662; Arger, C., Sanchez, O., Simonson, J., Mezulis, A., Section 1: Mental & physical health-pathways to depressive symptoms in young adults: Examining affective, self-regulatory, and cognitive vulnerability factors (2012) Psychological Reports, 111 (2), p. 335; Bardone, A.M., Moffitt, T.E., Caspi, A., Dickson, N., Silva, P.A., Adult mental health and social outcomes of adolescent girls with depression and conduct disorder (1996) Development and Psychopathology, 8 (4), pp. 811-829; Belsky, J., Hsieh, K.H., Crnic, K., Infant positive and negative emotionality: One dimension or two?

However, research is lacking on associations between attentional biases to positive and threat-related stimuli, attentional control and trait resilience. Methods Data stem from the follow-up assessment of a longitudinal study investigating mental health and related factors among German soldiers. Trait resilience was assessed with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and attentional control with the Attentional Control Scale. A subset of n = 198 soldiers also completed a dot probe task with happy, neutral and threatening faces. Results Attentional control was positively related to trait resilience. Results revealed no associations between both attentional biases and trait resilience. However, there was a negative association between attentional bias to threat and trait resilience when attentional control was low and a positive association between attentional bias to threat and trait resilience when attentional control was high. No such associations were found for attentional bias to positive stimuli. Limitations Generalizability to other populations may be limited since we exclusively focused on male soldiers. Also, the cross-sectional design does not allow for causal conclusions. Conclusions Findings suggest that attentional processing may promote trait resilience. Future research on preventive interventions should consider these findings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While cellular compartments of this syndrome have been well characterized, the contribution of humoral immune mechanisms and particularly immunoglobulins to SIDS has not been investigated so far. Methods: We determined serum immunoglobulin levels and infectious complications at several time points in 159 ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients. Additionally, findings were verified in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model. A novel immunoassay was established to analyze the IgG excretion ratio in mice. Results: We identified a transient IgG reduction in patients suffering from substantial ischemic or hemorrhagic brain injuries. The IgG-reduction was associated with subsequent bacterial infections. Similarly, transient hypogammaglobulinemia was detected in a murine stroke model. We then used this animal model to further distinguish the mechanism of the IgG reduction by an IgG transfer paradigm. Excretional loss rather than deficient production of IgG was demonstrated to underlay hypogammaglobulinemia. Conclusions: This is the first report of transient hypogammaglobulinemia after ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke suggesting involvement in infectious complications. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","IgG deficiency; Immunosuppression; Post-stroke infection; Stroke; Translational research","Balami, J.S., Chen, R.L., Grunwald, I.Q., Buchan, A.M., Neurological complications of acute ischaemic stroke (2011) Lancet Neurol., 10, pp. 357-371; Compagno, N., Malipiero, G., Cinetto, F., Agostini, C., Immunoglobulin replacement therapy in secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (2014) Front.

Self-reported questionnaires, including Big Five Inventory, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Rosenberg's Self-Esteem scale, and socio-demographic section were distributed to 2000 undergraduate medical students at four medical colleges and universities in Liaoning province, China, in June 2014. 1738 students became the final subjects. After adjustment for age and gender, agreeableness (β= -0.329) and openness (β= -0.096) were negatively related to depressive symptoms, while neuroticism (β= 0.245) was positively related to the symptoms. Self-esteem functioned as a mediator in the relationship between agreeableness (a*. b= -0.154, 95% CI: -0.182, -0.127)/openness (a*. b= -0.097, 95% CI: -0.124, -0.069)/neuroticism (a*. b= 0.031, 95% CI: 0.007, 0.058) and depressive symptoms. Therefore, identifying at-risk students and undertaking appropriate intervention strategies that focus on both personality traits and self-esteem may be effective in preventing and reducing depressive symptoms among Chinese medical students. © 2015.","Big five personality traits; Depressive symptoms; Medical students; Self-esteem","Beck, A.T., (1967) Depression: Clinical, experimental, and theoretical aspects, , Harper & Row, New York, NY; Becker, S.P., Langerg, J.M., Luebbe, A.M., Dvorsky, M.R., Flannery, A.J., Sluggish cognitive tempo is associated with academic functioning and internalizing symptoms in college students with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (2014) Journal of Clinical Psychology, 70, pp. 388-403; Bienvenu, O.J., Nestadt, G., Samuels, J.F., Costa, P.T., Howard, W.T., Eaton, W.W., Phobic, panic and major depressive disorders and the five-factor model of personality (2001) Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 189, pp. 154-161; Bogg, T., Vo, P.T., Openness, neuroticism, conscientiousness, and family health and aging concerns interact in the prediction of health-related Internet searches in a representative U.S. sample (2014) Frontiers in Psychology, 5, p. 370; Bunevicius, A., Kakkute, A., Bunevicius, R., Symptoms of anxiety and depression in medical students and in humanities students: Relationship with big-five personality dimensions and vulnerability to stress (2008) International Journal of Social Psychiatry, 54, pp. 494-501; Cai, H., Wu, Q., Brown, J.D., Is self-esteem a universal need?

The present study aims at testing the specific contribution of two components of mindfulness -attention to cognitive experience (metacognition) and awareness of interoceptive sensations (metainteroception)- in the treatment of chronic worry. Method Forty five female university students with high scores in the Penn State Worry Questionnaire were split into three groups: a mindfulness cognitive training group, a mindfulness interoceptive training group, and a non-intervention control group. Participants were assessed before and after the intervention using physiological indices of autonomic regulation (skin conductance, heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia) and self-report indices of mindfulness and clinical symptoms (chronic worry, depression, positive and negative affect, and perceived stress). Results Both mindfulness training groups showed significant improvement after the intervention in self-report indices of mindfulness and clinical symptoms. However, the interoceptive training group was superior in also showing significant improvement in the physiological indices of autonomic regulation. Limitations The relatively small sample size may have increased the probabilities of type I and II errors. Our Intervention program was relatively short. The participants were all female. Conclusions These results support the hypothesis that, in the context of treating chronic worry, the interoceptive and cognitive components can be somewhat dissociated and that, when both components are applied separately, compared to a non-intervention condition, the interoceptive component is more effective. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Approximately one fifth of the sample indicated that they had engaged in sexting when they did not want to. Those who had been coerced into sexting had usually been coerced by subtler tactics (e.g.; repeated asking and being made to feel obligated) than more severe forms of coercion (e.g.; physical threats). Nevertheless, the trauma related to these acts of coercion both at the time they occurred and now (looking back) were greater for sexting coercion than for physical sex coercion. Moreover, women noted significantly more trauma now (looking back) than at the time the events occurred for sexting coercion. Additionally, those who experienced more instances of sexting coercion also endorsed more symptoms of anxiety, depression, and generalized trauma. Finally, sexting coercion was related to both physical sex coercion and intimate partner violence, which suggests that sexting coercion may be a form of intimate partner violence, providing perpetrators with a new, digital route for physical and sexual covictimization. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Intimate partner violence; Mental health; Sexting; Sexting coercion; Trauma; Young adults","Agardh, A., Tumwine, G., Asamoah, B.O., Cantor-Graae, E., The invisible suffering: Sexual coercion, interpersonal violence, and mental health - A cross-sectional study among university students in South-Western Uganda (2012) PLoS ONE, 7 (12), pp. 1-9; AP-MTV Digital Abuse Study, , http://www.athinline.org/MTV-AP_Digital_Abuse_Study_Executive_Summary.pdf, Associated Press & MTV (2009, September 23) Executive Summary; Benotsch, E.G., Snipes, D.J., Martin, A.M., Bull, S.S., Sexting, substance use, and sexual risk behavior in young adults (2013) Journal of Adolescent Health, 52, pp. 307-313; Briere, J., Runtz, M., The Trauma Symptom Checklist (TSC-33): Early data on a new scale (1989) Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 4, pp. 151-163; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Methods A cross-sectional study was performed using data from the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons (NESDO). A total of 341 participants diagnosed with a depressive disorder, and 125 non-depressed participants were included. Depression diagnosis was confirmed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Emotional and social loneliness were assessed using the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Socio-demographic variables, social support variables, depression characteristics (Inventory of Depressive Symptoms), cognitive functioning (Mini Mental State Examination) and personality factors (the NEO- Five Factor Inventory and the Pearlin Mastery Scale) were considered as possible explanatory factors or confounders. (Multiple) logistic regression analyses were performed. Results Depression was strongly associated with emotional loneliness, but not with social loneliness. A higher sense of neuroticism and lower sense of mastery were the most important explanatory factors. Also, we found several other explanatory and confounding factors in the association of depression and emotional loneliness; a lower sense of extraversion and higher severity of depression. Limitations We performed a cross-sectional observational study. Therefore we cannot add evidence in regard to causation; whether depression leads to loneliness or vice versa. Conclusions Depression in older persons is strongly associated with emotional loneliness but not with social loneliness. Several personality traits and the severity of depression are important in regard to the association of depression and emotional loneliness. It is important to develop interventions in which both can be treated. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, depression shows considerable heterogeneity in its course over time. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between parent depression symptom trajectories and (i) quality of life and social impairment and (ii) psychiatric disorder and depression symptoms in their offspring. Method Participants were from a longitudinal study of 337 parents with recurrent MDD and their adolescent offspring. Families were assessed on three occasions over four years. Parent depressive symptoms and current MDD diagnosis were assessed using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry. Adult quality of life and social impairment were derived from the EuroQol and current employment status. Psychiatric outcomes in offspring were assessed using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment. Results Using latent class growth analysis, three distinct classes of parental depression symptoms were identified (asymptomatic, mild, and chronic high). Parent depression classes were associated with their own quality of life and social impairment, and with psychiatric disorder and depression symptoms in their offspring. Limitations (i) We were unable to test associations with specific offspring disorders, (ii) we did not address the direction of effects underlying associations, and (iii) the sample consisted primarily of mothers and findings may not generalise to depressed fathers. Conclusion Longitudinal assessments of depressive symptoms in parents could help to identify families who are most in need of early intervention. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Patients who spend the majority of their time in episodes of depression rather than mania are often misdiagnosed with unipolar depression (UD) that only exhibits depressive episodes. It would be important to explore the construction of more objective biomarkers which can be used to more accurately differentiate BD and UD. Methods The effective connectivity model of BD and UD in the default mode network (DMN) was constructed based on resting-state fMRI data of 17 BD (32.12±8.57 years old) and 17 UD (32.59±9.77 years old) patients using a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM). The effective connectivity differences were obtained by conducting a permutation test. Results The following connections were stronger in the BD group than in the UD group: medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) →posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), right inferior parietal cortex (rIPC)→left hippocampus (lHC) and rIPC→right insula (rInsula). In contrast, the following connections were weak or unapparent in the BD group: MPFC→lHC, rHC→MPFC, rHC→rInsula and rInsula→lHC. Limitations First, the medication effect is a confounding factor. Second, as with most fMRI studies, the subjects' thoughts during imaging are difficult to control. Conclusions The brain regions in these altered connections, such as the HC, insula, MPFC and IPC, all play important roles in emotional processing, suggesting that these altered connections may be conducive to better distinguish between BD and UD. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Objective To identify the presence of sexual dysfunction, considering the different possible domains and to evaluate its relationship with the presence of symptoms of anxiety and depression in women with arterial hypertension. Methodology One hundred fifty seven women (from 56.4 years) with a diagnosis of arterial hypertension were evaluated with media through the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results High rates of sexual dysfunction were detected in the women evaluated, and this dysfunction was in all domains as follows: desire (68.2%), excitement (68.2%), lubrication (41.1%), orgasm (55.4%), satisfaction (66.42%) and pain (56.1%). Elevated rates of symptoms of anxiety (43.3%) and depression (26.8%) were also found in our sample. Nevertheless, in the present study, such symptoms showed no relationship with sexual dysfunction levels for any of the domains assessed. Conclusion Hypertensive patients exhibit an elevated presence of sexual dysfunction, as well as anxious and depressive symptoms. Although the literature on female sexuality indicates influences of these symptoms on sexual functions, this study did not identify such a relationship in the studied population. Sexuality is an important element in patient quality of life, and a broad understanding of female sexual function is fundamental for good follow-up in these patients. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our aim is to evaluate Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Catalase (CAT) activities in BID. Methods 73 BID patients and 73 healthy controls were enrolled. Patients were classified into manic, depressive and euthymic state. Serum MPO and CAT were measured in both patients and controls. Results CAT activity was significantly lower in controls than manic, depressive and euthymics (p<0.001). MPO activity was significantly higher in controls compared to euthymics (p=0.007) and it was significantly higher in depressives compared to euthymics (p=0.023). CAT was negatively and MPO was positively correlated with disease duration in overall the patients. Positive Predictive Value was 94.5% and Negative Predictive Value was 100% above the cutoff point for CAT activity. Conclusion MPO and CAT activities are impaired in BID, which may be associated with oxidative stress and inflammation.","Bipolar disorder; Catalase; Depression; Mania; Myeloperoxidase; Oxidative stress","Aebi, H., Catalase Hans-UIrich Bergmeyer (1974) Methods of enzymatic analysis, pp. 673-680. , Academic Press New York; Akdemir, A., Türkçapar, M.H., Örsel, S.D., Demirergi, N., Dag, I., Özbay, M.H., Reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (2001) Compr.

A few previous studies suggested that consuming ACDW may be associated with elevated risk for depression. Aim Since depression is the most relevant risk factor for suicide, we hypothesized that consumption of ACDW may be also associated with suicide. Method To investigate this, we compared the age-standardized suicide rates (SSR) of 1639 Hungarian settlements with low (≥10 μg/l), intermediate (11-30 μg/l), high (31-50 μg/l) and very high (≤51 μg/l) levels of arsenic in drinking water. Result We found a positive association between SSR and consumption of ACDW. Limitations (1) we used aggregated (i.e., non-individual) data; (2) we have not adjusted our model for important medical and socio-demographic determinants of suicidal behavior; (3) we had no data on differences in bottled water consumption between settlements. Conclusions Our results indicate that in addition to its well-known adverse health effects, consumption of ACDW may also be associated with suicidal behavior. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, only very limited studies has investigated alterations of cortisone levels in stress-related mental disorder such as PTSD. The present study investigated the associations between PTSD symptomatology and hair cortisone levels which can reflect cumulative cortisone secretion over prolonged periods of time and is more robust to the influence of situational confounding. Methods Participants included 201 females who experienced 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and lost their children during the disaster. PTSD symptoms were assessed with the PTSD Checklist (PCL), and depression symptoms with the Center for epidemiological studies depression scale (CES-D). Hair cortisone levels were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer. Results The results indicated that although hair cortisone secretion could not distinguish traumatized individuals with and without PTSD, it was uniquely linked to dysphoric arousal symptoms, a key aspect of the complex PTSD phenotype Limitations A sample of females exposed to specific traumatic events was used, and PTSD was assessed using a self-reported measure. Conclusions The findings provide preliminary evidence supporting the critical role of long-term cortisone changes in the development and maintenance of PTSD symptoms, and add to extant knowledge on the neuroendocrinological underpinnings of posttraumatic psychopathology. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Design: In this randomised trial, 172 patients received 24 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2a 135 μg/week plus ribavirin 200 mg/day (n=86) or peginterferon alfa-2a 135 μg/week (n=86). The efficacy and safety endpoints were sustained virological response (SVR) rate and adverse event (AE)-related withdrawal rate. Results: Compared with monotherapy, combination therapy had a greater SVR rate (74% vs 44%, relative risk (RR): 1.68 [95% CI 1.29 to 2.20]; p<0.001). The beneficial effect of combination therapy was more pronounced in patients with baseline viral load ≥800 000 IU/mL than those with baseline viral load <800 000 IU/mL (RR: 3.08 [95% CI 1.80 to 5.29] vs RR: 1.11 [95% CI 0.83 to 1.45]; interaction p=0.001). Patients receiving combination therapy were more likely to have a haemoglobin level of <8.5 g/dL (70% vs 8%, risk difference (RD): 62% [95% CI 50% to 73%]; p<0.001) and required a higher dosage [mean: 13 417vs 6667 IU/week, p=0.027] of epoetin β to manage anaemia than those receiving monotherapy. The AE-related withdrawal rates were 6% and 3% in combination therapy and monotherapy groups, respectively (RD: 2% [95% CI -4% to 9%]). Conclusions: In treatment-naive haemodialysis patients with HCV-2 infection, combination therapy with peginterferon plus low-dose ribavirin achieved a greater SVR rate than peginterferon monotherapy. Most haemodialysis patients can tolerate combination therapy.",,"Berenguer, M., Treatment of chronic hepatitis C in hemodialysis patients (2008) Hepatology, 48, pp. 1690-1699; Martin, P., Fabrizi, F., Hepatitis C virus and kidney disease (2008) J Hepatol, 49, pp. 613-624;

Hair cortisol and cortisone have been associated to physiological and psychological strains, anxiety and depression. Hair is a very complex matrix, which might jeopardize analyte detection at low concentrations. A new, highly selective and sensitive method based on fragments of second order, MS3 (MS/MS/MS), was developed and validated for the analysis of hair cortisol and cortisone. An online solid phase extraction was performed on a C8 restricted access material (RAM) phase following by separation on a reversed-phase C18 column using methanol and 0.02% ammonium hydroxide as mobile phase. The developed method required minimal sample preparation and the injection of only 50 μL of sample leading to a LOQ of 2 pg mg-1. Good linear responses were observed in the range 2-200 pg mg-1 (R2&gt;0.99) and extraction recoveries ranged between 77-125% and 70-123% for cortisol and cortisone, respectively. Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were between 1.4 and 14%. In order to evaluate the applicability of the method, preliminary tests (N=33) were conducted in 3 cm hair samples (close to scalp) of healthy volunteers with an age range of 4-63. Average concentrations in hair were 12.7±14 pg mg-1 and 41.6±42 pg mg-1 for cortisol and cortisone, respectively. Further investigations on cortisol and cortisone as biomarkers for chronic psychological strain will be assessed as a next step. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Cortisol; Cortisone; Hair analysis; LC-MS3; Stress biomarker","Russell, E., Koren, G., Rieder, M., Van Uum, S., (2012) Psychoneuroendocrinology, 37, pp. 589-601; Xie, Q., Gao, W., Li, J., Qiao, T., Jin, J., Deng, H., Lu, Z., (2011) Clin.

Method This cross-sectional survey included 265 female college students from four U.S. universities. Students completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Problematic and Risky Internet Use Screening Scale (PRIUSS) and self-reported daily Internet use. Analyses included multivariate analysis of variance and Poisson regression. Results Participants reported mean age of 20.2 years (SD = 1.7) and were 84.9% Caucasian. The mean PHQ-9 score was 5.4 (SD = 4.6); the mean PRIUSS score was 16.4 (SD = 11.1). Participants' risk for PIU increased by 27% with each additional 30 min spent online using a computer (RR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.14-1.42, p <.0001). Risk for PIU was significantly increased among those who met criteria for severe depression (RR = 8.16 95% CI: 4.27-15.6, p <.0001). The PHQ-9 items describing trouble concentrating, psychomotor dysregulation and suicidal ideation were most strongly associated with PIU risk. Conclusions The positive relationship between depression and PIU among female college students supports screening for both conditions, particularly among students reporting particular depression symptoms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The relationship between childhood trauma and obesity may be related to the association of childhood trauma and risk for emotional eating. One pathway between trauma exposure, psychopathology, and emotional eating may be through emotion dysregulation and depression. The current study was undertaken to characterize demographic, environmental, and psychological risk factors for emotional eating in a primarily African American, low socioeconomic status (SES), inner-city population (N = 1110). Emotional eating was measured using the Dutch Eating Behavioral Questionnaire and the Emotional Dysregulation Scale was used to assess emotion regulation. The Beck Depression Inventory and the modified PTSD Symptom Scale were used to assess depression and PTSD, respectively. Higher levels of emotional eating were associated with body mass index, income, childhood and adulthood trauma exposure, depressive and PTSD symptoms, negative affect and emotion dysregulation. Childhood emotional abuse was the most associated with emotional eating in adulthood. Hierarchical linear regression and mediation analyses indicated that the association between childhood trauma exposure (and emotional abuse specifically) and emotional eating was fully mediated by depression symptoms and emotion dysregulation, with emotional dysregulation contributing more to the mediation effect. Together these findings support a model in which obesity and related adverse health outcomes in stress- and trauma-exposed populations may be directly related to self-regulatory coping strategies accompanying emotion dysregulation. Our data suggest that emotion dysregulation is a viable therapeutic target for emotional eating in at-risk populations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Childhood adversity; Depression; Emotion regulation; Emotional eating; PTSD","Adam, T.C., Epel, E.S., Stress, eating and the reward system (2007) Physiology and Behavior, 91, pp. 449-458; Aldao, A., Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Schweizer, S., Emotion-regulation strategies across psychopathology.

Current treatments comprise moderately efficacious psychological therapies and pharmaceutical antidepressants. However, nutritional therapies are also available and are regularly sought by people with depressive illnesses and parents of depressed youths. In this narrative review, studies examining the antidepressant effects of individual nutritional supplements in child and adolescent populations are appraised. Epidemiological studies examining the relationship between nutritional status and paediatric depression, or depressive symptoms are also reviewed. Nutrients covered in this article include: omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, s-adenosylmethionine, vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, iron and B-vitamins. Although several of these nutrients present as promising treatments for paediatric depression, there is a lack of high-quality studies examining the antidepressant effects of all the aforementioned ingredients. Before nutritional treatments are accepted as validated treatments for paediatric depression, further high-quality studies are required. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Rumination, a negative thought process, however, is believed a likely candidate in the association between NA and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Moreover, a thought-provoking advance in the understanding of rumination is the identification of a two-factor structure, with 'brooding' and 'reflection' as its subtypes. Thus, the present study sought to clarify the meditational effects of brooding and reflection in the relationships between NA and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Method Self-report questionnaires tapping rumination, NA, and symptoms of depression and anxiety were administered to a sample of 77 psychiatric patients aged 30-40. Results In line with study expectations, brooding, reflection, NA, anxiety, and depressive symptoms correlated substantially with each other. Both, brooding and reflection completely mediated the association between NA and depressive symptoms; however, the relationship between NA and anxiety was not mediated by either brooding or reflection. Limitations The current study is limited in terms of its cross sectional nature, sample size, sample selection, and methods of assessment. Conclusions Despite these limitations, the present study demonstrated that a temperamental construct NA significantly predicts brooding and reflection and these in turn predict depressive symptoms but not anxiety. Thus, NA, a temperamental construct, may be more related to anxiety rather than depression. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The current study investigated whether the personality trait Sensory-Processing Sensitivity moderated the efficacy of a new school-based intervention aimed at the prevention of depression. Method: Using a two-cohort treatment/control design with one cohort serving as the control group (. N=. 197) and a subsequent cohort as the treatment group (. N=. 166) it was tested whether Sensory-Processing Sensitivity predicted depression trajectories from pre-treatment up to a 12. months follow-up assessment in 11-year-old girls from an at-risk population in England. Results: Sensory-Processing Sensitivity emerged as a significant predictor of treatment response. The prevention program successfully reduced depression scores in girls scoring high on Sensory-Processing Sensitivity but was not effective at all in girls scoring low on the same measure. Conclusions: This study provides first empirical evidence for Vantage Sensitivity as a function of the personality trait Sensory-Processing Sensitivity regarding treatment response to a school-based depression prevention intervention. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Depression;

In this paper, we report general features of this field, including geochemistry of the condensates, their origin, and migration and accumulation. General geochemistry of the condensate reflects that it is an over pressured condensate reservoir. Analytical results by newly-developed high-resolution GC×GC-TOFMS method indicate that the condensate is rich in n-alkanes from nC<inf>3</inf> to nC<inf>34</inf> and in diamondoid hydrocarbons with a high content of adamantanes. The condensate has a high abundance of aromatic hydrocarbons. The gas δ13C<inf>2</inf> values in these are -23.3‰, which is characteristic of coal-derived gases. Compared with the contents of conventional condensate oils, the BZ1 well has a high content of aromatic hydrocarbons, suggesting that the condensate is in a stage of highly mature cracking. Analyses of oil biomarkers, carbon isotopes, gas compositions, etc., revealed that the condensate is dominantly sourced from the highly mature coals of the Jurassic Qiakemake Formation in the western Kuqa Depression. This set of coal source sequences has generated large quantities of condensate since 3Ma, when the study area was subjected to a rapid subsidence with sediments over 2000m and consequently attained at the condensate-generating stage. Such condensates then migrated vertically into the Cretaceous traps along faults. Therefore, the Bozi condensate field is a typical case of large-scale oil/gas field characterized by late-stage accumulation. Multiple elements favor the formation of this large-scale condensate field. The timing of trap formation accords with that of the condensate generation (since 3Ma). The traps and source rocks are stacked vertically. Faults connect the source rock sequences and the reservoirs. The hydrocarbon charge is strong and efficient. Thick Paleogene gypsum beds act as an excellent cap rock, favoring the accumulation and preservation of the condensate. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Coal-derived hydrocarbons; Deep-buried reservoir; Diamondoid; GC×GC-TOFMS; Kuqa depression; Tarim Basin","Aguiar, A., Aguiar, H.G.M., Azevedo, D.A., Aquino Neto, F.R., Identification of methylhopane and methylmoretane series in Ceará Basin oils, Brazil, using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (2011) Energy Fuels, 25, pp. 1060-1065; Behar, F., Lorant, F., Mazeas, L., Elaboration of a new compositional kinetic schema for oil cracking (2008) Org.

However, this relationship has not been examined in late-life depression. Methods PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Cochrane were searched for studies published through September 2014. Randomized, acute phase, and double-blind studies comparing an antidepressant group with a placebo group in depressed elderly patients were included. Results Nineteen studies met all inclusion criteria. Within-group effect sizes revealed significant improvement in antidepressant groups (g=1.35, p<.000), as well as in placebo groups (g=.96, p<.000). Change in depressive symptoms assessed by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was moderated by baseline severity in antidepressant groups (Z=2.67, p=.008) and placebo groups (Z=4.46, p<.000). However, this would be expected as a result of regression toward the mean, and mean differences between groups did not increase (r=.19, p=.469) as a function of baseline severity. Limitations Limited to published data and information was only analyzed at the level of treatment groups. Conclusion Baseline severity was not associated with an antidepressant-placebo difference and placebo responses are large in the treatment of depressed elderly people. We propose a stepwise approach, i.e., to initially offer elderly depressed patients psychosocial interventions and only consider antidepressants if patients do not respond. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

By the middle of adolescence and continuing at least until age 55, females are about twice as likely to be diagnosed with depression and exhibit twice as many depressive symptoms as males. Researchers have recently begun to propose models that specify complicated relationships among variables to explain the gender difference in depression and why it emerges in adolescence. These models need to be tested empirically and new models need to be formulated based on the data that emerge. Additionally, research is needed to explore whether there are gender differences in the chronicity and recurrence of depression as well as in initial episodes and whether the models that explain the gender difference in depression during adolescence also explain the continuing gender difference in young and middle-aged adults. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Epidemiology and theories of gender differences in unipolar depression (1995) Gender and Psychopathology, pp. 63-87. , American Psychiatric Press, Inc.

In particular, attention is paid to developmental epidemiology as well as risk factors and processes that contribute to depression trajectories over time. Emphasis is placed on a developmental psychopathology perspective in which risks are instantiated across multiple systems and levels of analysis, including genetics, stress contexts and processes, biological stress mechanisms, temperament, emotion, reward, cognitive factors and processes, and interpersonal influences. These risks dynamically transact over time, as they emerge and stabilize into relatively trait-like vulnerabilities that confer risk for the increasing rates of depression observed in adolescence. Overall, this summary illustrates that considerable progress has been made recently in understanding the complex developmental processes contributing to depression. Finally, a few gaps are highlighted as opportunities for future research. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Avenevoli, S., Swendsen, J., He, J.P., Burstein, M., Merikangas, K., Major depression in the national comorbidity survey-adolescent supplement: prevalence, correlates, and treatment (2014) J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry;

One path to improve treatments for depression is to target fundamental processes that go awry in depression and to enhance new learning by adapting principles and strategies from exposure-based treatments for anxiety and fear-related disorders. I describe basic principles of exposure and emotional processing and illustrate with Exposure-based Cognitive Therapy (EBCT) for depression, how these principles can be applied, with some adaptation, to address the therapeutic targets of depression. Clinical trial data of EBCT suggest that this application might be fruitful and that the process of change might be similar to that in exposure-based treatments for anxiety and trauma-related disorders. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Hollon, S.D., Ponniah, K., A review of empirically supported psychological therapies for mood disorders in adults (2010) Depress Anxiety, 27, pp. 891-932; Cuijpers, P., van Straten, A., Schuurmans, J., van Oppen, P., Hollon, S.D., Andersson, G., Psychotherapy for chronic major depression and dysthymia: a meta-analysis (2010) Clin Psychol Rev, 30, pp. 51-62; Angelakis, S., Nixon, R.D.V., The comorbidity of PTSD and MDD: implications for clinical practice and future research (2015) Behav Change, 32, pp. 1-25. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/bec.2014.26; Brewin, C.R., Gregory, J.D., Lipton, M., Burgess, N., Intrusive images in psychological disorders: characteristics, neural mechanisms, and treatment implications (2010) Psychol Rev, 117, pp. 210-232. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0018113; Brewin, C.R., Episodic memory, perceptual memory, and their interaction: foundations for a theory of posttraumatic stress disorder (2014) Psychol Bull, 140, pp. 69-97; Powers, M.B., Halpern, J.M., Ferenschak, M.P., A meta-analytic review of prolonged exposure for posttraumatic stress disorder (2010) Clin Psychol Rev, 30, pp. 635-641; Foa, E.B., Kozak, M.J., Emotional processing of fear: exposure to corrective information (1986) Psychol Bull, 99, pp. 20-35; Lang, P.J., Imagery in therapy: an information processing analysis of fear (1977) Behav Ther, 8, pp. 862-886; Foa, E.B., Huppert, J.D., Cahill, S.P., (2006) Emotional Processing Theory: An Update, pp. 3-24. , Guilford Press, New York, NY, USA, B.O.

In this article, the authors argue for a broader perspective on disparities that encompass individual-level help-seeking processes in addition to the more traditional structural-level analyses. Cultural and contextual factors influence the entire range of help-seeking behaviors, from initial expressions and conceptualizations of distress, to perspectives on depression and depression treatment, to experiences with depression treatment.

In particular, EMA is well suited to the study of affect (e.g., positive and negative affect), affective responses to stress (e.g., emotion reactivity), and behaviors (e.g., activity level, sleep) that are associated with depression. Additionally, EMA can provide insights into self-harm behavior (i.e., suicide and non-suicidal self-injury), and other mood disorders (e.g., bipolar disorder) commonly associated with depressive episodes. Given the increasing availability and affordability of handheld computing devices such as smartphones, EMA is likely to play an increasingly important role in the study of depression and related phenomena in the future. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Ebner-Priemer, U.W., Trull, T.J., Ambulatory assessment an innovative and promising approach for clinical psychology (2009) Eur Psychol, 14, pp. 109-119; Shiffman, S., Stone, A.A., Hufford, M.R., Ecological momentary assessment (2008) Annu Rev Clin Psychol, 4, pp. 1-32; Intille, S.S., (2007) Technological innovations enabling automatic, context-sensitive ecological momentary assessment, in the science of real-time data capture: self-reports in health research, pp. 308-337. , Oxford University Press, Oxford, A.A.

The variability in treatment response across studies and individuals suggests that the efficacy of exercise for depression will be most optimal when prescribed to individuals who are most prone to respond. The present article reviews contemporary theoretical accounts and recent empirical data pointing to neuroinflammatory states and neurotrophin production as possible biomarkers of the antidepressant response to exercise. The larger exercise and depression literatures provide justification for elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and deficits in BDNF production as putative matching variables. Although there is some empirical support for these hypotheses, it is clear that this research warrants replication and extension.

One key problem in depression's clinical description is determining how persistent mood changes influence emotional reactivity to ongoing environmental stimuli. Repeatedly, depressed individuals have been observed to exhibit diminished reactivity to change in the emotional context. These observations have spawned a theory called emotion context insensitivity (ECI).

In this article, we review how depression research can be meaningfully conducted within an RDoC framework, with a particular focus on the Negative Valence Systems construct of Loss. New efforts to understand depression within the context of RDoC must seek an integrative understanding of the disorder across multiple units of analysis from genes to neural circuits to behavior. In addition, the constructs or processes must be understood within the context of specific environmental and developmental influences.

Diurnal cycles of photosynthesis and water use in field-grown soybean (Glycine max) are tied to light intensity and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). At high mid-day VPD, transpiration rates can lead to a decline in leaf water potential (Ψ<inf>leaf</inf>) if leaf hydraulic conductance (K<inf>leaf</inf>) is insufficient to supply water to intercellular airspaces in pace with demand. K<inf>leaf</inf> is determined by leaf xylem conductivity to water, as well as extra-xylem pathways that are likely mediated by aquaporin water transport proteins. When transpiration demand exceeds the maximum capacity of K<inf>leaf</inf> to supply water, high tension in the water column can cause cavitation in xylem, and these emboli-blocked xylem vessels reduce water transport and thus lower K<inf>leaf</inf>. Stomatal conductance typically remains high at mid-day for soybean, suggesting either a mid-day increase in K<inf>leaf</inf> or that photosynthesis may be maintained at the cost of leaf water status, indicative of an anisohydric water management strategy in soybean. This study examined diurnal fluctuations in K<inf>leaf</inf> and Ψ<inf>leaf</inf>, showing a mid-day depression in K<inf>leaf</inf> in a pattern closely reflecting that of Ψ<inf>leaf</inf>, indicating that K<inf>leaf</inf> depression is the result of cavitation in leaf xylem. The diurnal depression of K<inf>leaf</inf> was not prevented by growth at elevated [CO<inf>2</inf>], which lowered stomatal conductance. Diurnal transcription patterns of aquaporin genes showed that a total of 34 genes belonging to 4 aquaporin families were expressed in soybean leaves, of which 22 were differentially expressed between at least two time points. These data suggest that mid-day K<inf>leaf</inf> depression was driven primarily by cavitation at increasing xylem water tensions, but that aquaporins are also likely involved in diurnal regulation of soybean leaf water status. It is further concluded that because soybean photosynthesis is typically sustained at mid-day, K<inf>leaf</inf> even at the depressed level was in excess of that needed to sustain a stomatal conductance sufficient to prevent depression of photosynthesis in soybean. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cavitation; Diurnal; Leaf hydraulic conductance; Leaf water potential","Ainsworth, E.A., Long, S.P., What have we learned from 15 years of free-air CO<inf>2</inf> enrichment (FACE)?

Recently, computerized memory trainings have been developed to target these biases, reducing rumination and lightening depressive symptoms. This review presents three novel treatment approaches: general memory training, emotional memory training, and attention or interpretation training targeting memory processes. Results are mixed, but the computerized memory trainings that target general deficits in memory or specific emotional biases seem to be an interesting new treatment option, especially as add-ons to other interventions. However, many open questions remain. These include the mechanisms of these trainings as well as more practical aspects like the optimal number of sessions, the duration of the effects, and individual differences in trainability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Beck, A.T., The evolution of the cognitive model of depression and its neurobiological correlates (2008) Am J Psychiatry, 165, pp. 969-977; Blaney, P.H., Affect and memory: a review (1986) Psychol Bull, 99, pp. 229-246; Ellis, H.C., Ashbrook, P.W., The ""state"" of mood and memory research: a selective review (1989) J Soc Behav Pers, 4, pp. 1-21; (1997) Cognitive Psychology and the Emotional Disorders, , Wiley, Chichester, J.M.G.

However, direct empirical evidence supporting this relationship is still sparse. In order to provide direct evidence, poor sleep, severity of the ED symptoms and depression were obtained in 562 ED patients at treatment admission (T0). For 271 patients out of them, data were also available after 6. months of standard treatment (T1). Results evidence that at T0 poor sleep predicts severity of ED symptoms through the mediation of depression. Persistence of poor sleep at T1 directly predicts the severity of the ED symptoms both directly and through the mediation of depression. These findings suggest that the treatment of ED may benefit from addressing poor sleep since its presence and persistence increase comorbidity and attrition to the standard treatment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Comorbidity; Depression; Eating disorders; Mediation; Poor sleep","Arrindell, W.A., Barelds, D.P., Janssen, I.C., Buwalda, F.M., van der Ende, J., Invariance of SCL-90-R dimensions of symptom distress in patients with peri partum pelvic pain (PPPP) syndrome (2006) British Journal of Clinical Psychology, 45, pp. 377-391; Bayard, S., Dauvilliers, Y.A., Reward-based behaviors and emotional processing in human with narcolepsy-cataplexy (2013) Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience, 7, pp. 1-7; Crisp, A.H., Stonehill, E., Fenton, G.W., The relationship between sleep nutrition and mood: A study of patients with anorexia nervosa (1971) Postgraduate Medical Journal, 47, pp. 207-213; Daga, G.A., Gramaglia, C., Bailer, U., Bergese, S., Marzola, E., Fassino, S., Major depression and avoidant personality traits in eating disorders (2011) Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, 80, pp. 319-320; Derogatis, L.R., Lipman, R.S., Covi, L., SCL-90: An outpatient psychiatric rating scale - Preliminary report (1973) Psychopharmacological Bulletin, 9, pp. 13-28; Derogatis, L.R., Rickels, K., Rock, A.F., The SCL-90 and the MMPI: A step in the validation of a new self-report scale (1976) British Journal of Psychiatry, 1, pp. 280-289; Garner, D.M., (1991) Eating Disorder Inventory-2: Professional Manual, , Psychological Assessment Resources, Odessa; Haynes, P.L., Parthasarathy, S., Kersh, B., Bootzin, R.R., Examination of insomnia and insomnia treatment in psychiatric inpatients (2011) International Journal of Mental Health Nursing, 20, pp. 130-136; Horowitz, L.M., Rosenberg, S.E., Baer, B.A., Ureno, G., Villasenor, V.S., Inventory of interpersonal problems: Psychometric properties and clinical applications (1988) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 56, pp. 885-892; Keppel, G., Saufley, W.H., Tokunaga, H., (1992) Introduction to Design and Analysis: A Students Handbook, , W.H.

Study subjects (N=392) included those with PTSD and/or (stress-induced) depression, and healthy controls with and without traumas. The aim of the study was to examine the network of relations centered around plasma beta-endorphin. The network included anxiety (as a personality trait), traumatic events, pain, aggressiveness, depressive symptoms, and three clusters of PTSD symptoms: intrusions, avoidance, and hyperarousal. Beta-endorphin was represented by individual mean from 13 time points (BEmean), reflecting the total amount of the peripherally secreted hormone, and the coefficient of variation (BEvar), calculated as the ratio of standard deviation to the mean, reflecting the hormone's dynamics. BEvar correlated with all other variables, BEmean had no correlations. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine all interrelations (including their directions) of BEvar and the state/trait variables in the context of their entirety. The model revealed that hyperarousal and anxiety were the only direct agents of peripheral beta-endorphin fluctuations, mediating the effects of other variables. Traumatic events and intrusions act on BEvar via hyperarousal, while depressive symptoms, avoidance, and pain act via anxiety. Hyperarousal should be emphasized as the main agent not only because its effect on BEvar is larger than that of anxiety, but also because it increases anxiety itself (via avoidance and pain). All influences on BEvar are positive and they indicate long-term (sensitizing) effects (as opposed to direct stimulation, for example, by acute pain, anger, etc.). Relations apart from beta-endorphin are also discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Depression is a common symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, its pathophysiology is unclear. Here we examined whether 5-HT<inf>6</inf> receptors in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) involve in the regulation of PD-associated depression. Unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the medial forebrain bundle in rats induced depressive-like responses as measured by the sucrose preference and forced swim tests when compared to sham-operated rats. In sham-operated rats, intra-DH injection of 5HT<inf>6</inf> receptor agonist WAY208466 or antagonist SB258585 increased sucrose consumption and decreased immobility time, indicating the induction of antidepressant effects. In the lesioned rats, WAY208466 also produced antidepressant effects, whereas SB258585 decreased sucrose consumption and increased immobility time, indicating the induction of depressive-like behaviors. Neurochemical results showed that WAY208466 did not change dopamine (DA) levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), DH and habenula, and noradrenaline (NA) levels in the DH and habenula in sham-operated rats, and SB258585 increased DA and NA levels in these structures. Further, WAY208466 increased DA levels in the mPFC, DH and habenula, and NA level in the habenula in the lesioned rats, and SB258585 decreased DA levels in the mPFC and habenula. Additionally, the lesion did not change the density of neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1/5-HT<inf>6</inf> receptor co-expressing neurons in the DH. Compared to sham-operated rats, these findings suggest that the effects of 5-HT<inf>6</inf> receptors in PD-associated depression may be mediated through different neurochemical mechanisms, and the DH is an important site involved in these effects. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Anonymous data were collected on 5835 middle and late adolescents from six different cultural contexts, namely China, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Taiwan, and Turkey. Based on an ESEM approach, which fit the data better than a CFA, configural invariance was found for a 28-item short form of the BFI, suggesting that the Big Five model fit adequately across cultures. Findings from path analyses provided evidence that the Big Five factors explained from an average of 21% of the variance in anxiety to 26% in low well-being, net any effects by background variables. Consistent with some previous work, the study provides new evidence on the links between the Big Five and four measures of adolescent adjustment and well-being across six distinct cultural contexts. It also illustrates some of the inherent challenges of modeling the structure and psychometric properties of the Big Five in a cross-national comparative framework. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Adolescence; CFA; Cross-national; Depression; ESEM; Well-being","Aichholzer, J., Random intercept EFA of personality scales (2014) Journal of Research in Personality, 53, pp. 1-4; Arbuckle, J.L., (2011) IBM SPSS Amos 20.0 user's guide, , Armonk, NY: IBM Corporation; Asparouhov, T., Muthén, B., Exploratory structural equation modeling (2009) Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 16, pp. 397-438; Ayotte, B.J., Potter, G.G., Williams, H.T., Steffens, D.C., Bosworth, H.B., The moderating role of personality factors in the relationship between depression and neuropsychological functioning among older adults (2009) International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, 24, pp. 1010-1019; Bates, J.E., Schermerhorn, A.C., Goodnight, J.A., Temperament and personality through the life span (2010) the handbook of life-span development, pp. 208-253. , In J.

Method A non-randomized controlled trial examined the effects of an eight week intensive residential treatment program based on principles from ISTDP. Patients (N=60), who had repeated prior treatment failure for current mental disorder, sufficient dysfunction to warrant hospitalization, and evidencing capacity to take an intrapsychic perspective on own problems, were included. Outcome variables included measures of target complaints (depression/anxiety, social role dysfunction, and interpersonal distress), general symptom distress, and interpersonal functioning. Measures were administered throughout and after treatment. Change was assessed by multilevel growth curve modeling. Changes during and after treatment were compared to those reported by a sub-sample of wait-list controls taking treatment as usual (N=30). Results The treatment group evidenced significant improvements on all measures. By contrast, receiving treatment as usual while on the wait-list did not yield significant changes. Effect sizes in the treatment group were consistently large at both termination and follow-up. Fourteen months after treatment 50.0% of patients had recovered in terms of target complaints. Approximately 53.3% and 48.3%, respectively, had recovered in terms of general symptom distress and interpersonal functioning. Limitations Limitations included a relatively small sample size, inability to discern the effectiveness of separate components of the treatment program, and lack of randomization of patients to wait-list and treatment. Conclusion ISTDP-based residential treatment with an eight-week time-limit appears to be effective for alleviating common and severe, treatment resistant mental disorders. The treatment program was superior to receiving treatment as usual while on the wait-list. Participation in the program quickly reduced target complaints, symptoms and interpersonal problems for patients who, based on previous treatment experiences, were expected to fare poorly in treatment. Gains were consistently maintained or improved further at follow-up. Results are promising for patients with chronic debilitating problems who often do not profit from traditional psychiatric treatment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 510 adults with a lifetime history of traumatic events completed the Perceived Ability to Cope with Trauma (PACT), the Korea version of the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS-K), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Hierarchical regression indicated that coping flexibility was associated with a reduced level of PTSD or depressive symptoms after controlling for comorbid symptoms, age, and elapsed time since the most distressing traumatic event. The interaction of traumatic events and coping flexibility was significant only on PTSD symptom severity but not on depressive symptom severity. Specifically, individuals with low coping flexibility reported higher levels of PTSD symptoms as the number of traumatic events increased. These findings supported the hypothesis that coping flexibility is a protective factor for PTSD and depression following trauma, and lack of coping flexibility may aggravate the risk for PTSD among people with multiple trauma. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Coping flexibility; Depression; Protective factor; PTSD; Trauma","Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, , Sage; Alim, T.N., Feder, A., Graves, R.E., Wang, Y., Weaver, J., Westphal, M., Trauma, resilience, and recovery in a high-risk African-American population (2008) American Journal of Psychiatry, 165, pp. 1566-1575; Bonanno, G.A., Loss, trauma, and human resilience: Have we underestimated the human capacity to thrive after extremely aversive events?

The aim of this study was to examine the longitudinal reciprocal effects between self-esteem and depressive mood in older adults. 757 participants aged 64-97. years assessed 4 times over a six-year period. Cross-lagged models were estimated using SEM. Our findings showed a relative stability over a six-year period of both self-esteem and depressive mood. There were no cross-lagged reciprocal effects between self-esteem and depressive mood over time, thereby rejecting both vulnerability and scar models. It means that self-esteem and depressive mood do not predate each other in old age. These results suggest a developmental phenomenon in which self-esteem and depressive mood follow two parallel and stable developmental trajectories through old age. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Depression; Old age; Prospective study; Self-esteem","Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; Arbuckle, J.L., (2009) AMOS 18.0 user's guide, , Amos Development Corporation, Crawfordville, FL; Barefoot, J., Mortensen, E., Helms, M., Avlund, K., Schroll, M., A longitudinal study of gender differences in depressive symptoms from age 50 to 80 (2001) Psychology and Aging, 16 (2), pp. 342-345; Baumeister, R.F., Campbell, J.D., Krueger, J.I., Vohs, K.D., Does high self-esteem cause better performance, interpersonal success, happiness, or healthier lifestyles?

However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the augmenting effects of olanzapine are not fully understood. Here, we report that olanzapine enhances the SSRI-induced increase in extracellular serotonin (5-HT) levels and antidepressant-like effects by inhibiting GABAergic neurons through 5-HT<inf>6</inf> receptor antagonism in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). In organotypic raphe slice cultures, treatment with olanzapine (1-100 μM) enhanced the increase in extracellular 5-HT levels in the presence of fluoxetine (10 μM) or citalopram (1 μM). The enhancing effect of olanzapine was not further augmented by the GABA<inf>A</inf> receptor antagonist bicuculline. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that olanzapine (50 μM) decreased the firing frequency of GABAergic neurons in acute DRN slices. Among many serotonergic agents, the 5-HT<inf>6</inf> receptor antagonist SB399885 (1-100 μM) mimicked the effects of olanzapine by enhancing the SSRI-induced increase in extracellular 5-HT levels, which was not further augmented by bicuculline or olanzapine. SB399885 (50 μM) also decreased the firing frequency of GABAergic neurons in the DRN. In addition, an intraperitoneal administration of SB399885 (10 mg/kg) to mice significantly enhanced the antidepressant-like effect of a subeffective dose of citalopram (3 mg/kg) in the tail-suspension test. These results suggest that olanzapine decreases local inhibitory GABAergic tone in the DRN through antagonism of 5-HT<inf>6</inf> receptors, thereby increasing the activity of at least part of serotonergic neurons, which may contribute to the augmentation of the efficacy of SSRIs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is well known that brain and plasma levels of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone (ALLO) increase after acute environmental stress, fact that has been considered a homeostatic mechanism in restoring normal function following stress. Thus, it is of great interest to study the contribution of stress-altered plasma ALLO levels on PPI function. For this purpose, animals were injected with finasteride, an ALLO synthesis inhibitor, and submitted to swim stress before PPI testing. In order to obtain ALLO plasma levels, a separate set of animals that followed the same experimental procedure was used. We hypothesize that the blockade of ALLO production in response to stress can increase the stress-induced PPI disruption. In accordance with other authors, our results indicate that acute swim stress disrupted the normal PPI evolution (increase) related to the increase in prepulse intensities, and also decreased PPI at the highest prepulse intensity level (15. db above background). Finasteride potentiated the PPI decrease induced by swim stress in the intermediate prepulse intensity (10. db above background). As expected, plasma ALLO levels were increased in stressed animals and this increase was neutralized by prior finasteride administration. These results indicate that the neutralization of the physiological plasma ALLO levels increase after acute stress potentiates stress-induced PPI disruption. This data suggests that alterations in homeostatic ALLO synthesis mechanism may be linked to some neuropsychiatric disorders related to stress, such as anxiety/depression disorders. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Acute swim stress; Allopregnanolone; Finasteride; Neurosteroids; Prepulse inhibition; Sensory gating","Hauser, J., Rudolph, U., Keist, R., Möhler, H., Feldon, J., Yee, B.K., Hippocampal alpha5 subunit-containing GABAA receptors modulate the expression of prepulse inhibition (2005) Mol Psychiatry, 10 (2), pp. 201-207; Yee, B.K., Keist, R., von Boehmer, L., Studer, R., Benke, D., Hagenbuch, N., A schizophrenia-related sensorimotor deficit links alpha 3-containing GABAA receptors to a dopamine hyperfunction (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 102 (47), pp. 17154-17159; Parwani, A., Duncan, E.J., Bartlett, E., Madonick, S.H., Efferen, T.R., Rajan, R., Impaired prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle in schizophrenia (2000) Biol Psychiatry, 47 (7), pp. 662-669; Swerdlow, N.R., Light, G.A., Cadenhead, K.S., Sprock, J., Hsieh, M.H., Braff, D.L., Startle gating deficits in a large cohort of patients with schizophrenia: relationship to medications, symptoms, neurocognition, and level of function (2006) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 63 (12), pp. 1325-1335; Kohl, S., Heekeren, K., Klosterkötter, J., Kuhn, J., Prepulse inhibition in psychiatric disorders - apart from schizophrenia (2013) J Psychiatr Res, 47 (4), pp. 445-452; Swerdlow, N.R., Braff, D.L., Taaid, N., Geyer, M.A., Assessing the validity of an animal model of deficient sensorimotor gating in schizophrenic patients (1994) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 51 (2), pp. 139-154; Swerdlow, N.R., Geyer, M.A., Using an animal model of deficient sensorimotor gating to study the pathophysiology and new treatments of schizophrenia (1998) Schizophr Bull, 24 (2), pp. 285-301; Chang, C.H., Hsiao, Y.H., Chen, Y.W., Yu, Y.J., Gean, P.W., Social isolation-induced increase in NMDA receptors in the hippocampus exacerbates emotional dysregulation in mice (2014) Hippocampus; Weiss, I.C., Feldon, J., Domeney, A.M., Isolation rearing-induced disruption of prepulse inhibition: further evidence for fragility of the response (1999) Behav Pharmacol, 10 (2), pp. 139-149; Powell, S.B., Swerdlow, N.R., Pitcher, L.K., Geyer, M.A., Isolation rearing-induced deficits in prepulse inhibition and locomotor habituation are not potentiated by water deprivation (2002) Physiol Behav, 77 (1), pp. 55-64; Guercio, G.D., Bevictori, L., Vargas-Lopes, C., Madeira, C., Oliveira, A., Carvalho, V.F., D-serine prevents cognitive deficits induced by acute stress (2014) Neuropharmacology; Sutherland, J.E., Conti, L.H., Restraint stress-induced reduction in prepulse inhibition in Brown Norway rats: role of the CRF2 receptor (2011) Neuropharmacology, 60 (4), pp. 561-571; Liu, Y.P., Tung, C.S., Chuang, C.H., Lo, S.M., Ku, Y.C., Tail-pinch stress and REM sleep deprivation differentially affect sensorimotor gating function in modafinil-treated rats (2011) Behav Brain Res, 219 (1), pp. 98-104; Bakshi, V.P., Alsene, K.M., Roseboom, P.H., Connors, E.E., Enduring sensorimotor gating abnormalities following predator exposure or corticotropin-releasing factor in rats: a model for PTSD-like information-processing deficits?

A sample of binge eaters (n= 77) and a sample of non-binge eaters (n= 185) completed the following self-report instruments: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Irrational Food Beliefs Scale, Desire Thinking Questionnaire, and Binge Eating Scale. Mann-Whitney U tests revealed that all variable scores were significantly higher for binge eaters than non-binge eaters. A logistic regression analysis indicated that verbal perseveration was a predictor of classification as a binge eater over and above Body Mass Index, negative affect and irrational food beliefs. A hierarchical regression analysis, on the combined sample, indicated that verbal perseveration predicted levels of binge eating independently of Body Mass Index, negative affect and irrational food beliefs.

Typically, a composite biomaterial consists of a matrix, often a polymer, with one or more fillers that can be made up of particles, sheets or fibres. The polymer matrix can be chosen from a wide range of compositions and can be fabricated easily and rapidly into complex shapes and structures. In the present study we have examined three size fractions of collagen-containing particles embedded at up to 60% w/w in a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix. The particles used were bone particles, which are a mineral-collagen composite and demineralised bone, which gives naturally cross-linked collagen particles. SEM showed well dispersed particles in the PVA matrix for all concentrations and sizes of particles, with FTIR suggesting collagen to PVA hydrogen bonding. T<inf>g</inf> of membranes shifted to a slightly lower temperature with increasing collagen content, along with a minor amount of melting point depression. The modulus and tensile strength of membranes were improved with the addition of both particles up to 10wt%, and were clearly strengthened by the addition, although this effect decreased with higher collagen loadings. Elongation at break decreased with collagen content. Cell adhesion to the membranes was observed associated with the collagen particles, indicating a lack of cytotoxicity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bone; Cell culture; Demineralised bone; Mechanical properties; Polyvinyl alcohol; Thermal properties","Alexy, P., Bakos, D., Hanzelova, S., Kukolikova, L., Kupec, J., Charvatova, K., Chiellini, E., Cinelli, P., Poly(vinyl alcohol)-collagen hydrolysate thermoplastic blends: I.

The underlying pathological alterations in the brain are not fully understood so far. Dysregulation of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb has been recently suggested to be implicated in non-motor symptoms of PD. However, there is so far no direct evidence to support the relationship of non-motor symptoms and the modulation of adult neurogenesis following dopamine depletion and/or dopamine replacement. In this study, we investigated the long-term effects of l-DOPA and pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, in a mouse model of bilateral intranigral 6-OHDA lesion, in order to assess the impact of adult neurogenesis on non-motor behavior. We found that l-DOPA and pramipexole can normalize decreased neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the periglomerular layer of the olfactory bulb caused by a 6-OHDA lesion. Interestingly, pramipexole showed an antidepressant and anxiolytic effect in the forced swim test and social interaction test. However, there was no significant change in learning and memory function after dopamine depletion and dopamine replacement, respectively. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

There are few reports on the predictors of incident and persistent post-discharge depressive disorders in ACS. This study aimed to investigate the incidence and persistence of depressive disorder over a one year follow-up, and predictors of these outcomes. Methods 1152 patients with recently developed ACS were recruited at baseline, and 828 were followed one year thereafter. Depressive disorder (major and minor) was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria, and analyzed according to baseline prevalence, and follow up incidence and persistence. Of 446 baseline participants with depressive disorders, 300 were randomized to a 24-week double blind trial of escitalopram or placebo, while the remaining 146 received medical treatment as usual. Associations of baseline socio-demographic and clinical characteristics with depressive disorder were investigated using logistic regression models. Results Two-week prevalence, and one-year incidence and persistence of depressive disorder were 38.7%, 13.1%, and 46.3%, respectively. Baseline depressive disorder was independently associated with female, lower educational level, previous ACS and higher heart rate. Incident depressive disorder was independently predicted by current unemployment, family history of depression, higher baseline Hamilton Depression Rating Scale(HAMD) score and lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and persistent depressive disorder by higher baseline HAMD score and the placebo or medical treatment as usual group in the 24-week trial. Limitations The generalizability should be considered since this study conducted in a single center. Conclusions Depressive disorder in ACS patients is common and often persistent, and is associated with baseline characteristics and insufficient treatment. Appropriate detection and treatment of depressive disorder are clearly important in ACS patients. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Novel, epigenetic data suggest that maternal dietary intake has permanent phenotypic consequences for offspring, highlighting the potency of antenatal diet. To date, the relationship between poor antenatal diet and maternal mental health specifically, remains poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review evidence that has examined associations between antenatal diet quality and the experience of depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms during the perinatal period.

Results: Nine studies (cohort = 4, cross-sectional = 5) published between 2005 and 2013 were eligible for inclusion in this review. A synthesis of findings revealed positive associations between poor quality and unhealthy diets and antenatal depressive and stress symptoms. Healthy diets were inversely associated with antenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms. Postnatal depressive symptoms demonstrated inconsistent results. Conclusions: Given the paucity of research examining diet quality and mental health in women during the perinatal period, further sufficiently powered studies are urgently required to examine this association. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Anxiety; Depression; Maternal diet; Perinatal; Stress; Systematic review","Barker, E.D., Kirkham, N., Ng, J., Jensen, S.K.G., Prenatal maternal depression symptoms and nutrition, and child cognitive function (2013) The British Journal of Psychiatry: The Journal of Mental Science, 203, pp. 417-421; Blunden, C.H., Inskip, H.M., Robinson, S.M., Cooper, C., Godfrey, K.M., Kendrick, T.R., Postpartum depressive symptoms.

Box 8888, Station Centre-VilleMontreal, Canada","Background Through self-management, people living with depression, anxiety or bipolar disorders can play an active role in their recovery. However, absence of a validated questionnaire limits empirical research on self-management. The study aimed to develop a French instrument, the Mental Health Self-Management Questionnaire (MHSQ), and to investigate its psychometric properties Methods A pool of 86 items was created based on a qualitative study with 50 people in recovery from depression, anxiety or bipolar disorders. The 64 most pertinent items were identified following ratings from 14 experts. A sample of 149 people in recovery completed these items and criterion-related measures (specific aspects of self-management, clinical and personal recovery, social desirability), and 93 participants also completed MHSQ two weeks later Results Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses show that MHSQ is composed of three subscales: Clinical (getting help and using resources), Empowerment (building upon strengths and positive self-concept to gain control) and Vitality (active and healthy lifestyle). These subscales had satisfying consistency and test-retest reliability, and were mostly unrelated to social desirability. Correlations with criterion variables support convergent and concurrent validity, especially for Empowerment and Vitality. Comparison of structural models provides evidence of the distinct nature of MHSQ in comparison to the constructs of clinical and personal recovery Limitations Longitudinal studies with larger samples are needed to explore the validity of MHSQ for predicting recovery over time Conclusion MHSQ is a psychometrically-sound instrument, useful for establishing the role of self-management in recovery and monitoring the efficacy of self-management support programs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, little or no research to date has explored associations between NSSI and identity distress in specific domains. To address this shortcoming, we assessed NSSI, identity distress, anxiety, and depression using self-report questionnaires in 568 high school students. Gender differences in NSSI were found with lifetime prevalence of NSSI being twice as high in females as compared to males. Gender differences in terms of identity domains were also significant; adolescent females showed higher levels of distress in the identity domains of career goals, friendship, and group loyalties as compared to males. Adolescents engaging in NSSI showed higher distress in domains of long-term goals, friendship, sexual orientation and behavior, values and beliefs. Results indicated that it was not distress in specific domains as such but the impairment due to daily impact of identity distress that explained additional variance in lifetime prevalence of NSSI above and beyond gender, age, depression, and anxiety. We also demonstrated that gender differences in lifetime prevalence of NSSI were mediated by differences in such identity impairment.

It has been robustly implicated as an important mechanism in the onset and maintenance of depression, and has recently been proposed as a potential therapy target to improve treatment efficacy. I describe emerging trial research on psychological therapies that target rumination, which provides encouraging preliminary evidence that rumination-focused interventions may enhance treatment outcome, although key limitations are noted, including the lack of a definitive comparison to existing therapies. Recent advances in cognitive bias modification that implicate cognitive biases in the maintenance of rumination are highlighted as indicating that this approach has potential to treat rumination. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Responses to depression and their effects on the duration of depressive episodes (1991) J Abnorm Psychol, 100, pp. 569-582; Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Wisco, B.E., Lyubomirsky, S., Rethinking rumination (2008) Perspect Psychol Sci, 3, pp. 400-424; Watkins, E.R., Nolen-Hoeksema, S., A habit-goal framework of depressive rumination (2014) J Abnorm Psychol, 123, pp. 24-34; Nolen-Hoeksema, S., The role of rumination in depressive disorders and mixed anxiety/depressive symptoms (2000) J Abnorm Psychol, 109, pp. 504-511; Spasojevic, J., Alloy, L.B., Rumination as a common mechanism relating depressive risk factors to depression (2001) Emotion, 1, pp. 25-37; Kinderman, P., Schwannauer, M., Pontin, E., Tai, S., Psychological processes mediate the impact of familial risk, social circumstances, and life events on mental health (2013) PLOS ONE, 8; Michl, L.C., McLaughlin, K.M., Shephard, K., Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Rumination as a mechanism linking stressful life events to symptoms of depression and anxiety: longitudinal evidence in early adolescents and adults (2013) J Abnorm Psychol, 122, pp. 339-352; Watkins, E.R., Constructive and unconstructive repetitive thought (2008) Psychol Bull, 134, pp. 163-206; Riso, L.P., Du Toit, P., Blandino, J.A., Penna, S., Dacey, S., Duin, J.S., Pacoe, E.M., Ulmer, C.S., Cognitive aspects of chronic depression (2003) J Abnorm Psychol, 112, pp. 72-80; Roberts, J.E., Gilboa, E., Gotlib, I.H., Ruminative response style and vulnerability to episodes of dysphoria: gender, neuroticism, and episode duration (1998) Cogn Ther Res, 22, pp. 401-423; Ciesla, J.A., Roberts, J.E., Self-directed thought and response to treatment for depression: a preliminary investigation (2002) J Cogn Psychother, 16, pp. 435-453; Jones, N.P., Siegle, G.J., Thase, M.E., Effects of rumination and initial severity on remission to cognitive therapy for depression (2008) Cogn Ther Res, 32, pp. 591-604; Schmaling, K.B., Dimidjian, S., Katon, W., Sullivan, M., Response styles among patients with minor depression and dysthymia in primary care (2002) J Abnorm Psychol, 111, pp. 350-356; Harvey, A.G., Watkins, E., Mansell, W., Shafran, R., (2004) Cognitive behavioural processes across psychological disorders: a transdiagnostic approach to research and treatment, , Oxford University Press; Ehring, T., Watkins, E.R., Repetitive negative thinking as a transdiagnostic process (2008) Int J Cogn Ther, 1, pp. 192-2005; Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Watkins, E.R., A heuristic for transdiagnostic models of psychopathology: explaining multifinality and divergent trajectories (2011) Perspect Psychol Sci, 6, pp. 589-609; Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Stice, E., Wade, E., Bohon, C., Reciprocal relations between rumination and bulimic, substance abuse, and depressive symptoms in female adolescents (2007) J Abnorm Psychol, 116, pp. 198-207; Caselli, G., Ferretti, C., Leoni, M., Rebecchi, D., Rovetto, F., Spada, M.M., Rumination as a predictor of drinking behaviour in alcohol abusers: a prospective study (2010) Addiction, 105, pp. 1041-1048; McLaughlin, K.A., Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Rumination as a transdiagnostic factor in depression and anxiety (2011) Behav Res Ther, 49, pp. 186-193; Mennin, D.S., Fresco, D.M., What, me worry about DSM-V and RDoC?

Suicidal ideation usually precedes a suicide attempt. If prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity is a biomarker for suicidal ideation in depression, monitoring it could be useful for suicide prevention. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the association between prefrontal function and suicidal ideation in MDD. Methods Prefrontal function in 67 patients with MDD (31 with suicidal ideation and 36 without) and 67 age-, gender-, and intelligence quotient-matched healthy controls (HCs) was evaluated using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during a verbal fluency task (VFT). Suicidal ideation was assessed using item 3 of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Results Regional hemodynamic changes were significantly smaller in patients with MDD than in HCs in prefrontal and temporal regions. Hemodynamic changes in the right dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and right frontopolar cortex (FPC) regions in patients with MDD with suicidal ideation were significantly smaller than in those without suicidal ideation. In addition, hemodynamic changes correlated negatively with the severity of suicidal ideation in the DLPFC, OFC, and FPC in patients with MDD. Limitations Further studies with a larger sample size are required to verify our findings. Conclusions These results suggest that the DLPFC, OFC, and FPC are brain substrates of suicidal ideation in depressive states in patients with MDD, and that NIRS data can be employed as a clinically useful biomarker for the assessment of suicide risk. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the transverse faults in the Kuqa Foreland Basin, the most important gas producing area in China, have rarely been studied. Interpreted seismic sections and earthquake focal mechanism solutions, as well as other geological and geophysical data, allow us to identify a few widely-spaced, approximately NS trending, transverse strike-slip faults separating major structural units, and to clarify the geometry and kinematics of these transverse faults hidden below thrust faults. In the Kuqa Foreland Basin, two major structural domains can be distinguished. Transverse faults in the northern Kuqa Foreland Basin are mainly NNE trending sinistral, indicating clockwise-rotation of fault-bounded blocks. In contrast, the predominant NW trending dextral faults in the southern Kuqa Foreland Basin imply counterclockwise-rotation of fault-bounded blocks. We propose a tectonic model in which crustal blocks are bounded by strike-slip faults in a zone of simple shear rotation about vertical axis. The strike-slip faulting and thrust faulting in the Kuqa Foreland Basin suggest that some of the convergence between South Tianshan and Tarim blocks may have been accommodated not only by obvious crustal shortening and thickening along thrust faults, but also by rotation and possible lateral movement of the crust along transverse faults. Controlled by the remote collision of Indian block with Eurasian block since the Miocene, these reactivated substratum faults, which may inherit from Paleozoic deformation, control various elements relevant to gas accumulation in the Kuqa Foreland Basin which should expect to be paid more attention in the future. These elements include maturity of Tertiary and Jurassic source rocks, a difference in the regional cap of Kumugelimu salt beds from east to west, reservoir bed properties, gas migration channels, and traps formation. In addition, the strike-slip faulting of the transverse faults may affect deformation of the sedimentary cover, including making the western Qiulitag structural belt to form an arcuated structure curved to the SSW. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Deformation of sedimentary cover; Focal solution; Kuqa foreland basin; Petroleum geology; Transverse fault","Baker, C., Jackson, J., Priestley, K., Earthquakes on the Kazerun Line in the Zagros Mountains of Iran: strike-slip faulting within a fold-and-thrust belt (1993) Geophys.

Cognitive therapy (CT) aims to decrease depressive symptoms and prevent relapse/recurrence. We review prevention evidence for acute, continuation, and maintenance CTs for patients whose depression is active, remitted, and recovered, respectively. Evidence suggests that patients relapse less often after discontinuing acute phase CT versus discontinuing pharmacotherapy. Continuation CT further decreases relapse relative to inactive controls and similarly to active pharmacotherapy. Maintenance CT may decrease recurrence but needs rigorous evaluation. Post-acute CT's preventive effects appear greater for higher-risk patients (e.g., with residual depressive symptoms, unstable acute-phase treatment response, childhood trauma, more prior depressive episodes), although risks may vary by specific CTs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"(2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC; Kessler, R.C., Akiskal, H.S., Ames, M., Birnbaum, H., Greenberg, P., Hirschfeld, R.A., Prevalence and effects of mood disorders on work performance in a nationally representative sample of U.S. workers (2006) Am J Psychiatry, 163, pp. 1561-1568; Wells, K., Stewart, A., Hays, R., Burnam, M., Rogers, W., Daniels, M., The functioning and well-being of depressed patients.

Kolpochoerus olduvaiensis, Kolpochoerus majus, and Metridiochoerus modestus). These suid taxa are morphologically evolved and are found in association with a diverse large vertebrate faunal assemblage, including the genus Homo and a rich accumulation of Acheulean tools. The anatomic, biometric, morphometric and dental microwear analyses, show significant data of dietary traits, habitat and evolutionary changes. In suids, despite their omnivorous diets, microwear study can play a significant role in understanding dietary habits. The results of our study show morphological distinction between the three suid species. Conversely, the microwear patterns recorded on the dental surfaces show overlapping of ecological niches among the species. We believe that their opportunistic feeding and rapid reproduction process might have sustained their survival within the mosaic environments of the Buia Basin in competition with other faunas (other ungulates, carnivores and monkeys) and hominins. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Buia; Early Pleistocene; Eritrea; Microwear; Suid remains","Abbate, E., Albianelli, A., Azzaroli, A., Benvenuti, M., Berhane, T., Bruni, P., Cipriani, N., Villa, I., A one-million-year old Homo cranium from the Danakil (Afar) depression of Eritrea (1998) Nature, 393, pp. 458-460; Abbate, E., Beraky, W., Bruni, P., Falorni, P., Papini, M., Sagri, M., Simret, G., Tewolde, M.T., Geology of the Homo-bearing Pleistocene Dandiero Basin (Buia Region, Eritrean Danakil Depression) (2004) Riv.

There is a growing body of literature examining the impact of maternal cognitive factors (e.g., rumination) on maternal attunement and mood. However, little research has examined the role of infant temperament and maternal social support in this relationship. This study investigated the hypothesis that rumination would mediate (1) the relationship between depressive symptoms and attunement and (2) the relationship between social support and attunement. We further predicted that infant temperament would moderate these relationships, such that rumination would demonstrate mediating effects on attunement when infant difficult temperament was high, but not low. Two hundred and three mothers completed measures on rumination, depressive symptoms, attunement, perceived social support and infant temperament. Rumination mediated the effect of postnatal maternal depressive mood on maternal self-reported responsiveness to the infant when infants were low, but not high, in negative temperament. When infants had higher negative temperament, there were direct relationships between maternal depressive symptoms, social support and maternal self-reported responsiveness to the infant. This study is limited by its cross-sectional and correlational nature and the use of self-report measures to assess a mother's awareness of her infant needs and behaviours, rather than observational measures of maternal sensitivity. These findings suggest potentially different pathways to poor maternal responsiveness than those expected and provide new evidence about the contexts in which maternal cognitive factors, such as rumination, may impact on the mother-infant relationship. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Infant temperament; Maternal responsiveness; Rumination; Social support","Abbott, M.J., Rapee, R.M., Post-event rumination and negative self-appraisal in social phobia before and after treatment (2004) Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 113 (1), p. 136; Amankwaa, L., Pickler, R., Measuring maternal responsiveness (2007) ABNF Journal, 18 (1), pp. 25-30; Amankwaa, L.C., Younger, J., Best, A., Pickler, R., (2002) Psychometric properties of the MIRI, , Virginia Commonwealth University, (Unpublished manuscript); Austin, M.P., Hadzi-Pavlovic, D., Leader, L., Saint, K., Parker, G., Maternal trait anxiety, depression and life event stress in pregnancy: Relationships with infant temperament (2005) Early Human Development, 81 (2), pp. 183-190; Barnum, S.E., Woody, M.L., Gibb, B.E., Predicting changes in depressive symptoms from pregnancy to postpartum: The role of brooding rumination and negative inferential styles (2013) Cognitive Therapy and Research, 37 (1), pp. 71-77; Beck, C.T., Predictors of postpartum depression: An update (2001) Nursing research, 50 (5), pp. 275-285; Benoit, D., Infant-parent attachment: Definition, types, antecedents, measurement and outcome (2004) Paediatrics & Child Health, 9 (8), p. 541; Bentler, P.M., EQS structural equations program manual (1995) Multivariate Software; Bergant, A.M., Nguyen, T., Heim, K., Ulmer, H., Dapunt, O., [German language version and validation of the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale] (1998) Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946), 123 (3), pp. 35-40; Bigelow, A.E., MacLean, K., Proctor, J., Myatt, T., Gillis, R., Power, M., Maternal sensitivity throughout infancy: Continuity and relation to attachment security (2010) Infant Behaviour and Development, 33 (1), pp. 50-60; Bigelow, A.E., MacLean, K., Proctor, J., The role of joint attention in the development of infants' play with objects (2004) Developmental Science, 7 (5), pp. 518-526; Bollen, K.A., Stine, R.A., Bootstrapping goodness-of-fit measures in structural equation models (1993) Sage Focus Editions, 154, pp. 111-135; Brewin, C., The social context of explanatory style (1991) Psychological Inquiry, 2, pp. 19-21; Brockington, I.F., Macdonald, E., Wainscott, G., Anxiety, obsessions and morbid preoccupations in pregnancy and the puerperium (2006) Archives of Women's Mental Health, 9 (5), pp. 253-263; Brockington, I.F., Oates, J., George, S., Turner, D., Vostanis, P., Sullivan, M., A screening questionnaire for mother-infant bonding disorders (2001) Archives of Women's Mental Health, 3 (4), pp. 133-140; Butler, L.D., Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Gender differences in responses to depressed mood in a college sample (1994) Sex Roles, 30 (5-6), pp. 331-346; Byrne, B.M., Structural equation modeling with AMOS, EQS, and LISREL: Comparative approaches to testing for the factorial validity of a measuring instrument (2001) International Journal of Testing, 1 (1), pp. 55-86; Cox, J.L., Chapman, G., Murray, D., Jones, P., Validation of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in non-postnatal women (1996) Journal of Affective Disorders, 39 (3), pp. 185-189; Cox, J., Holden, J., (2003) A guide to the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, , Royal College of Psychiatrists, London, Gaskell; Cox, J.L., Holden, J.M., Sagovsky, R., Detection of postnatal depression.

This might be realised behaviourally, pharmacologically or via more radical routes such as brain stimulation. Successful approaches in each of these domains include trial-spacing, rest, and NMDA or cholinergic receptor modulation, but the goal of enhancement has to be clear as some approaches can enhance in one domain but inhibit in another. Enhancement may also extend the duration of memory rather than augment encoding, an idea conceptually embedded into the synaptic-tagging-and-capture theory of memory persistence. In addition, recent work on human spatial memory reflects new findings about the interacting components of egocentric and allocentric processing of human navigation. © 2015.",,"O'Keefe, J., Nadel, L., (1978) The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map, , Clarendon Press, Oxford; Scoville, W.B., Milner, B., Loss of recent memory after bilateral hippocampal lesions (1957) J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry, 20, pp. 11-21; Beddington, J., Cooper, C.L., Field, J., Goswami, U., Huppert, F.A., Jenkins, R., Jones, H.S., Thomas, S.M., The mental wealth of nations (2008) Nature, 455, pp. 1057-1060; McGaugh, J.L., Roozendaal, B., Drug enhancement of memory consolidation: historical perspective and neurobiological implications (2009) Psychopharmacology (Berlin), 202, pp. 3-14; Lee, Y.-S., Silva, A.J., The molecular and cell-biology of enhanced cognition (2009) Nat Rev Neurosci, 10, pp. 126-140; Lynch, G., Cox, C.D., Gall, C.M., Pharmacological enhancement of memory or cognition in normal subjects (2014) Front Syst Neurosci, 8, pp. 1-18. , (Article 90); O'Keefe, J., Place units in the hippocampus of the freely moving rat (1976) Exp Neurol, 51, pp. 78-109; Taube, J.S., Muller, R.U., Ranck, J.B., Head-direction cells recorded from the postsubiculum in freely moving rats.

Here we show that human genetic research has contributed to such understanding. While candidate gene studies have partially confirmed animal-based hypotheses, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided evidence for novel memory-related genes. In this article we review candidate gene and GWAS findings related to working memory, episodic memory and emotional memory in healthy cohorts. These memory types are disturbed in neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Studies on the genetic underpinnings of memory functions in healthy cohorts are important for a better understanding of physiological processes and for the identification of novel drug targets related to such conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Baddeley, A., Working memory (1992) Science, 255, pp. 556-559; Shah, P., Miyake, A., Models of working memory: mechanisms of active maintenance and executive control (1999) Models of Working Memory: An Introduction, pp. 1-27. , Cambridge University Press, A.

The TRiPM was administered to 286 Italian individuals along with the Psychopathy Personality Inventory-Revised as well as measures of negative affect (anxiety, depression, stress, and hopelessness) and normal-range personality traits. The Italian TriPM showed excellent reliability and was minimally influenced by age and education. Some interesting differences emerged between males and females even though the overall pattern of correlations for TriPM scales with many criterion measures was fairly consistent across gender. TriPM Boldness was associated with indices of adaptive function as well as maladjustment. TriPM Disinhibition was most strongly associated with indices of the behavioral deviance, as well as internalizing problems. Scores on TriPM Meanness were most strongly associated with scales indexing coldheartedness, Machiavellianism, and antagonism. These findings broaden the nomological network of the Triarchic model of psychopathy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Psychopathy; Triarchic psychopathy measure; Validation study","Aish, A.M., Wasserman, D., Does Beck's hopelessness scale really measure several components?

Diseases such as microbiome dysregulation or depression can be seen as complex systems as well and were shown to exhibit patterns of nonlinearity in their response to perturbations. These nonlinearities can be revealed by a sudden shift in system states, for instance from health to disease. The identification and characterization of early warning signals which could predict upcoming critical transitions is of primordial interest as prevention of disease onset is a major aim in health care.

These deposits are termed Camaná Formation. We have applied for the first time, advanced multi-method analytical techniques to sediments of the Camaná Formation in order to define precise sedimentation ages, unravel sediment provenance, and to explain its tectono-sedimentary evolution.Zircon U-Pb geochronology and multiple geological evidences suggest that the Camaná Formation ranges in age from Late Oligocene to Late Miocene, and may even extend into the Pliocene. We propose a provenance model for the Camaná Formation based on U-Pb geochronology, heavy mineral analysis, and single-grain mineral chemistry by LA-ICP-MS. This model suggests that sediments of the lower part of the Camaná Formation derive from rocks forming the Coastal Cordillera (i.e. the Arequipa Massif and the San Nicolas Batholith) and the widespread ignimbrites of the ~24-10. Ma Huaylillas volcanic arc. In contrast, sediments of the upper part of the Camaná Formation derive predominantly from rocks forming the Western Cordillera (i.e. the Arequipa Massif, the Tacaza Group, and the Coastal Batholith) and products of the ~10-3. Ma Lower Barroso volcanic arc). Accordingly, we infer that uplift of the Coastal Cordillera has strongly influenced deposition of the Camaná Formation since Late Oligocene. A marked shift in provenance within the Camaná Formation at around Middle to Late Miocene time (14-12. Ma) suggests drastic uplift of the Western Cordillera at that time. This uplift has triggered increased relief and erosion in the Western Cordillera, and subsequent deposition of fluvial conglomerates in the Camaná Basin. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Camaná Formation; Central Andes; Coastal Cordillera; Heavy minerals; Provenance analysis; U-Pb geochronology","Acosta, H., Alván, A., Rodríguez, J., Actividad tectónica del Sistema de Fallas Cincha-LLuta-Incapuquio durante la evolución de la cuenca Arequipa en el Jurásico (2010) XV Congreso Peruano de Geología, Cusco.

The significant runoff increase in the Sahelian reach of Niger river makes us interested in the behavior of the basins of the tributary koris of Niger River in the Niamey area, in Niger. These koris generally formed during a single storm event, within depressions previously occupied by ponds; these ponds are overflown creating a new ""kori"". This study examines in detail the causes of this new exorheism mechanism. The main explanation of this evolution has been determined as being the strong runoff increase, related to an extension of crusted soils due to agricultural practices, mostly the reduction of fallow duration. The degradation of their structural stability leads to crusting and a strong reduction of their hydraulic conductivity. This is linked to water and sediment balance at the catchment scale. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Endorheism; Exorheism; Horton-type runoff; Runoff coefficient; Sahel","Albergel, J., Sécheresse, désertification et ressources en eau de surface - Application aux petits bassins du Burkina Faso (1987) IAHS Publ., 168. , http:http://iahs.info/redbooks/a168/iahs_168_0355.pdf, The Influence of Climate Change and Climatic Variability on the Hydrologic Regime and Water Resources (Proceedings of the Vancouver Symposium, August 1987); Amogu, O., (2009) La dégradation des espaces sahéliens et ses conséquences sur l'alluvionnement du fleuve Niger Moyen, , (PhD thesis), Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble, (420 pp., title in French but the document is written in English); Amogu, O., Descroix, L., Yéro, K.S., Le Breton, E., Mamadou, I., Ali, A., Vischel, T., Belleudy, P., Increasing river flows in the Sahel?

In this study, we wished to examine predictors of short- and long-term avoidance after inpatient group interventions for agoraphobia. Methods Ninety-six (68%) of 141 agoraphobic patients (74% women) who had completed treatment in two open and one randomized controlled trial (RCT) were followed up 13 to 21 years after start of treatment. Results Major depression at pre-treatment predicted less short-term (up to one year after end of treatment) improvement in agoraphobic avoidance. Working and being married/cohabiting at pre-treatment predicted greater long-term (across one-year, two-year, and 13-21 years follow-up) improvement. In contrast, the duration of agoraphobia, amount of Axis I and II co-morbidity, being diagnosed with avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, and the use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines the month before intake to treatment, were unrelated to short-term as well as long-term outcome. Limitations As many as 31.9% of the included patients did not attend long-term follow-up and the power of the study was limited. The long time period between the two and 13-21 year follow-ups is a limitation, in which it is difficult to assess what actually happened. Although all the patients received some form of CBT, there was variability among the treatments. Conclusions The only short-term predictor identified represented a clinical feature, whereas the long-term predictors represented features of the patients' life situation. The limited power of the study precludes the inference that non-significant predictors are unrelated to follow-up outcome. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The crewmembers are confined in an isolated environment, have limited communication with the outside world, and often undergo unpredictable risks, which may lead to the aggravation and acceleration of depression, displacement, and even interpersonal conflicts. These psychological factors could deteriorate the astronauts' effectiveness and safety. Therefore, the aim of the study is to identify the possible patterns over time regarding changes in the emotional states, cohesion and other group dynamics during a 105-day isolation period. The experiment was conducted in an analogue space station at Beihang University, referred to as Lunar Palace 1, which is the first crew made up of all Chinese members. In the experiment, all the crewmembers completed a profile of mood states (POMS) questionnaire every week, along with the group's environment scale (GES) and work environment scale (WES) every two weeks. Following the experiment's isolation period, semi-structured interviews were also conducted as qualitative data. As a result, the following observations were determined: 1) there was no 3rd quarter phenomenon observed during 80 days isolated experiment for Group 3; and the average positive emotions and cohesion of crew were gradually increased with the process. 2) Significant individual differences were identified; and crewmembers possessed different change patterns on psychological state. 3) Crew structure with 1 male and 2 female, less pre-mission team building, and collectivist culture might influence the psychosocial interaction of crew. In summary, the results from Lunar Palace 1 demonstrated that the emotions and climate of Group 3 was in a good state for a successful mission. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of IAA.

These sex differences likely represent underlying differences in connectivity and/or the balance of neuronal excitability within the mPFC. Recently, we demonstrated that signaling via the metabotropic γ-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA<inf>B</inf>R) and G protein-gated inwardly-rectifying K+ (GIRK/Kir3) channels modulates the excitability of the key output neurons of the mPFC, the layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons. Here, we report a sex difference in the GABA<inf>B</inf>R-GIRK signaling pathway in these neurons. Specifically, GABA<inf>B</inf>R-dependent GIRK currents recorded in the prelimbic region of the mPFC were larger in adolescent male mice than in female counterparts. Interestingly, this sex difference was not observed in layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons of the adjacent infralimbic cortex, nor was it seen in young adult mice. The sex difference in GABA<inf>B</inf>R-GIRK signaling is not attributable to different expression levels of signaling pathway components, but rather to a phosphorylation-dependent trafficking mechanism. Thus, sex differences related to some diseases associated with altered mPFC function may be explained in part by sex differences in GIRK-dependent signaling in mPFC pyramidal neurons. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Histidine is an amino acid that is present in dried bonito broth, and we sought to evaluate whether histidine would affect feelings of fatigue in humans. We investigated the effects of histidine intake on the feeling of fatigue, mood states and mental task performance by performing a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial. Twenty subjects with high fatigue and sleep disruption scores were asked to ingest histidine or a placebo every day for two weeks. The subjects' mood states were evaluated using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) scale and a visual analog scale (VAS) for eight feelings (fatigue, depression, carelessness, drowsiness, clear thinking, motivation, attentiveness and concentration). We also measured subjects' cognitive performance using the CogHealth test battery. The fatigue T-scores on the POMS test decreased significantly following histidine ingestion compared to placebo ingestion (p < 0.05). After two weeks of histidine ingestion, the reaction time for the working memory task in the CogHealth test battery was significantly shorten compared to placebo ingestion. The VAS scores for clear thinking and for attentiveness were increased significantly following histidine ingestion compared to placebo ingestion (p < 0.05). These results suggest that daily ingestion of histidine may ameliorate feelings of fatigue, increase performance during working memory tasks, and improve the clear thinking and attentiveness. © 2015.","Cognitive performance; CogState; Histidine; Mental fatigue; POMS","Lesley, M., Arnold, M.D., Understanding fatigue in major depressive disorder and other medical disorder (2008) Psychosomatics, 49, pp. 185-190; (2013) Anti-fatigue Clinical Evaluation Guidelines, , (Tokyo); Boksem, M.A., Tops, M., The mental fatigue: costs and benefits (2008) Brain Res.

Therefore, a global sensitivity analysis of the influence of main or uneasily-measured 26 input parameters on five model outputs, i.e. cumulative gas production, gas production rate, hydrate saturation, gas saturation and aqueous saturation, under depressurization and brine-inhibitor injection was performed using the LH-OAT sampling method. The 26 parameters were classified as 'Very important', 'Important', 'Slightly important', and 'Unimportant' by analyzing their sensitivity indices at different sampling times and sampling positions in the modeling area, using the TSPAC segmentation package. The sensitivity of an input parameter to a model output was dependent on sampling time, sampling position and the identity of the model output in question. Cumulative gas production and gas production rate were governed by four permeability-related parameters (parameter n and residual aqueous saturation (in the relative permeability-saturation model), permeability reduction exponent and critical mobile phase saturation) and four inhibitor-related parameters (inhibitor density, the specific enthalpy of the dissolution of the inhibitor in water, reference inhibitor mole fraction in the aqueous phase and inhibitor-induced reference temperature depression). Hydrate saturation was governed by two hydrate dissociation-related parameters (temperature-dependent hydrate specific heat and hydrate density) and two parameters related to the flow of released fluids in the pore network (permeability and pore structure expansion). Gas saturation was governed by several types of input parameters: six parameters related to the flow of pore gas (parameter n and residual aqueous saturation (in the relative permeability-saturation model), critical mobile phase saturation, intrinsic permeability, permeability reduction exponent and pore compressibility), three inhibitor-related parameters (the specific enthalpy of the dissolution of the inhibitor in water, reference inhibitor mole fraction in the aqueous phase and inhibitor-induced reference temperature depression) and two hydrate dissociation-related parameters (temperature-dependent hydrate density polynomial and temperature-dependent hydrate specific heat polynomial). Finally, aqueous saturation was governed by five permeability-related parameters (parameter λ and residual aqueous saturation (in the saturation-capillary pressure function model), pore expansion, grain specific heat and the tortuosity factor model). Overall, the most influential parameter for all five model outputs was the parameter n in the relative permeability-saturation function model. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Gas hydrate; Parameter ranking; Parameter sensitivity analysis; Segmentation; TOUGH+Hydrate (T+H) model","Ascough, J.C., Green, T.R., Ma, L., Ahuja, L.R., Key criteria and selection of sensitivity analysis methods applied to natural resource models (2005) International Congress on Modeling and Simulation Proceedings Society of Australia and New Zealand, pp. 170-176; Bai, Y.H., Yang, H., Du, Y., Zhao, Y., The sensitivity analysis of scaling criteria in gas hydrate reservoir physical simulation (2013) Energ.

The samples were collected from 118 stations located in patches of four vegetation types. Relationships between the contents of particular elements and four groups of factors (geomorphology, hydroperiod, water quality and vegetation) were tested using Redundancy Analysis (RDA). The most important factors influencing the heavy metal contents were the maximum depth and area of the pond, its hydroperiod, water pH and conductivity values. In general, low quantities of heavy metals were recorded in the sediments of kettle-like ponds (small but located in deep depressions) and high in water bodies of the shore-bursting type (large but shallow). Moreover, quantities of particular elements were influenced by the structure of the vegetation covering the pond. Based on the results, we show which types of astatic ponds are most exposed to contamination and suggest some conservation practices that may reduce the influx of heavy metals. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Heavy metal contamination; Impact of agriculture; Kettle hole; Pothole; Temporary waters; Vernal pool","(1992) Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater, , APHA, Washington; Barałkiewicz, D., Chudzińska, M., Szpakowska, B., Świerk, D., Gołdyn, R., Dondajewska, R., Storm water contamination and its effect on the quality of urban surface waters (2014) Environ.

However, little is known about the relationship between cue-induced craving and cognitive control toward cocaine cues. While studies suggest that cocaine users have an attentional bias toward cocaine cues, the present study extends this research by testing if cocaine use disorder patients (CDPs) can control their eye movements toward cocaine cues and whether their response varied by cue-induced craving intensity. Methods: Thirty CDPs underwent a cue exposure procedure to dichotomize them into high and low craving groups followed by a modified antisaccade task in which subjects were asked to control their eye movements toward either a cocaine or neutral drug cue by looking away from the suddenly presented cue. The relationship between breakdowns in cognitive control (as measured by eye errors) and cue-induced craving (changes in self-reported craving following cocaine cue exposure) was investigated. Results: CDPs overall made significantly more errors toward cocaine cues compared to neutral cues, with higher cravers making significantly more errors than lower cravers even though they did not differ significantly in addiction severity, impulsivity, anxiety, or depression levels. Cue-induced craving was the only specific and significant predictor of subsequent errors toward cocaine cues. Conclusion: Cue-induced craving directly and specifically relates to breakdowns of cognitive control toward cocaine cues in CDPs, with higher cravers being more susceptible. Hence, it may be useful identifying high cravers and target treatment toward curbing craving to decrease the likelihood of a subsequent breakdown in control. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Addiction; Antisaccades;

Accumulating literature indicates that low levels of attachment may sensitize individuals to increased multiple risk behaviors when depression symptoms exist. This investigation examined the interactive effects of attachment and depression symptoms on multiple risk behavior. Methods We conducted hierarchical logistic regression analyses to examine the impact of attachment and depression symptoms on multiple risk behavior in our post-war sample of 551 adolescents in Gulu district. Results Analyses revealed interactive effects for only maternal attachment-by-depression interaction. Interestingly, high levels of maternal attachment exacerbated the relationship between depression symptoms and multiple risk behaviors while low levels of maternal attachment attenuated this relationship. Limitations It is possible that this analysis could be biased by a common underlying factor that influences self-reporting and therefore is correlated with each of self-reported attachment security, depressive symptoms, and multiple risk behaviors. Conclusions These findings suggest that maternal attachment serves as a protective factor at low levels while serving as an additional risk factor at high levels. Findings support and expand current knowledge about the roles that attachment and depression symptoms play in the development of multiple risk behaviors and suggest a more complex etiology for post-war adolescents. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction of quality outcomes framework (QOF) performance indicators may have altered GP recording of depression. Methods Time trend analyses of GP recording of depression before and after the recession (from April 2008), and the QOF (from April 2006) were conducted on anonymised consultation data from 142 English practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, April 2003-March 2013. Results 293,596 patients had computer codes for depressive diagnoses or symptoms in the 10 years. Prevalence of depression codes fell from 44.6 (95% CI 44.2, 45.0) per 1000 person years at risk (PYAR) in 2003/2004 to 38.0 (37.7, 38.3) in 2008/2009, rising to 39.5 (39.2, 39.9) in 2012/2013. Incidence of first-ever depression codes fell from 11.9 (95% CI 11.7, 12.1) per 1000 PYAR in 2003/2004 to 9.5 (9.3, 9.7) in 2008/2009, rising to 10.0 (9.8, 10.2) in 2012/1203. Prevalence increased in men but not women following the recession, associated with increased unemployment. Following introduction of the QOF, GPs used more non-QOF-qualifying symptom or other codes than QOF-qualifying diagnostic codes for new episodes. Limitations Clinical data recording is probably incomplete. Participating practices were relatively large and not representative across English regions. Conclusions Rates of recorded depression in English general practices were falling prior to the economic recession but increased again subsequently, among men, associated with increased unemployment. GPs responded to the QOF by switching from diagnostic to symptom codes, removing most depressed patients from the denominator for measuring GP performance in assessing depression. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to evaluate the influence of presenteeism on depression and absence due to mental disease. Methods A prospective study of 1831 Japanese employees from all areas of Japan was conducted. Presenteeism and depression were measured by the validated Japanese version of the World Health Organization Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (WHO-HPQ) and the K6 scale, respectively. Absence due to mental disease across a 2-year follow up was surveyed through medical certificates obtained for work absence. Results After adjusting for age and gender, participants with higher rates of sickness absolute and relative presenteeism (the lowest tertile of the scores) were significantly more likely to be absent due to mental disease (OR=4.40, 95% CI: 1.65-11.73, and OR=3.31, 95% CI: 1.50-7.27). Subsequently, higher rates of sickness absolute or relative presenteeism were significantly associated with higher rates of depression (K6=13) one year later (OR=3.79, 95% CI: 2.48-5.81, and OR=2.89, 95% CI: 1.98-4.22). Limitations The number of females in the sample was relatively small. However, the rates of absence for females with and without mental illness did not significantly differ from those of men. Conclusions More sickness presenteeism scores were found to be related to higher rates of depression and absence due to mental disease in this large-scale cohort of Japanese workers. Measurement of presenteeism could be used to evaluate the risk for depression and absenteeism. Furthermore, our findings suggest that intervention to improve presenteeism would be effective in preventing depression and absence due to mental illness. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Depression; Presenteeism; Sickness absence; WHOHPQ; Workers","Aronsson, G., Gustafsson, K., Sickness presenteeism: Prevalence, attendance-pressure factors, and an outline of a model for research (2005) J.

Structural alterations of VMPFC have consistently been observed in adult major depression and are associated with depression severity, yet it is unknown whether young children with depression demonstrate similar abnormalities. We investigated cortical thickness differences in the VMPFC of children with a history of preschool-onset depression (PO-MDD). Methods Participants in a longitudinal study of PO-MDD underwent structural brain imaging between the ages of 7 and 12 years. Using local cortical distance metrics, cortical thickness of the VMPFC was compared in children with and without a history of PO-MDD. Results Children previously diagnosed with PO-MDD (n=34) had significantly thinner right VMPFC vs. children without a history of PO-MDD [(n=95); F(1,126)=5.97, (p=.016)]. This effect was specific to children with a history of PO-MDD vs. other psychiatric conditions and was independent of comorbid anxiety or externalizing disorders. Decreases in right VMPFC thickness were predicted by preschool depressive symptoms independent of depressive symptoms in school age. Limitations Results are cross-sectional and cannot distinguish whether thinner right VMPFC represents a vulnerability marker of MDD, consequence of MDD, or marker of remitted MDD. Longitudinal imaging is needed to contextualize how this difference relates to normative VMPFC structural development. Conclusions Onset of depression at preschool age was associated with decreased cortical thickness of right VMPFC. This finding implicates the VMPFC in depression from very early stages of brain development. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence rates of both vascular and non-vascular late life depression (LLD) at baseline, to examine the natural course of LLD, and to investigate the influence of White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on depression after three years. Method The baseline study employed a two-stage design, Phase I population survey (n=783) and Phase II diagnostic evaluation (n=122). In the 3-year follow-up study, baseline participants completing the second phase were reassessed with the same methodology. WMHs severity was rated visually by the modified Fazekas scale and WMHs volume was calculated using an automated method. Results The prevalence rates of vascular major depressive disorder (MDD) and vascular non-major depressive disorder (nMDD) were 2.39% (56.2% of MDD) and 4.24% (34.0% of nMDD). Subjects with a score of 2 or more on the modified Fazekas scale in either deep white matter hyperintensities or subcortical gray matter ratings had an 8.1 times greater risk of developing a depressive disorder in the 3-year follow-up study. Greater Log WMHs volume (odds ratio=5.78, 95% CI, 1.04-31.72) at baseline was an independent predictor for depressive disorder in the 3-year assessment. Limitations Response rate and follow-up rate were relatively low. Conclusions Vascular depression is common and makes up about a half of MDD in elders. Greater WMHs severity is a crucial factor predicting future depression risk, which supports the previous vascular depression hypothesis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Judging that differentiating features are more likely to vary in their signal intensity, we sought to determine the number of features required to effect differentiation and their hierarchical order. Methods The 24-item clinician-rated Sydney Melancholia Prototype Index (SMPI-CR) was completed for 364 unipolar depressed patients. The sample was divided into two cohorts according to the recruitment period. An RPART classification tree analysis identified the most discriminating SMPI items in the development sample of 197 patients, and examined the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic decisions, then sought to replicate findings in a validation sample of 169 patients. Results Independent analyses of putative SMPI items identified only seven items as required to discriminate those with clinically-diagnosed melancholic or non-melancholic depression when the conditions were examined separately. An RPART analysis considering differentiation of melancholic and non-melancholic depression in the total samples retained five of those items in the classification tree, three of which were non-symptom items, and with 92% sensitivity and 80% specificity in the development sample. This reduced item set showed 93% sensitivity and 82% specificity in the validation sample. Limitations Our clinical judgment of melancholic or non-melancholic depression may not correspond with the clinical logic employed by other clinicians. Conclusion Only five SMPI items were required to derive a succinct and efficient decision tree, comprising high sensitivity and specificity in differentiating melancholic and non-melancholic depression. Current study findings provide an empirical model that could enrich cliniciansapproach to differentiating melancholic and non-melancholic depression. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Assessment; Depression; Diagnosis; Melancholia","Bech, P., Rafaelsen, O.J., The use of rating scales exemplified by a comparison of the Hamilton and the Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale (1980) Acta Psychiatr.

J. Clin. Psychiatry, 69, (4), 597-602). Rumination is a cognitive mechanism found to exacerbate and maintain both PTSD and MDD (Elwood et al.; 2009. Clin. Psychol. Rev. 29, (1), 87-100; Olatunji et al.; 2013. Clin. Psychol.: Sci. Pract. 20, (3), 225-257). Aims Assess whether four rumination subtypes moderate the relationship between comorbid PTSD and MDD symptoms. Method We consecutively sampled patients (N=45) presenting to a mental health clinic using self-report measures of PTSD and MDD symptoms, and rumination in a cross-sectional design. Results Repetitive rumination moderates the relationship between PTSD and MDD symptoms at one standard deviation above the mean (β=.044, p=.016), while anticipatory rumination moderates the relationship between PTSD and MDD symptoms at mean levels and higher levels of anticipatory rumination (mean β=.030, p=.042; higher β=.060, p=.008). Discussion Repetitive and anticipatory rumination should be assessed in the context of comorbid PTSD and MDD and interventions should focus on reducing these rumination subtypes. Limitations Results should be replicated with other trauma populations because the number and complexity of traumatic events may impact the assessed symptoms. Constructs should also be assessed longitudinally, in order to establish causality. We are unable to confirm why rumination styles moderated the relationship between PTSD and depression or why counterfactual thinking and problem-focused thinking did not moderate the relationship between the two constructs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Although new parents are frequently affected by depressive symptoms, little is known about prevalence, risk, and predictors of parental postpartum depression (PPD) following VLBW birth. Furthermore, most studies assessing PPD in parents of preterm children relied on self-report only. Methods As part of the HaFEn cohort-study, data from the index groups of parents with VLBW infants and the control group of parents with term infants were cross-sectionally analysed. Families were recruited at the three largest centres of perinatal medical care in Hamburg, Germany. PPD was evaluated one month postpartum using standardized questionnaires and clinical interviews. Socioeconomic status, social support, risks during pregnancy, and psychiatric lifetime diagnoses were also assessed. A multiple random coefficient model was used to examine predictors of PPD in both parents simultaneously. Results 230 mothers and 173 fathers were included. Depending on the measure, the risk of being postnatally depressed was 4 to 18 times higher in mothers and 3 to 9 times higher in fathers from the index group. The most relevant risk factor for PPD was the birth of a VLBW infant, followed by female sex, lifetime psychiatric disorder, and low social support. Limitations Results presented here, are based on cross sectional data. Therefore no temporal relationships can be established. Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of early screening for PPD in both parents of VLBW infants. Factors contributing to developing depression should also be considered in neonatal care. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Maternal/paternal; Postpartum depression; Preterm birth; Risk factors","Affleck, G., Tennen, H., Rowe, J., (1991) Infants in Crisis: How Parents Cope with Newborn Intensive Care and Its Aftermath, , Springer-Verlag New York, NY; Alkozei, A., McMahon, E., Lahav, A., Stress levels and depressive symptoms in NICU mothers in the early postpartum period (2014) J.

However, no human imaging studies have examined how recent life stress exposure modulates the neural systems that underlie reward processing in depressed and healthy individuals. Methods In this proof-of-concept study, 12 MDD and 10 psychiatrically healthy individuals were interviewed using the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS) to assess their perceived levels of recent acute and chronic life stress exposure. Additionally, each participant performed a monetary incentive delay task under baseline (no-stress) and stress (social-evaluative) conditions during functional MRI. Results Across groups, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activation to reward feedback was greater during acute stress versus no-stress conditions in individuals with greater perceived stressor severity. Under acute stress, depressed individuals showed a positive correlation between perceived stressor severity levels and reward-related mPFC activation (r=0.79, p=0.004), whereas no effect was found in healthy controls. Moreover, for depressed (but not healthy) individuals, the correlations between the stress (r=0.79) and no-stress (r=-0.48) conditions were significantly different. Finally, relative to controls, depressed participants showed significantly reduced mPFC gray matter, but functional findings remained robust while accounting for structural differences. Limitation Small sample size, which warrants replication. Conclusion Depressed individuals experiencing greater recent life stress recruited the mPFC more under stress when processing rewards. Our results represent an initial step toward elucidating mechanisms underlying stress sensitization and recurrence in depression. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Anhedonia; fMRI; Life events; Reward processing; Stress Depression","Amat, J., Baratta, M.V., Paul, E., Bland, S.T., Watkins, L.R., Maier, S.F., Medial prefrontal cortex determines how stressor controllability affects behavior and dorsal raphe nucleus (2005) Nat.

However, evidence about faith-sensitive therapies for minority religious groups is limited. Methods Behavioural Activation (BA), an effective psychological therapy for depression emphasising client values, was adapted for Muslim patients using a robust process that retained core effective elements of BA. The adapted intervention built on evidence synthesised from a systematic review of the literature, qualitative interviews with 29 key informants and findings from a feasibility study involving 19 patients and 13 mental health practitioners. Results Core elements of the BA model were acceptable to Muslim patients. Religious teachings could potentially reinforce and enhance BA strategies and concepts were more familiar to patients and more valued than the standard approaches. Patients appreciated therapist professionalism and empathy more than shared religious identity but did expect therapist acceptance that Islamic teachings could be helpful. Patients were generally enthusiastic about the approach, which proved acceptable and feasible to most participants; however, therapists needed more support than anticipated to implement the intervention. Limitations The study did not re-explore effectiveness of the intervention within this specific population. Strategies to address implementation issues highlighted require further research. Conclusions The adapted intervention may be more appropriate for Muslim patients than standard therapies and is feasible in practice. Therapist comfort is an important issue for services wishing to introduce the adapted therapy. The fusion of conceptual frameworks within this approach provides increased choice to Muslim patients, in line with policy and research recommendations. © 2015 The Authors.","Behavioural activation; Culture Psychotherapy; Depression; Muslim; Religion","Anderson, N., Heywood-Everett, S., Siddiqi, N., Wright, J., Meredith, J., McMillan, D., Faith-adapted psychological therapies for depression and anxiety: Systematic review and meta-analysis (2015) J.

However, the changes of topological properties of anatomical brain networks in remitted major depressive disorder patients (rMDD) remain an open question. The present study provides an exploratory examination of pattern changes among current major depressive disorder patients (cMDD), rMDD patients and healthy controls (HC) by means of a pattern recognition analysis. Methods Twenty-eight cMDD patients (age range: 22-54, mean age: 39.57), 15 rMDD patients (age range: 23-53, mean age: 38.40) and 30 HC (23-54, mean age: 35.57) were enrolled. For each subject, we computed five kinds of weighted white matter (WM) networks via employing five physiological parameters (i.e. fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, λ1, λ2 and λ3) and then calculated three network measures of these weighted networks. We treated these measures as features and fed into a feature selection mechanism to choose the most discriminative features for linear support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Results Linear SVM could excellently distinguish the three groups with the 100% classification accuracy of recognizing cMDD/rMDD from HC, and 97.67% classification accuracy of recognizing cMDD from rMDD. The further pattern analysis found two types of discriminative patterns among cMDD, rMDD and HC. (i) Compared with HC, both cMDD and rMDD exhibited the similar deficit patterns of node strength primarily involving the salience network (SN), default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal network (FPN). (ii) Compared with cMDD and rMDD showed the altered pattern of intra-communicability within DMN and inter-communicability between DMN and the other sub-networks including the visual recognition network (VRN) and SN. Limitations The present study had a limited sample size and a lack of larger independent data set to validate the methods and confirm the findings. Conclusions These findings implied that the impairment of MDD was closely associated with the alterations of connections within SN, DMN and FPN, whereas the remission of MDD was benefitted from the network compensatory of intra-communication within DMN and inter-communication between DMN and the other sub-networks (i.e.; VRN and SN). © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to identify and investigate atypical profiles of depressive symptoms using a data-driven approach based on the item response theory (IRT). Methods A large cohort of participants completed the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-report (IDS-SR) at baseline (n=2329) and two-year follow-up (n=1971). Person-fit statistics were used to quantify how strongly each patient's observed symptom profile deviated from the expected profile given the group-based IRT model. Identified atypical profiles were investigated in terms of reported symptoms, external correlates and temporal consistency. Results Compared to others, atypical responders (6.8%) showed different symptom profiles, with higher 'mood reactivity' and 'suicidal ideation' and lower levels of mild symptoms like 'sad mood'. Atypical responding was associated with more medication use (especially tricyclic antidepressants: OR=1.5), less somatization (OR=0.8), anxiety severity (OR=0.8) and anxiety diagnoses (OR=0.8-0.9), and was shown relatively stable (29.0%) over time. Limitations This is a methodological proof-of-principal based on the IDS-SR in outpatients. Implementation studies are needed. Conclusion Person-fit statistics can be used to identify patients who report atypical patterns of depressive symptoms. In research and clinical practice, the extra diagnostic information provided by person-fit statistics could help determine if respondents' depression severity scores are interpretable or should be augmented with additional information. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Oxidative stress may be implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and can be measured via the neurometabolite glutathione using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). This study aimed to examine the relationship between glutathione concentration and depressive symptom severity in older adults 'at-risk' of depression. In total, fifty-eight older adults considered 'at-risk' of depression (DEP) and 12 controls underwent 1H-MRS, medical and neuropsychological assessments. Glutathione was measured in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and calculated as a ratio to creatine. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Compared to controls, DEP patients had increased glutathione/creatine ratios in the ACC (t=2.7, p=0.012). In turn, these increased ratios were associated with greater depressive symptoms (r=0.28, p=0.038), and poorer performance on a verbal learning task (r=-0.28, p=0.040). In conclusion, depressive symptoms in older people are associated with increased glutathione in the ACC. Oxidative stress may be pathophysiologically linked to illness development and may represent an early compensatory response. Further research examining the utility of glutathione as a marker for depressive symptoms and cognitive decline is now required. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

There are several methods to define and calculate dose equivalence but for antidepressants, only daily defined dose and consensus methods have been applied to date. The purpose of the present study is to examine dose equivalence of antidepressants by a less arbitrary and more systematic method. Methods We used data from all randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose trials comparing fluoxetine or paroxetine as standard drugs with any other active antidepressants as monotherapy in the acute phase treatment of unipolar depression. We calculated the ratio of the mean doses for each study and weighted it by the total sample size to find the weighted mean ratio for each drug, which was then used to define the drug's dosage equivalent to fluoxetine 40 mg/d. Results We included 83 studies (14 131 participants). In the primary analysis, fluoxetine 40 mg/day was equivalent to paroxetine dosage of 34.0 mg/day, agomelatine 53.2 mg/day, amitriptyline, 122.3 mg/day, bupropion 348.5 mg/day, clomipramine 116.1 mg/day, desipramine 196.3 mg/day, dothiepin 154.8 mg/day, doxepin 140.1 mg/day, escitalopram 18.0 mg/day, fluvoxamine 143.3 mg/day, imipramine 137.2 mg/day, lofepramine 250.2 mg/day, maprotiline 118.0 mg/day, mianserin, 101.1 mg/day, mirtazapine 50.9 mg/day, moclobemide 575.2 mg/day, nefazodone 535.2 mg/day, nortriptyline 100.9 mg/day, reboxetine 11.5 mg/day, sertraline 98.5 mg/day, trazodone 401.4 mg/day, and venlafaxine 149.4 mg/day. Sensitivity analyses corroborated the results except for doxepin. Limitations The number of studies for some drugs was small. The current method assumes dose response relationship of antidepressants. Conclusions Our findings can be useful for clinicians when they switch antidepressants and for researchers when they compare various antidepressants in their research. © 2015 The Authors.","Antidepressive agents; Dose equivalence; Fluoxetine; Major depression","Ali, I.M., Long-term treatment with antidepressants in primary care are sub-therapeutic doses still being used?

In this one-year prospective cohort study, we explored the impact of chronic BZD/Z use on cognitive decline compared to nonusers. Methods In cognitively capable BZD/Z users and nonusers in 10 Belgian nursing homes, we investigated cognition with the MiniMentalStateExamination(MMSE) at baseline and one year. A decrease of ≥4 points on the MMSE (clinically relevant decrease) was used in multiple logistic regression. We collected baseline demographics, functional, psychometric and social characteristics potentially influencing cognition. Results In both the 131 BZD/Z users and 95 nonusers, the cognition decreased significantly over time, but without significant difference between the groups. Clinically relevant decrease was present in 34% BZD/Z users and 27% nonusers (NS). Controlled for age, gender, education and BZD/Z use, the significant risk factors for clinically relevant cognitive decline were depression, hearing and functional impairment. Frequent reading was associated with less MMSE decrease. Our findings could not demonstrate with statistical significance that BZD/Z use was associated with fast cognitive decline. The risk factors for fast decline were depression, hearing and functional impairment, and the absence of a reading attitude. In addition, BZD/Z use and depression were associated, indicating a complex relationship. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The aim of this study was to develop a prediction model for recurrence of depressive episodes in women using improved methodology. Methods We used prospective data from a general population sample of female twins with a last-year MD episode (n=194). A rich set of baseline predictors was analyzed with Cox proportional hazards regression subject to elastic net regularization to find a model predicting recurrence of depressive episodes. Prediction accuracy of the model was assessed in an independent test sample (n=133), which was limited by the unavailability of a number of key predictors. Results A wide variety of risk factors predicted recurrence of depressive episodes in women: depressive and anxiety symptoms during the index episode, the level of symptoms at the moment of interview, psychiatric and family history, early and recent adverse life events, being unmarried, and problems with friends and finances. Kaplan Meier estimated survival curves showed that the model differentiated between patients at higher and lower risk for recurrence; estimated areas under the curve were in the range of 0.61-0.79. Limitations Despite our rich set of predictors, certain potentially relevant variables were not available, such as biological measures, chronic somatic diseases, and treatment status. Conclusions Recurrence of episodes of MD in women is highly multifactorial. Future studies should take this into account for the development of clinically useful prediction algorithms. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Major depressive disorder; Prediction; Recurrence; Women","(1987) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-III-R, , Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge Cambridge; Antman, E.M., Cohen, M., Bernink, P.J., McCabe, C.H., Horacek, T., Papuchis, G., Mautner, B., Braunwald, E., The TIMI risk score for unstable angina/non-ST elevation MI: A method for prognostication and therapeutic decision making (2000) JAMA, 284, pp. 835-842; Boschloo, L., Schoevers, R.A., Beekman, A.T., Smit, J.H., Van Hemert, A.M., Penninx, B.W., The four-year course of major depressive disorder: The role of staging and risk factor determination (2014) Psychother.

Abnormal serum thyroid hormone levels were also found in MDD patients, which may correlated with the abnormal biochemical metabolism of brain. However, they rarely excluded the compounding effects of medication, and brain degeneration. This study sought to investigate the relationship between the biochemical metabolism and the serum thyroid hormone levels in first-episode, treatment-naive, non-late-life patients with MDD. Methods 26 first-episode, treatment-naive, non-late-life patients with MDD and 13 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Participants underwent two-dimensinal multivoxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) [repetition time (TR)=1000 ms; echo-time (TE)=144 ms] at 1.5 T to obtain bilateral metabolite levels from the white matter in prefrontal (WMP) lobe, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and hippocampus. The ratios of N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) and choline containg compounds (Cho)/creatine (Cr) were calculated. Morning serum free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxin (FT4), total triiodothyronine (T3), total thyroxin (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured before antidepressant treatment. Results On the comparison of brain biochemical changes, MDD patients had a significantly lower NAA/Cr ratio in the left WMP, and lower NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios in the right WMP when compared to the controls. There were no significant differences in the metabolite ratios in the bilateral ACC, and hippocampus. On the comparison of serum thyroid hormone levels, MDD patients had a significantly decreased T3 and TSH levels. On the comparison of correlation of brain biochemical changes and serum thyroid hormone levels in patients with MDD, the NAA/Cr ratio in the right WMP was positively correlated with the level of TSH. Conclusion These findings suggest that biochemical abnormalities and thyroid dysfunction may emerge early in the course of MDD. Dysfunction of neuronal function in the WMP may correlate with the abnormal TSH in patients with MDD, which may be related to the neuropathology of depression. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Major depressive disorder; Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Serum thyroid hormone","Bae, J.N., Macfall, J.R., Krishnan, K.R., Payne, M.E., Steffens, D.C., Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex white matter alterations in late-life depression (2006) Bio.

Adversity has been associated with higher methylation levels in the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) and the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) in adolescents. We investigated cross-sectional and prospective associations of NR3C1 and SLC6A4 methylation with adolescents clinical diagnoses of internalizing disorders and internalizing symptom scores. Methods In a population sample (mean age=16.2) we measured DNA methylation in three regions of NR3C1 (NR3C1-1, N=454; NR3C1-2, N=904; NR3C1-3, N=412) and one region of SLC6A4 (N=939) at baseline. Internalizing problems were operationalized as clinical DSM-IV diagnoses, assessed at 3 year follow-up with a diagnostic interview, and internalizing symptom scores, assessed with Self-Report questionnaires at baseline and follow-up. Results Only NR3C1-1 methylation was positively associated with risk of lifetime internalizing disorders, and with symptom scores at follow-up. However, after accounting for baseline symptom scores there was only a tendency for association with internalizing symptom scores at follow-up. There was no association between SLC6A4 methylation and risk of lifetime internalizing disorders. SLC6A4 methylation and internalizing symptom scores showed a tendency for association, also after accounting for baseline symptom scores. Limitations There was no repeated measure of DNA methylation to study causality between methylation and internalizing problems. Gene expression data were not available. Conclusions Although the role of gene methylation in the development of internalizing problems remains unclear, our findings suggest that gene methylation, particularly of NR3C1, may be involved in the development of internalizing problems in adolescence. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Method Korean young adults (n=128) and American young adults (n=630, of whom 23 has recent treatment for bipolar disorder, and 21for depression) completed self-report questionnaires, including the TEMPS-A, the BIS/BAS scales, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Hypomanic Checklist (HCL-32). Linear regression quantified relations between mood symptoms, sample characteristics, temperament, and BIS/BAS. Results Temperament styles explained 49% of the variance in BDI scores. BIS explained an additional 1% of the variance in BDI scores. BAS Fun and Reward (p<.01), in addition to cyclothymic and hyperthymic temperaments (p<.001) explained 21% of the variance in HCL-32 scores. Sample characteristics were not significant predictors in the full model. Limitations Differences in sample size, the cross-sectional study design, and lack of collateral report or behavioral measures of constructs are limitations. Conclusions Affective temperament and BIS/BAS are complementary but distinct constructs. Affective temperament, particularly cyclothymic, may represent a stronger diathesis for mood pathology, and seems potent irrespective of culture or diagnosis. Assessing temperament may help overcome some challenges in diagnosing mood disorders. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Behavioral activation; Behavioral inhibition; Bipolar disorder; Diagnosis; Mood disorder; Temperament","Akiskal, H., The temperamental foundations of affective disorders (1996) Interpersonal Factors in the Origin and Course of Affective Disorders, pp. 3-30. , C.

Alberto Mileno Onlus Foundation, San Francesco Institute ChietiVasto, Italy","Objective The purpose of this literature database search-based review was to critically consider and evaluate the findings of literature focusing on efficacy and safety of 5-HT3 antagonists in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), so as to test whether preclinical data match clinical therapeutic trials. Design The PubMed database has been searched for papers on 5-HT3 antagonists and OCD in humans and for animal models of OCD and 5-HT3 receptors. Results Of the clinically tested 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, ondansetron has been used to treat OCD in five therapeutic studies, whereas granisetron only in one recent trial. Both showed some efficacy in open studies and superiority to placebo in double-blind studies, along with fair safety. No animal OCD model directly implicated 5-HT3 receptors. Conclusions Overall, results indicate some utility, but the available literature is too scanty to allow for valid conclusions to be drawn. The mismatch between animal models of obsessive-compulsive disorder and clinical data with 5-HT3 antagonists needs more clinical data to ensure that it is not an artefact.

While investigated in various psychiatric conditions, age of onset and related characteristics in agoraphobia have yet to be examined. In light of the new diagnostic status in the DSM-5 edition of agoraphobia as independent from panic disorder, research on agoraphobia as a stand-alone disorder is needed. Methods Admixture analysis was used to determine the best-fitting model for the observed ages at onset of 507 agoraphobia patients participating in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (age range 18-65). Associations between agoraphobia age of onset and different demographic, clinical and psychosocial determinants were examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results Admixture analyses identified two distributions of age of onset, with 27 as the cutoff age (≤ early onset, > late onset). Early onset agoraphobia was only independently associated with family history of anxiety disorders (p<0.01) Limitations Age of onset was assessed retrospectively, and analyses were based on cross-sectional data. Conclusion The best distinguishing age of onset cutoff of agoraphobia was found to be 27. Early onset agoraphobia might constitute of a familial subtype. As opposed to other psychiatric disorders, early onset in agoraphobia does not indicate for increased clinical severity and/or disability. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Age of onset; Agoraphobia; Risk factor","Aderka, I.M., Nickerson, A., Hofmann, S.G., Admixture analysis of the diagnostic subtypes of social anxiety disorder: Implications forthe DSM-V (2011) J.

Several studies have indicated that 5-HT1A receptor agonists increase hippocampal neurogenesis, which is implicated in the action mechanism of antidepressants. However, these agents have not been applied to humans due to intolerable side effects. We recently showed that chronic administration of tandospirone, a clinically available 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, increased hippocampal neurogenesis dose-dependently. The present study was done to determine if chronic tandospirone treatment has antidepressant potential from the standpoint of hippocampal neurogenesis and behavior. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally administered a vehicle or tandospirone (10 mg/kg) once daily for 28 days. Two weeks after starting the injections, animals were exposed to intermittent social defeat (four times over two weeks). The effects of stress and tandospirone on the rodents' behavior were evaluated by the Novelty-Suppressed Feeding (NSF) test. The quantification of hippocampal neurogenesis was estimated using immunostaining with Ki-67 and doublecortin (DCX). Results Chronic tandospirone treatment reversed the psychosocial stress-induced increase in the latency in the NSF test and decrease in the density of DCX-positive cells in the dentate gyrus of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. However, no difference in the density of Ki-67-positive cells was observed between the vehicle- and tandospirone-administered groups. Limitations To clarify the antidepressant potential of TDS, the other behavioral tests for depression will be required. Conclusions Our findings suggest that tandospirone has antidepressant potential through an inhibiting effect on stress-induced changes in hippocampal neurogenesis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Antidepressant; Feeding test; Hippocampal neurogenesis; Novelty-Suppressed; Serotonin 1A receptor partial agonist; Social defeat; Tandospirone","Albert, P.R., François, B.L., Modifying 5-HT1A receptor gene expression as a new target for antidepressant therapy (2010) Front.

The inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<inf>A</inf>) receptor activation not only reduces cortical SD frequency and propagation, but also relieves migraine headache. This study aims to determine the role of major α subtypes of GABA<inf>A</inf> receptor in mediating SD genesis and propagation using an efficient in vitro chick retinal model. We firstly demonstrated that abundant α2, and to a lesser extent, α5 of GABA<inf>A</inf> receptor expression in the chick retina, enabled the tissue useful for studying GABA<inf>A</inf> receptor pharmacology and SD. Marked suppression of SD by SL651498 and TPA023 was observed at 10μmolL-1 and 50μmolL-1, respectively, suggesting a critical role of GABA<inf>A</inf> receptor α subtypes, in particular α2, in modulating retinal SD elicitation and propagation. The negative data on NS11394 at 3μmolL-1 on SD and the little positive selectivity of TPA023 for α5 did not support that α5 subtype is involved in SD genesis and propagation. Our data provide strong evidence that α2, but not α5 is involved in the early stage of migraine, indicating that α2 subtype is a possible drug target related to migraine with aura. © 2015 IBRO.","Chick retina; Cortical spreading depression; GABA<inf>A</inf> receptor; Migraine; TPA023; α2","Atack, J.R., Wafford, K.A., Tye, S.J., Cook, S.M., Sohal, B., Pike, A., Sur, C., McKernan, R.M., TPA023 [7-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-(2-ethyl-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3-ylmethoxy)-3-(2-fluorophenyl)-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine], an agonist selective for alpha2- and alpha3-containing GABAA receptors, is a nonsedating anxiolytic in rodents and primates (2006) J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 316, pp. 410-422; Ayata, C., Cortical spreading depression triggers migraine attack: pro (2010) Headache, 50, pp. 725-730; Ayata, C., Jin, H., Kudo, C., Dalkara, T., Moskowitz, M.A., Suppression of cortical spreading depression in migraine prophylaxis (2006) Ann Neurol, 59, pp. 652-661; Bhaskar, S., Saeidi, K., Borhani, P., Amiri, H., Recent progress in migraine pathophysiology: role of cortical spreading depression and magnetic resonance imaging (2013) Eur J Neurosci, 38, pp. 3540-3551; Braga, M.F., Aroniadou-Anderjaska, V., Li, H., Rogawski, M.A., Topiramate reduces excitability in the basolateral amygdala by selectively inhibiting GluK1 (GluR5) kainate receptors on interneurons and positively modulating GABAA receptors on principal neurons (2009) J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 330, pp. 558-566; Carling, R.W., Madin, A., Guiblin, A., Russell, M.G., Moore, K.W., Mitchinson, A., Sohal, B., Street, L.J., 7-(1,1-Dimethylethyl)-6-(2-ethyl-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3-ylmethoxy)-3-(2-fluorophenyl)-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine: a functionally selective gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) alpha2/alpha3-subtype selective agonist that exhibits potent anxiolytic activity but is not sedating in animal models (2005) J Med Chem, 48, pp. 7089-7092; Cheng, Z.Y., Chebib, M., Schmid, K.L., Identification of GABA receptors in chick cornea (2012) Mol Vis, 18, pp. 1107-1114; Cheng, Z.Y., Wang, X.P., Schmid, K.L., Liu, L., Identification of GABA receptors in chick retinal pigment epithelium (2013) Neurosci Lett, 539, pp. 43-47; de Haas, S.L., Franson, K.L., Schmitt, J.A., Cohen, A.F., Fau, J.B., Dubruc, C., van Gerven, J.M., The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of SL65.1498, a GABA-A alpha2,3 selective agonist, in comparison with lorazepam in healthy volunteers (2009) J Psychopharmacol (Oxford, England), 23, pp. 625-632; Farkas, E., Pratt, R., Sengpiel, F., Obrenovitch, T.P., Direct, live imaging of cortical spreading depression and anoxic depolarisation using a fluorescent, voltage-sensitive dye (2008) J Cereb Blood Flow Metab, 28, pp. 251-262; Green, A.L., Gu, P., De Felice, M., Dodick, D., Ossipov, M.H., Porreca, F., Increased susceptibility to cortical spreading depression in an animal model of medication-overuse headache (2013) Cephalalgia, 34, pp. 594-604; Griebel, G., Perrault, G., Simiand, J., Cohen, C., Granger, P., Depoortere, H., Francon, D., Scatton, B., SL651498, a GABAA receptor agonist with subtype-selective efficacy, as a potential treatment for generalized anxiety disorder and muscle spasms (2003) CNS Drug Rev, 9, pp. 3-20; Hadjikhani, N., Sanchez Del Rio, M., Wu, O., Schwartz, D., Bakker, D., Fischl, B., Kwong, K.K., Moskowitz, M.A., Mechanisms of migraine aura revealed by functional MRI in human visual cortex (2001) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 98, pp. 4687-4692; Hevers, W., Luddens, H., The diversity of GABAA receptors.

However, the underlying pathophysiology of MDD remains poorly understood due to its heterogenic nature. Extensive pre-clinical research suggests that many molecular alterations associated with MDD preferentially localize to the postsynaptic density (PSD). Here, we used a rodent chronic mild stress (CMS) model to generate susceptible and unsusceptible subpopulations. Proteomic analysis using an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and tandem mass spectrometry was performed to identify differentially expressed proteins in enriched PSD preparations from the hippocampi of different groups. More than 1500 proteins were identified and quantified, and 74 membrane proteins were differentially expressed. Of these membrane proteins, 51 (69%) were identified by SynaptomeDB search as having a predicted PSD localization. The unbiased profiles identified several PSD candidate proteins that may be related to CMS vulnerability or insusceptibility, and these two CMS phenotypes displayed differences in the abundance of several types of proteins. A detailed protein functional analysis pointed to a role for PSD-associated proteins involved in signaling and regulatory functions. Within the PSD, the N-methyl-. d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NR2A and its downstream targets contribute to CMS susceptibility. Further analysis of disease relevance indicated that the PSD contains a complex set of proteins of known relevance to mental illnesses including depression. In sum, these findings provide novel insights into the contribution of PSD-associated proteins to stress susceptibility and further advance our understanding of the role of hippocampal synaptic plasticity in MDD. © 2015 IBRO.","Chronic mild stress; Hippocampus; ITRAQ; Major depressive disorder; Postsynaptic density; Proteomics","Abul-Husn, N.S., Bushlin, I., Moron, J.A., Jenkins, S.L., Dolios, G., Wang, R., Iyengar, R., Devi, L.A., Systems approach to explore components and interactions in the presynapse (2009) Proteomics, 9, pp. 3303-3315; Apperson, M.L., Moon, I.S., Kennedy, M.B., Characterization of densin-180, a new brain-specific synaptic protein of the O-sialoglycoprotein family (1996) J Neurosci, 16, pp. 6839-6852; Ashburner, M., Ball, C.A., Blake, J.A., Botstein, D., Butler, H., Cherry, J.M., Davis, A.P., Sherlock, G., Gene ontology: tool for the unification of biology.

Such effects have been reported for local HDAC inhibition in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and amygdala. However, the effect of HDAC inhibition within the medial prefrontal cortex, which is integral to depression-related symptoms and their treatment, remains unknown. Here we show that local infusion of the highly selective HDAC inhibitor, MS-275, into the medial prefrontal cortex exerts robust antidepressant-like effects in the chronic social defeat stress paradigm in mice. These findings provide further impetus for the assessment of HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of depression. © 2015 IBRO.","Depression; Gene expression; HDAC inhibitors; MS-275","Abel, T., Zukin, R.S., Epigenetic targets of HDAC inhibition in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders (2008) Curr Opin Pharmacol, 8, pp. 57-64;

Little attention has been given to the modulation of GABA<inf>A</inf> receptors (GABA<inf>A</inf>Rs) by postsynaptic KARs. Recent studies suggest that two GABA<inf>A</inf>R populations, synaptic (sGABA<inf>A</inf>R) and extrasynaptic (eGABA<inf>A</inf>R) GABA<inf>A</inf>Rs, mediate phasic and tonic forms of inhibition, respectively. Tonic inhibition plays an important role in the excitability of neuronal circuits and the occurrence of epileptic seizures. For this study, we are the first to report that the activation of postsynaptic KARs by the KAR agonist, Kainic acid (KA, 5μM), enhanced tonic inhibition by potentiating eGABA<inf>A</inf>Rs. KA enhanced THIP-induced eGABA<inf>A</inf>R currents and prolonged the rise and decay time of muscimol-induced sGABA<inf>A</inf>R/eGABA<inf>A</inf>R currents, but also depressed the amplitude of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), unitary IPSCs (uIPSCs), and muscimol-induced sGABA<inf>A</inf>R/eGABA<inf>A</inf>R currents. The PKC inhibitor, staurosporine (1μM), in the patch pipette solution fully blocked the KA-induced potentiation of tonic inhibition, suggesting the involvement of an intracellular PKC pathway. Our study suggests that the activation of postsynaptic KARs potentiates eGABA<inf>A</inf>Rs but depresses sGABA<inf>A</inf>Rs. By activating postsynaptic KARs, synaptically released glutamate depresses phasic inhibition to facilitate neuronal plasticity, but potentiates tonic inhibition to protect neurons from over-excitation. © 2015 IBRO.","Extrasynaptic GABA<inf>A</inf> receptor;

In order to illuminate dynamical aspects of the longitudinal course of the illness, we propose here a novel complex model based on the notion of competition between recurrent maps, which mathematically represent the dynamics of activation in excitatory (Glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) pathways. We assume that manic and depressive states can be considered stable sub attractors of a dynamical system through which the mood trajectory moves. The model provides a theoretical framework which can account for a number of complex phenomena of bipolar disorder, including intermittent transition between the two poles of the disorder, rapid and ultra-rapid cycling of episodes and manicogenic effects of antidepressants. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Bipolar disorder; Chaotic intermittency; Recurrent map; Winnerless competition","Afraimovich, V., Tristan, I., Huerta, R., Rabinovich, M.I., Winnerless competition principle and prediction of the transient dynamics in a Lotka-Volterra model (2008) Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science, 18, p. 043103; Anand, A., Li, Y., Wang, Y., Lowe, M.J., Dzemidzic, M., Resting state corticolimbic connectivity abnormalities in unmedicated bipolar disorder and unipolar depression (2009) Psychiatry Res.: Neuroimaging, 171, pp. 189-198; Angeli, D., Ferrell, J.E., Sontag, E.D., Detection of multistability, bifurcations, and hysteresis in a large class of biological positive-feedback systems (2004) Proc.

However, the mechanism underlying estrogen modulates depression-like behavior remains largely unknown. Inflammation and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) have been shown to play pivotal roles in various depression models. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether estrogen deficiency-induced depression-like behavior is associated with inflammation and IDO activation in brain. The results showed that ovariectomy resulted in depression-like behavior in female rats and caused a decrease in 5-HT content and an increase in levels of IDO, IFN-γ, IL-6, toll like receptor (TLR)-4 and phosphorylated NF-κB (p65 subunit) in hippocampus but not in prefrontal cortex (PFC). 17β-Estradiol (E<inf>2</inf>) treatment ameliorated depression-like behavior and restored above neurochemical alternations in hippocampus in ovariectomized rats. Partial correlation analysis showed that the levels of phosphorylated p65, IFN-γ and IL-6 in hippocampus correlated to serum E<inf>2</inf> level. Our study suggests that estrogen inhibits inflammation and activates of IDO and maintains 5-HT level in hippocampus, thereby ameliorating depression-like behavior. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Depression; Estrogen; Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO); Inflammation","Kessler, R.C., McGonagle, K.A., Swartz, M., Blazer, D.G., Nelson, C.B., Sex and depression in the National Comorbidity Survey.

Studies have found that exposure to early stressful events is a risk factor for developing PTSD. However, a limited number of studies have explored the effects of traumatic stress in early adolescence on behavior, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, central corticotropin releasing factor receptor 1 (CRFR1) expression and the relative vulnerability of PTSD in adulthood. The current study aims to explore these issues using inescapable electric foot shock to induce a PTSD model in early adolescent rats. Meanwhile, running on a treadmill for six weeks and administration of the antagonist with 3.2. mg/kg/day of CP-154, 526 for 14 consecutive days were used as therapeutic measures. Presently, the stress (S) group showed more anxiety and depression in the open field (OF) test and elevated plus maze (EPM) test, memory damage in the Y maze test, decreased basal CORT level, increased DEX negative feedback inhibition and exacerbated and longer-lasting reaction to CRH challenge in the DEX/CRH test compared with the control group. Central CRFR1 expression was also changed in the S group, as evidenced by the increased CRFR1 expression in the hypothalamus, amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, treadmill exercise alleviated early adolescent stress-induced behavior abnormalities and improved the functional state of the HPA axis, performing a more powerful effect than the CRFR1 antagonist CP-154, 526. Additionally, this study revealed that the alteration of central CRFR1 expression might play an important role in etiology of PTSD in adulthood. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","CRFR1 antagonist; CRFR1 expression; Early adolescence; PTSD; Treadmill exercise","Tarullo, A.R., Gunnar, M.R., Child maltreatment and the developing HPA axis (2006) Horm Behav, 50 (4), pp. 632-639; Santa Ana, E.J., Saladin, M.E., Back, S.E., Waldrop, A.E., Spratt, E.G., McRae, A.L., PTSD and the HPA axis: differences in response to the cold pressor task among individuals with child vs. adult trauma (2006) Psychoneuroendocrinology, 31 (4), pp. 501-509; Yehuda, R., Flory, J.D., Pratchett, L.C., Buxbaum, J., Ising, M., Holsboer, F., Putative biological mechanisms for the association between early life adversity and the subsequent development of PTSD (2010) Psychopharmacology, 212 (3), pp. 405-417; Bowirrat, A., Chen, T.J.H., Blum, K., Madigan, M., Bailey, J.A., Chuan Chen, A.L., Neuro-psychopharmacogenetics and neurological antecedents of posttraumatic stress disorder: unlocking the mysteries of resilience and vulnerability (2010) Curr Neuropharmacol, 8 (4), pp. 335-358; Sherin, J., Nemeroff, C., Post-traumatic stress disorder: the neurobiological impact of psychological trauma (2011) Dialogues Clin Neurosci, 13 (3), pp. 263-278. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3182008/; Yehuda, R., Chapter 3.2 Neuroendocrine aspects of PTSD (2005) Tech Behav Neur Sci, 15, pp. 251-272; Risbrough, V.B., Stein, M.B., Role of corticotropin releasing factor in anxiety disorders: a translational research perspective (2006) Horm Behav, 50 (4), pp. 550-561; Rasmusson, A.M., Lipschitz, D.S., Wang, S., Hu, S., Vojvoda, D., Bremner, J.D., Increased pituitary and adrenal reactivity in premenopausal women with posttraumatic stress disorder (2001) Biol Psychiatry, 50 (12), pp. 965-977; Smith, M.A., Davidson, J., Ritchie, J.C., Kudler, H., Lipper, S., Chappell, P., The corticotropin-releasing hormone test in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (1989) Biol Psychiatry, 26, pp. 349-355; Kellner, M., Yassouridis, A., Hübner, R., Baker, D.G., Wiedemann, K., Endocrine and cardiovascular responses to corticotropin-releasing hormone in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder: A role for atrial natriuretic peptide?

However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation in different vegetation types in the karst region of Southwest China. The goal of this study was to identify and prioritize the effects of environmental parameters, including soil physico-chemical properties, microbial biomass, enzyme activities, and litter characteristics, on SOC accumulation along a vegetation succession sere (grassland, shrubland, secondary forest, and primary forest) in the karst landscape of Southwest China. Relationships between these parameters and SOC were evaluated by redundancy analysis. The results showed that SOC accumulation was significantly different among vegetation types (P&lt;0.01) and increased with vegetation succession (from 29.10g·kg-1 in grassland to 73.92g·kg-1 in primary forest). Soil biochemistry and physical characteristics significantly affected the accumulation of SOC. Soil microbial biomass showed a predominant effect on SOC in each of the four vegetation types. In addition, the soil physical property (especially the silt content) was another controlling factor in the early stages (grassland), and urease activity and saccharase activity were important controlling factors in the early-middle and middle-late stages, respectively. Litter characteristics only showed mild effects on SOC accumulation. Variation partitioning analysis showed that the contribution of sole main factors to SOC variation decreased, while the interaction effect among parameters increased along the succession gradient. •Vegetation restoration is conducive to soil carbon sequestration in karst areas.•The factors controlling SOC accumulation differed along vegetation succession.•The interaction effect among significant factors became more and more prominent along succession. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Enzyme activities; Karst peak-cluster depression; Litter; Microbial biomass; Silt content; Soil organic carbon","Anderson, J.D., Ingram, L.J., Stahl, P.D., Influence of reclamation management practices on microbial biomass carbon and soil organic carbon accumulation in semiarid mined lands of Wyoming (2008) Appl.

Cholinergic activity in the VTA has been demonstrated to regulate phasic DA activity, but the role of VTA cholinergic mechanisms in depression-related behavior is unclear. The goal of this study was to determine whether pharmacological manipulation of VTA cholinergic activity altered behavioral responding in the forced swim test (FST) in rats. Here, male Sprague-Dawley rats received systemic or VTA-specific administration of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine (systemic; 0.06 or 0.125. mg/kg, intra-cranial; 1 or 2. μg/side), the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antagonist scopolamine (2.4 or 24. μg/side), or the nicotinic AChR antagonist mecamylamine (3 or 30. μg/side), prior to the FST test session. In control experiments, locomotor activity was also examined following systemic and intra-cranial administration of cholinergic drugs. Physostigmine administration, either systemically or directly into the VTA, significantly increased immobility time in FST, whereas physostigmine infusion into a dorsal control site did not alter immobility time. In contrast, VTA infusion of either scopolamine or mecamylamine decreased immobility time, consistent with an antidepressant-like effect. Finally, the VTA physostigmine-induced increase in immobility was blocked by co-administration with scopolamine, but unaltered by co-administration with mecamylamine. These data show that enhancing VTA cholinergic tone and blocking VTA AChRs has opposing effects in FST. Together, the findings provide evidence for a role of VTA cholinergic mechanisms in behavioral responses in FST. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Acetylcholine; Forced swim test; Mecamylamine; Physostigmine; Scopolamine;

This hypothesis is based on previous work showing that depression-like behavior in rats treated with protracted corticosterone develops in concert with decreased dendritic complexity in newborn hippocampal granule neurons and decreased reelin expression in the proliferative subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. In addition, heterozygous reeler mice with approximately 50% of normal brain levels of reelin are more vulnerable to the depressogenic effects of corticosterone than wild-type mice. The purpose of this experiment was to provide pharmacological validation for the link between reelin, neuronal maturation, and depression by examining whether the deleterious effects of corticosterone on these measures could be prevented by co-administration of the antidepressant imipramine. Rats received corticosterone injections, corticosterone injections plus either 10 or 15mg/kg imipramine injections, or vehicle injections for 21 consecutive days. They were then subjected to the forced swim test to assess depression-like behavior and sacrificed for immunohistochemical examination of immature neuron number and dendritic complexity and the presence of reelin. +. cells. We found that corticosterone increases depression-like behavior, decreases the number of reelin. +. cells in the subgranular zone, and decreases the number and complexity of immature neurons in the granule cell layer. All of these behavioral and cellular phenotypes were prevented by imipramine, providing further support for the idea that reelin is involved in the pathogenesis of depression. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Antidepressant; Corticosterone; Depression; Neurogenesis; Reelin","Bal, M., Leitz, J., Reese, A.L., Ramirez, D.M., Durakoglugil, M., Herz, J., Reelin mobilizes a VAMP7-dependent synaptic vesicle pool and selectively augments spontaneous neurotransmission (2013) Neuron, 80, pp. 934-946; Bambico, F.R., Belzung, C., Novel insights into depression and antidepressants: a synergy between synaptogenesis and neurogenesis?

These knowledge gaps might result in ineffective therapeutic approaches to relieve painful sensations. As a result, severe untreated chronic pain frequently triggers the onset of new disorders such as depression and/or anxiety, and therefore, both the diagnosis and treatment of patients suffering from chronic pain become seriously compromised, prompting a self-perpetuating cycle of symptomatology. The extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) are molecules strongly implicated in the somatic component of pain at the spinal cord level and have been emerging as mediators of the emotional-affective component as well. Although these molecules might represent good biomarkers, their use as pharmacological targets is still open to discussion as paradoxical information has been obtained. Here we review the current scientific literature regarding ERK1/2 signaling in the modulation of pain, depression and anxiety, including the emotional-affective spheres of the pain experience. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Anxiety; Chronic pain; Depression; Paragigantocellularis-locus coeruleus-prefrontal cortex pathway; PERK1/2","Aguera, L., Failde, I., Cervilla, J.A., Diaz-Fernandez, P., Mico, J.A., Medically unexplained pain complaints are associated with underlying unrecognized mood disorders in primary care (2010) BMC Fam Pract, 11, p. 17; Aguera-Ortiz, L., Failde, I., Mico, J.A., Cervilla, J., Lopez-Ibor, J.J., Pain as a symptom of depression: prevalence and clinical correlates in patients attending psychiatric clinics (2011) J Affect Disord, 130 (1-2), pp. 106-112; Ailing, F., Fan, L., Li, S., Manji, S., Role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase signal transduction pathway in anxiety (2008) J Psychiatr Res, 43 (1), pp. 55-63; Alba-Delgado, C., Borges, G., Sanchez-Blazquez, P., Ortega, J.E., Horrillo, I., Mico, J.A., The function of alpha-2-adrenoceptors in the rat locus coeruleus is preserved in the chronic constriction injury model of neuropathic pain (2011) Psychopharmacology (Berlin), 221 (1), pp. 53-65; Alba-Delgado, C., Llorca-Torralba, M., Horrillo, I., Ortega, J.E., Mico, J.A., Sanchez-Blazquez, P., Chronic pain leads to concomitant noradrenergic impairment and mood disorders (2013) Biol Psychiatry, 73 (1), pp. 54-62; Anand, P., Shenoy, R., Palmer, J.E., Baines, A.J., Lai, R.Y., Robertson, J., Clinical trial of the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor dilmapimod in neuropathic pain following nerve injury (2011) Eur J Pain, 15 (10), pp. 1040-1048; Aston-Jones, G., Shipley, M.T., Chouvet, G., Ennis, M., van Bockstaele, E., Pieribone, V., Afferent regulation of locus coeruleus neurons: anatomy, physiology and pharmacology (1991) Prog Brain Res, 88, pp. 47-75; Aston-Jones, G., Rajkowski, J., Kubiak, P., Valentino, R.J., Shipley, M.T., Role of the locus coeruleus in emotional activation (1996) Prog Brain Res, 107, pp. 379-402; Azevedo, L.F., Costa-Pereira, A., Mendonca, L., Dias, C.C., Castro-Lopes, J.M., Epidemiology of chronic pain: a population-based nationwide study on its prevalence, characteristics and associated disability in Portugal (2012) J Pain, 13 (8), pp. 773-783; Bagnol, D., Lu, X.Y., Kaelin, C.B., Day, H.E., Ollmann, M., Gantz, I., Anatomy of an endogenous antagonist: relationship between Agouti-related protein and proopiomelanocortin in brain (1999) J Neurosci, 19 (18), p.

Its neuroplastic function involves a role in neurite formation, filopodium outgrowth and synaptogenesis through an unknown mechanism. Disruptions in neuroplasticity mechanisms have been shown to play a significant part in the etiology of depression. Thus, the current investigation examined whether GPM6A expression is also altered in human depressed brain. Methods: Expression levels and coexpression patterns of GPM6A, GPM6B, and PLP1 (two other members of PLP/DM20 family) as well as of the neuroplasticity-related genes identified to associate with GPM6A were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in postmortem samples from the hippocampus (. n=. 18) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (. n=. 25) of depressed suicide victims and compared with control subjects (hippocampus n=. 18; PFC n=. 25). Neuroplasticity-related proteins that form complexes with GPM6A were identified by coimmunoprecipitation technique followed by mass spectrometry. Results: Results indicated transcriptional downregulation of GPM6A and GPM6B in the hippocampus of depressed suicides. The expression level of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CAMK2A) and coronin1A (CORO1A) was also significantly decreased. Subsequent analysis of coexpression patterns demonstrated coordinated gene expression in the hippocampus and in the PFC indicating that the function of these genes might be coregulated in the human brain. However, in the brain of depressed suicides this coordinated response was disrupted. Conclusions: Disruption of coordinated gene expression as well as abnormalities in GPM6A and GPM6B expression and expression of the components of GPM6A complexes were detected in the brain of depressed suicides. © 2015 IBRO.","Coexpression analysis; Glycoprotein M6a; MRNA expression; Postmortem; QPCR","Aberg, K., Saetre, P., Jareborg, N., Jazin, E., Human QKI, a potential regulator of mRNA expression of human oligodendrocyte-related genes involved in schizophrenia (2006) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 103, pp. 7482-7487; Alfonso, J., Aguero, F., Sanchez, D.O., Flugge, G., Fuchs, E., Frasch, A.C., Pollevick, G.D., Gene expression analysis in the hippocampal formation of tree shrews chronically treated with cortisol (2004) J Neurosci Res, 78, pp. 702-710; Alfonso, J., Fernandez, M.E., Cooper, B., Flugge, G., Frasch, A.C., The stress-regulated protein M6a is a key modulator for neurite outgrowth and filopodium/spine formation (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 102, pp. 17196-17201; Alfonso, J., Frick, L.R., Silberman, D.M., Palumbo, M.L., Genaro, A.M., Frasch, A.C., Regulation of hippocampal gene expression is conserved in two species subjected to different stressors and antidepressant treatments (2006) Biol Psychiatry, 59, pp. 244-251; Alfonso, J., Pollevick, G.D., Van Der Hart, M.G., Flugge, G., Fuchs, E., Frasch, A.C., Identification of genes regulated by chronic psychosocial stress and antidepressant treatment in the hippocampus (2004) Eur J Neurosci, 19, pp. 659-666; Amada, N., Aihara, K., Ravid, R., Horie, M., Reduction of NR1 and phosphorylated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II levels in Alzheimer's disease (2005) Neuroreport, 16, pp. 1809-1813; Andrus, B.M., Blizinsky, K., Vedell, P.T., Dennis, K., Shukla, P.K., Schaffer, D.J., Radulovic, J., Redei, E.E., Gene expression patterns in the hippocampus and amygdala of endogenous depression and chronic stress models (2012) Mol Psychiatry, 17, pp. 49-61; Aston, C., Jiang, L., Sokolov, B.P., Transcriptional profiling reveals evidence for signaling and oligodendroglial abnormalities in the temporal cortex from patients with major depressive disorder (2005) Mol Psychiatry, 10, pp. 309-322; Barbiero, V.S., Giambelli, R., Musazzi, L., Tiraboschi, E., Tardito, D., Perez, J., Drago, F., Popoli, M., Chronic antidepressants induce redistribution and differential activation of alphaCaM kinase II between presynaptic compartments (2007) Neuropsychopharmacology, 32, pp. 2511-2519; Belmaker, R.H., Agam, G., Major depressive disorder (2008) N Engl J Med, 358, pp. 55-68; Boks, M.P., Hoogendoorn, M., Jungerius, B.J., Bakker, S.C., Sommer, I.E., Sinke, R.J., Ophoff, R.A., Kahn, R.S., Do mood symptoms subdivide the schizophrenia phenotype?

These conditions commonly co-occur and both are associated with significant cognitive impairment. Despite this, few studies have examined the impact on cognitive functioning of co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression. This study aims to critically review findings from peer-reviewed published articles examining neuropsychological test performance among samples of people with co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression. Method A comprehensive literature search was conducted, yielding six studies reporting neuropsychological profiles of people with co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression. Results comparing cognitive functioning of people with this comorbidity to those with alcohol misuse alone, depression alone, healthy controls and published norms were examined as well as those describing the correlation between depressive symptoms and cognitive functioning in people with alcohol use disorders. Results In the majority of instances, the comorbid groups did not differ significantly from those with depression only or alcohol misuse only, nor from healthy controls or published norms. In the cases where a difference in neuropsychological test scores between groups was found, it was not consistently identified across studies. However, visual memory was identified in two studies as being impaired in comorbid samples and is worthy of inclusion in future studies. Limitations Due to the small number of included studies and the large variation in inclusion criteria as well as differing assessment tools and methodologies between studies, the review did not include a quantitative synthesis. Conclusions Research into cognitive deficits among people with singly occurring versus co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression is accumulating. Evidence suggests that the neuropsychological performance among samples with this comorbidity is generally not severely impaired and is unlikely to preclude benefit from treatment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Alcohol; Cognitive function; Comorbidity; Depression; Neurocognition; Systematic review","Aldworth, J., (2009) Results from the 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health National Findings, , DIANE Publishing Rockville, MD; (1978) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition: DSM-III Draft/prepared by the Task Force on Nomenclature and Statistics of the American Psychiatric Association, , APA American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC; (1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV 4th Ed.), , Apa fourth edition American Psychiatric Association Washington, DC; (2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Text Revision: DSM-IV-TR, , Apa American Psychiatric Association; (2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition: DSM-5), , Apa American Psychiatric Publishing Washington, DC; Austin, M.P., Ross, M., Murray, C., O'Carroll, R.E., Ebmeier, K.P., Goodwin, G.M., Cognitive function in major depression (1992) J.

Both conditions are major public health concerns; depression has long been recognised as a prominent cause of disability and burden worldwide, whilst suicide is a misunderstood and complex course of death that strongly impacts the quality of life and mental health of the families and communities left behind. Despite this prevalence the diagnosis of depression and assessment of suicide risk, due to their complex clinical characterisations, are difficult tasks, nominally achieved by the categorical assessment of a set of specific symptoms. However many of the key symptoms of either condition, such as altered mood and motivation, are not physical in nature; therefore assigning a categorical score to them introduces a range of subjective biases to the diagnostic procedure. Due to these difficulties, research into finding a set of biological, physiological and behavioural markers to aid clinical assessment is gaining in popularity. This review starts by building the case for speech to be considered a key objective marker for both conditions; reviewing current diagnostic and assessment methods for depression and suicidality including key non-speech biological, physiological and behavioural markers and highlighting the expected cognitive and physiological changes associated with both conditions which affect speech production. We then review the key characteristics; size, associated clinical scores and collection paradigm, of active depressed and suicidal speech databases. The main focus of this paper is on how common paralinguistic speech characteristics are affected by depression and suicidality and the application of this information in classification and prediction systems. The paper concludes with an in-depth discussion on the key challenges - improving the generalisability through greater research collaboration and increased standardisation of data collection, and the mitigating unwanted sources of variability - that will shape the future research directions of this rapidly growing field of speech processing research. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Automatic assessment; Behavioural markers; Classification; Depression; Paralinguistics; Suicide","Åsberg, M., Neurotransmitters and suicidal behavior (1997) Ann.

However, limited data exists for these associations among older adults especially in terms of relationship quality in partnerships. This study aimed to examine the associations of positive and negative partner interactions and social networks with depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. Methods Nationally-representative, cross-sectional data of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) was analyzed. The analytical sample consisted of 4988 community dwelling adults aged >50 years in spouse/partner relationships. Information on sociodemographics and social relationships were assessed using standard questions. Validated scales for depression and anxiety, and a single-item question for suicidal ideation were used to assess mental health outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between social relationships and depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Results After adjusting for confounders, negative partner interactions were significantly associated with increased likelihood of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, while positive partner interactions were significantly and inversely related to anxiety and suicidal ideation. Higher levels of social integration were significantly associated with lower odds for depression. Limitations Given the cross-sectional nature of the research, no firm conclusions can be made in terms of directions of causality. Conclusion By assessing the available social network of older adults, as well as the areas in their social relationships that need to be addressed, it may be possible for practitioners and policy makers to maximize the benefits of network integration and minimize the potentially harmful aspects of social relationships, thereby improving overall mental health and emotional well-being. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Behavioral and histopathological analysis was performed for examination of the depressive disorders in CMS, left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and CMS after MCAO (MCAO + CMS) in mice. In all depressant screening tests involving open field, sucrose preference, forced swim and Morris water maze test, MCAO + CMS mice showed more significant depressive behaviors than MCAO mice. MCAO + CMS mice also showed distinct deficits in forced swim and Morris water maze test compared with CMS. In the histopathological analysis, prominent atrophic changes were seen in the striatum and midbrain of MCAO treated mice compared with CMS. MCAO + CMS mice showed a decrease of proliferative and differentiated neuronal cells in the striatum and hippocampus with dopaminergic neuronal injuries in the midbrain as compared with CMS and MCAO alone treated mice. Treatment of MCAO. + CMS mice with aripiprazole resulted in reduction of all depressive behaviors examined, particularly in the Morris water maze test. Recovered dopaminergic neuronal injuries in the midbrain and enhanced neurogenesis in the hippocampus were also demonstrated. Our results suggest that CMS after ischemic stroke can lead to severe depressive-like behavior compared with CMS or MCAO alone treated mice via neurodegeneration in the primary lesion and secondary extrafocal sites and degradation of neurogenesis, and these behavioral and histopathological changes are reversed by treatment with aripiprazole. Thus adjunct therapy with an antipsychotic may exert its antidepressant effects via neuroprotection and neurogenesis in CMS-treated ischemic mice. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aripiprazole; Neurogenesis; Neuroprotection;

We assessed the following risk of bias domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, baseline imbalance, blinding, intention-to-treat analysis, selective outcome reporting, and funding. Risks of bias were compared for drug and non-drug trials and according to year of publication (before 1990; from 1990 to 1999; and 2000 to 2010). Results Comparing drug trials (N=775) to non-drug trials (N=73), the proportion of drug trials with low risk of bias seemed superior regarding blinding of participants (p<0.001), blinding of health-care providers (p<0.001), and blinded outcome assessment (p<0.001). Non-drug trials were superior regarding sequence generation (p<0.001), allocation concealment (p=0.002), intention-to-treat analysis (p<0.001), and baseline imbalance (p=0.006). Adequate blinding of data managers (p=0.45), blinding of statisticians (p=0.69), and selective outcome reporting (p=0.55) did not differ. 41.5% of drug trials were funded by for-profit organizations compared to 12.3% of non-drug trials (p<0.001). In drug trials, the risk of bias decreased significantly over time. This did not reach statistical significance in non-drug trials. Limitations This study only included trials published before 2010. Conclusions Included trials were associated with high risks of bias which may distort effect estimates. The risks of bias decreased with time for drug trials. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Surprisingly, few studies have examined factors associated with reduction in emotional clarity for adolescents, such as depressed mood and ruminative response styles. The present study examined rumination as a potential mediator of the relationship between depressive symptoms and changes in emotional clarity, focusing on sex differences. Participants included 223 adolescents (51.60% female, Mean age=12.39). Controlling for baseline levels of emotional clarity, initial depressive symptoms predicted decreases in emotional clarity. Further, rumination prospectively mediated the relationship between baseline depressive symptoms and follow-up emotional clarity for girls, but not boys. Findings suggest that depressive symptoms may increase girls' tendencies to engage in repetitive, negative thinking, which may reduce the ability to understand and label emotions, a potentially cyclical process that confers vulnerability to future depression. © 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.","Adolescence; Depression; Emotional clarity; Rumination","Abela, J.R.Z., Hankin, B.L., Cognitive vulnerability to depression in children and adolescents: a developmental psychopathology perspective (2008) Handbook of depression in children and adolescents, pp. 35-78. , Guilford, New York, J.R.Z.

The aim of this paper is to review the impact of folate status on the risk of development of neuropsychiatric disorders in older individuals. The prevalence of folate deficiency is high among individuals aged ≥65 years mainly due to reduced dietary intake and intestinal malabsorption. Population-based studies have demonstrated that a low folate status is associated with mild cognitive impairment, dementia (particularly Alzheimer's disease) and depression in healthy and neuropsychiatric diseased older individuals. The proposed mechanisms underlying that association include hyperhomocysteinemia, lower methylation reactions and tetrahydrobiopterin levels, and excessive misincorporation of uracil into DNA. However, currently, there is no consistent evidence demonstrating that folic acid supplementation improves cognitive function or slows cognitive decline in healthy or cognitively impaired older individuals. In conclusion, folate deficiency seems to be an important contributor for the onset and progression of neuropsychiatric diseases in the geriatric population but additional studies are needed in order to increase the knowledge of this promising, but still largely unexplored, area of research. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aging; B-vitamin supplements; Dementia; Depression; Folate; Homocysteine","Agarwal, E., Miller, M., Yaxley, A., Isenring, E., Malnutrition in the elderly: a narrative review (2013) Maturitas, 76, pp. 296-302; Allen, L.H., How common is vitamin B-12 deficiency?

Method: We identified relevant randomised controlled trials from searching MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and ProQuest, searching reference and citation lists, and contacting study authors. We conducted a meta-analysis of relapse outcomes. Results: There were 29 eligible trials. 27 two-way comparisons including 2742 participants were included in the primary analysis. At 12. months cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) were associated with a 22% reduction in relapse compared with controls (95% CI 15% to 29%). The effect was maintained at 24. months for CBT, but not for IPT despite ongoing sessions. There were no 24-month MBCT data. A key area of heterogeneity differentiating these groups was prior acute treatment. Other psychological therapies and service-level programmes varied in efficacy. Conclusion and implications: Psychological interventions may prolong the recovery a person has achieved through use of medication or acute psychological therapy. Although there was evidence that MBCT is effective, it was largely tested following medication, so its efficacy following psychological interventions is less clear. IPT was only tested following acute IPT. Further exploration of sequencing of interventions is needed.

However, the unique and interactive effects of MDD and hypertension have never been studied in a single sample. Brain volume in these areas may be an explanatory link in the comorbidity between MDD and hypertension. Voxel-based morphometry was used to test for main effects of MDD (N = 152) and hypertension (N = 82) and their interactions on gray and white matter volumes. Voxel-wise results are reported at p <.05 FWE corrected for the spatial extent of the whole brain and a-priori regions of interest (ROIs: hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)). In addition, analyses on the extracted total volumes of our ROIs were performed. Interactive effects in the mid-cingulate cortex (MCC) (p<inf>FWE</inf> =.01), cerebellum (p<inf>FWE</inf> =.01) and in the ACC total ROI volume (p =.02) were found. MDD in the presence, but not in the absence of hypertension was associated with lower volumes in the ACC and MCC, and with a trend towards larger gray matter volume in the cerebellum. No associations with white matter volumes were observed. Results suggest that the combination of MDD and hypertension has a unique effect on brain volumes in areas implicated in the regulation of emotional and autonomic functions. Brain volume in these regulatory areas may be an explanatory link in the comorbidity between hypertension and MDD. © 2015 The Authors.","Blood pressure; Comorbidity; Depression; Gray matter; Hypertension; MRI","Abe, O., Yamasue, H., Kasai, K., Yamada, H., Aoki, S., Inoue, H., Takei, K., Ohtomo, K., Voxel-based analyses of gray/white matter volume and diffusion tensor data in major depression (2010) Psychiatry Res, 181 (1), pp. 64-70. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19959342; Alexopoulos, G.S., Meyers, B.S., Young, R.C., Campbell, S., Silbersweig, D., Charlson, M., 'Vascular depression' hypothesis (1997) Arch.

In the present study, we investigated the mechanism regulating antidepressant effects of exercise by focusing on the role of the amygdala using a well-defined animal model of depression. C57BL/6 mice treated with repeated restraint showed depression-like behaviors, which was counteracted by post-stress treatment with physical exercise. The two neuropeptides hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt/Orx) and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) were transcriptionally upregulated in the BLA after repeated stress, and their enhanced expression was downregulated by treatment with exercise, mirroring stress-induced depression-like behaviors and their reversal by exercise. Stereotaxic injection of either Hcrt/Orx peptide or MCH peptide within the BLA commonly increased phospho-CaMKIIα level and produced depression-like behaviors, mimicking the neural states in the BLA of mice subjected to repeated stress. In contrast, siRNA-mediated suppression of Hcrt/Orx or MCH in the BLA blocked stress-induced depression-like behaviors. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated inhibition of CaMKIIα in the BLA also counteracted stress-induced depression-like behaviors. Local injection of Hcrt/Orx peptide or MCH peptide within the BLA in exercise-treated animals blocked antidepressant-like effects of exercise. Together these results suggest that exercise produces antidepressant effects via suppression of Hcrt/Orx and MCH neural systems in the BLA. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","BLA; Depression; Exercise; Hypocretin/orexin; Melanin-concentrating hormone; Stress","Allard, J.S., Stereological analysis of the hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin neurons in an animal model of depression (2004) Neuropeptides, 38, pp. 311-315; Arendt, D.H., Depressive behavior and activation of the orexin/hypocretin system (2013) Behav.

Nonetheless, there is no consensus on whether or how religiosity could impact and protect against depression. The present study evaluated the association between intrinsic religiosity and resilient psychological characteristics in depressed inpatients. Methods A sample of 143 depressed patients was prospectively evaluated in an inpatient psychiatric treatment in South Brazil. High Intrinsic Religiosity (HIR) and Low Intrinsic Religiosity (LIR) patients were compared across socio-demographic information, clinical measures, religiosity, resilience and quality of life. A linear regression model was used to evaluate the association between intrinsic religiosity and resilience, and the Cohen d test was utilized to assess effect sizes. Results At admission, HIR patients showed higher HAM-D (p=0.05), BPRS (p=0.02), GAF (p=0.02), and CGI (p=0.03) scores, lower educational levels (p=0.04), higher social support (p=0.05), and fewer previous suicide attempts (p=0.05). At discharge, HIR patients showed higher quality of life (p=0.001) and higher resilience (p=0.000), with a large effect size difference between groups (1.02). Based on a linear regression model (adjusted r=0.19, p=0.000), intrinsic religiosity was associated with resilience, controlling for covariates. Conclusion In a sample of depressed inpatients, intrinsic religiosity was found to be associated with resilience, quality of life, and fewer previous suicide attempts. These findings support the relevance of religiosity assessments in mental health practice and support the hypothesis that resilient psychological characteristics may mediate the positive effects of intrinsic religiosity in depression. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The present article provides a critical review of CAM use for depressive disorders including bipolar depression by addressing prevalence of CAM use and CAM users' characteristics, motivation, decision-making and communication with healthcare providers. Methods A comprehensive search of 2003-2014 international literature in the Medline, CINAHL, AMED, and SCOPUS databases was conducted. The search was confined to peer-reviewed articles published in English with abstracts and reporting new empirical research findings regarding CAM use and depressive disorders. Results A considerable level of CAM use was observed among both general and clinical populations of people suffering from depressive disorders, many of whom use CAM concurrently with their conventional medicine. In particular, high rates of CAM use were found among those with bipolar disorder, an illness known to cause substantial impairments in health-related quality of life. Concomitant prescription medication use ranged from 0.52% to as high as 100%. Limitations Study design such as the inclusion of bipolar and depression in the same diagnostic category hamper the differentiation and attribution of CAM usage for symptoms. Conclusion Findings of our review show that enduring impairments in function and persistence of symptoms (as reflected by increased CAM use proportional to severity of illness and comorbidity) are the impetus for sufferers of depressive illness to seek out CAM. The psychosocial factors associated with CAM use in depressive illnesses and severe mental illness are yet to be established. Subsequent research amongst those with depressive disorders would be informative in clarifying the range of motivations associated with mental illness. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Noise annoyance is the most frequent response to environmental noise. Noise annoyance has been shown to modify the association of transport noise exposure on CVD and noise sensitivity moderates the annoyance response to noise. This study uses prospective data from phases 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 in 3630 male and female civil servants from the UK Whitehall II Study to examine whether a single question on noise sensitivity measured by annoyance responses to noise in general predicts physical and mental ill-health and mortality. Non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke morbidity over the follow-up were defined by MONICA criteria based on study ECGs, hospital records, hospital admission statistics or General Practitioner confirmation. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and psychological distress by the General Health questionnaire (GHQ). There was no association between noise sensitivity and CVD morbidity or mortality except in people from lower employment grades where there was an association with angina. Noise sensitivity was a consistent predictor of depressive symptoms and psychological distress at phases 3, 5 and 7. High noise sensitivity scores at baseline predicted GHQ caseness at phase 3 adjusting for age, sex, employment grade, self-rated health and GHQ caseness at baseline (OR. = 1.56 95% CI 1.29-1.88). Noise sensitivity has been identified as a predictor of mental ill-health. More longitudinal research is needed including measures of noise exposure. © 2015.","Annoyance; Coronary heart disease; Depression; Mortality; Noise; Sensitivity","Babisch, W., Road traffic noise and cardiovascular risk (2008) Noise Health, 10, pp. 27-33; Babisch, W., Pershagen, G., Selander, J., Noise annoyance-a modifier of the association between noise level and cardiovascular health?

The current study evaluated the short-term prospective relationship between cybervictimization and adolescents' symptoms of social anxiety and depression over a six-week period. Participants were 839 high-school aged adolescents (14-18 years; 58% female; 73% Hispanic White), who completed measures of traditional peer victimization, cybervictimization, depression, and social anxiety at two time points. Findings supported the distinctiveness of cybervictimization as a unique form of peer victimization. Furthermore, only cybervictimization was associated with increased levels of depressive symptoms over time, and only relational victimization was associated with increased social anxiety over time, after controlling for the comorbidity of social anxiety and depression among youth. Cybervictimization appears to be a unique form of victimization that contributes to adolescents' depressive symptoms and may be important to target in clinical and preventive interventions for adolescent depression. © 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.","Adolescents; Cyber victimization; Depression; Peer victimization; Social anxiety","Adams, R.E., Bukowski, W.M., Peer victimization as a predictor of depression and body mass index in obese and non-obese adolescents (2008) Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 49, pp. 858-866; Berne, S., Frisén, A., Schultze-Krumbholz, A., Scheithauer, H., Naruskov, K., Luik, P., Cyberbullying assessment instruments: a systematic review (2013) Aggression and Violent Behavior, 18 (2), pp. 320-334; Brown, J.D., Bobkowski, P.S., Older and newer media: patterns of use and effects on adolescents' health and well-being (2011) Journal of Research on Adolescence, 21, pp. 95-113; Carlo, G., Knight, G., McGinley, M., Zamboanga, B., Jarvis, L., The multidimensionality of prosocial behaviors and evidence of measurement equivalence in Mexican American and European American early adolescents (2010) Journal of Research on Adolescence, 20, pp. 334-358; Chabrol, H., Montovany, A., Chouicha, K., DuConge, E., Study of the CES-D on a sample of 1,953 adolescent students (2002) Encephale, 28, pp. 429-432; Clark, L.A., Watson, D., Tripartite model of anxiety and depression: psychometric evidence and taxonomic implications (1991) Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 100, pp. 316-336; Cummings, C.M., Caporino, N.E., Kendall, P.C., Comorbidity of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents: 20 years after (2014) Psychological Bulletin, , Nov; De Los Reyes, A., Prinstein, M.J., Applying depression-distortion hypotheses to the assessment of peer victimization in adolescents (2004) Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, 33, pp. 325-335; Del Rey, R., Elipe, P., Ortega-Ruiz, R., Bullying and cyberbullying: overlapping and predictive value of the co-occurrence (2012) Psicothema, 24, pp. 608-613; Dempsey, A., Sulkowski, M., Nichols, R., Storch, E., Differences between peer victimization in cyber and physical settings and associated psychosocial adjustment in early adolescence (2009) Psychology in the Schools, 46, pp. 962-972; Ehrenreich-May, J., Queen, A.H., Bilek, E.L., Remmes, C.S., Marciel, K.K., The unified protocols for the treatment of emotional disorders in children and adolescents (2014) Transdiagnostic treatments for children and adolescents: Principles and practice, pp. 267-292. , Guilford Press, New York, J.

We examined mediation models in which high levels of external pressure predict depression and anxiety symptoms, which may be mediated by low levels of self-exigency and high levels of negative self-evaluation. A sample of 2537 Spanish children completed the Child Perfectionism Inventory and the Clinical-Educative Questionnaire: Anxiety and Depression. The results indicated a predictive effect of external pressure on anxiety and depression symptoms, which was mediated by both low self-exigency and high negative self-evaluation. Our results suggest that dimensions of perfectionism play a critical role in psychopathological symptoms. Therefore, we recommend an increased focus on external pressure, self-exigency and negative self-evaluation to provide a better understanding of child psychopathologies. © 2015.","Anxiety; Children perfectionism; Depression; Moderation model","Abramson, L.Y., Seligman, M.E.P., Teasdale, J.D., Learned helplessness in humans: Critique and reformulation (1978) Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 87, pp. 49-74; Ang, R.P., Huan, V.S., Academic Expectations Stress Inventory: Development, factor analysis, reliability, and validity (2006) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 66, pp. 522-539; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ; Beck, A.T., Rush, A.J., Shaw, B.F., Emery, G., (1979) Cognitive therapy of depression, , Guilford Press, New York; (2013), 62 (2). , http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/ind2013_su.html, (May).

Although latent class growth analyses (LCGA) have been used to explain course-heterogeneity, such analyses have failed to also account for symptom-heterogeneity of depressive symptoms. Therefore, the aim was to identify more specific data-driven subgroups based on patterns of course-trajectories on different depressive symptom domains. Methods In primary care MDD patients (n=205), the presence of the MDD criterion symptoms was determined for each week during a year. Weekly 'mood/cognition' (MC) and 'somatic' (SOM) scores were computed and parallel processes-LCGA (PP-LCGA) was used to identify subgroups based on the course on these domains. The classes associations with baseline predictors and 2-/3-year outcomes were investigated. Results PP-LCGA identified four classes: quick recovery, persisting SOM, persisting MC, and persisting SOM+MC (chronic). Persisting SOM was specifically predicted by higher baseline somatic symptomatology and somatization, and was associated with more somatic depressive symptomatology at long-term follow-up. Persisting MC was specifically predicted by higher depressive severity, thinking insufficiencies, neuroticism, loneliness and lower self-esteem, and was associated with lower mental health related quality of life and more mood/cognitive depressive symptomatology at follow-up. Limitations The sample was small and contained only primary care MDD patients. The weekly depression assessments were collected retrospectively at 3-month intervals. Conclusions The results indicate that there are two specific prototypes of depression, characterized by either persisting MC or persisting SOM, which have different sets of associated prognostic factors and long-term outcomes, and could have different etiological mechanisms. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Depression; Dimensions; Latent class growth analysis; Persistence; Prototypes; Subtypes","Anderson, G., Berk, M., Maes, M., Biological phenotypes underpin the physio-somatic symptoms of somatization, depression, and chronic fatigue syndrome (2014) Acta Psychiatr.

Method In Study One, 489 participants completed a survey on food choice and habits, including questions that asked participants to self-identify as picky eaters. Picky and non-picky eaters were compared on their rates of endorsement of a range of food selection behaviors and attitudes. In Study Two, participants who identified as either picky or non-picky responded to questionnaire measures of obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, disordered eating symptoms, disgust sensitivity, and food and general neophobia. Participants also rated the intensity of bitter and sweet solutions at three concentrations on a Labeled Magnitude Scale. Results In Study One, picky eaters were more likely to endorse a variety of anomalous eating behaviors and attitudes toward food, including rejection of foods based on sensory characteristics (taste, color, texture). Picky eaters were less likely to endorse enjoyment of eating, and more likely to report that they were unhealthy eaters. In Study Two, picky eaters had significantly higher OCD symptoms, disgust sensitivity, and food neophobia than non-picky eaters, and were more likely to score within the clinical range of depression symptoms, but did not have higher scores on measures of disordered eating or general neophobia. Picky eaters rated both bitter and sweet tastants as more intense than did non-picky eaters.

Young people evaluated exclusion of peers with ADHD or depression from dyads and groups, with the exception of group exclusion of the peer with ADHD, as mostly unfair. Beliefs about the fairness of exclusion were influenced by the attributions that they applied to the target peer's behaviour, social obligations and loyalty within friendships and concerns about the adverse psychological effects of exclusion. Furthermore, their evaluations were influenced by personal beliefs about the social and personal costs of including the target peer.

As in humans, DBS applied to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex of rats induces antidepressant-like responses. Physiological interactions between structures that play a role in depression and antidepressant treatment are still unknown. The present study examined the effect of DBS on inter-region communication by measuring the coherence of local field potentials in the rat infralimbic cortex (IL; homologue of the SCG) and one of its major afferents, the ventral hippocampus (VH). Rats received daily IL DBS treatment (100. μA, 90. μs, 130. Hz; 8. h/day). Recordings were conducted in unrestrained, behaving animals on the day before treatment, after 1 and 10. days of treatment, and 10. days stimulation offset. VH-IL coherence in the 2-4. Hz range was reduced in DBS-treated animals compared with shams after 10. days, but not after only 1. day of treatment. No effect of DBS was observed in the 6-10. Hz (theta) range, where coherence was generally high and could be further evoked with a loud auditory stimulus. Finally, coherence was not affected by fluoxetine (10. mg/kg), suggesting that the effects of DBS were not likely mediated by increased serotonin levels. While these data support the hypothesis that DBS disrupts communication between regions important for expectation-based control of emotion, they also suggest that lasting physiological effects require many days of treatment and, furthermore, may be specific to lower-frequency patterns, the nature and scope of which await further investigation. © 2015.","Delta; Depression; Functional connectivity; Oscillations; Synchrony","Adhikari, A., Topiwala, M.A., Gordon, J.A., Synchronized activity between the ventral hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex during anxiety (2010) Neuron, 65, pp. 257-269; Bayer, H.M., Lau, B., Glimcher, P.W., Statistics of midbrain dopamine neuron spike trains in the awake primate (2007) J.

There is, however, a lack of longitudinal studies about the relationship between PPD and changes in physiological status and social role postpartum. Methods We enrolled longitudinally 65 Japanese mothers (36 primiparas) and measured their psychological responses at 1 week, 1 month, and 4 months postpartum. The physiological indicators were three urine catecholamine fraction levels, cortisol levels, and heart-rate variability. We used the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and 28-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) for psychological evaluation.

This study aimed to use the QCD to evaluate the difficulties in daily functioning experienced by children with depressive disorders. Methods A case-control design was used. The cases comprised 90 junior high school students with depressive disorder, whereas a community sample of 363 junior high school students was enrolled as controls. Behaviors were assessed using the QCD, Depression Self-Rating Scale (DSRS), Tokyo Autistic Behavior Scale (TABS), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-rating scale (ADHD-RS), and Oppositional Defiant Behavior Inventory (ODBI). We then analyzed the effects of sex and diagnosis on the QCD scores as well as the correlation coefficients between the QCD and the other questionnaires. Results We included 90 cases (33 boys, 57 girls) with depressive disorders and 363 controls (180 boys, 183 girls). The QCD scores for the children with depressive disorders were significantly lower compared with those from the community sample (P<0.001). The morning, school-time, and night subscores of the QCD were lower for the children with both depressive disorders and truancy problems than for those with depressive disorders alone (P<0.001). Significant correlations were observed between the following: the night QCD subscore and the DSRS scores among boys, the morning QCD subscore and ADHD-RS inattention scores for all groups, and the evening QCD subscore and the TABS score. Conclusions Parents reported that children with depressive disorders experienced greater difficulties in completing basic daily activities compared with community controls. These difficulties were dependent on sex, symptoms, and the time of day. The use of QCD to assess children with depressive disorders enables clinicians to clarify the time periods at which the children face difficulties. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Methods 931 veterans from a random digit dial survey conducted July 2012-June 2013 in the Commonwealth of Kentucky was utilized to examine associations between suicide exposure and depression and anxiety. For those with lifetime suicide exposure, perceptions of closeness to the decedent and additional traumatic death exposure were also examined. Results Almost half of veterans (47.1%, n=434) reported lifetime exposure to suicide. Suicide-exposed individuals were almost twice as likely to have diagnosable depression (OR=1.92, CI=1.31-2.8) and more than twice as likely to have diagnosable anxiety (OR=2.37, CI=1.55-3.61). Suicide-exposed were also more likely than non-exposed to report suicide ideation (9.9% vs. 4.3%). Perceived closeness to decedent increased the odds of depression (OR=1.38, CI=1.12-1.69), anxiety (OR=1.51, CI=1.21-1.89) and PTSD (OR=1.65, CI=1.27-2.16) and more than doubled the odds of Prolonged Grief (OR=2.47, CI=1.60-3.83). A model examined time sequence of suicide and traumatic death exposure. Experiencing a suicide exposure first and subsequent traumatic death exposure in their military career almost quadrupled the odds of suicide ideation (OR=3.56, p=.01, CI=1.34-9.46). Limitations Major study limitations include use of only one US state and random digit dial response rate. Conclusions Suicide exposure confers psychiatric risks in veterans. Perceptions of closeness to decedents, which may extend beyond familial lines, may heighten these risks in the suicide exposed. Multiple exposures to suicide and traumatic death may lead to significant suicide risk. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Exposure; Suicide; Veteran","Blumberg, S., Luke, J., Ganesh, N., Wireless substitution: State-level estimates from the National Health Interview Survey, 2010-2011 (2012) National Health Statistics Reports, 61. , National Center for Health Statistic Hyattsville, MD; Bolton, J.M., Au, W., Leslie, W.D., Martens, P.J., Enns, M.W., Roos, L.L., Sareen, J., Parents bereaved by offspring suicide: A population-based longitudinal case-control study.

Though the precise mechanisms underlying the antidepressant-related effects of NMDAR antagonism remain unclear, recent studies implicate specific NMDAR subunits, including GluN2A and GluN2B, as well as the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunit glutamate receptor interacting molecule, PSD-95. Here, integrating mutant and pharmacological in mice, we investigated the contribution of these subunits and molecules to antidepressant-related behaviors and the antidepressant-related effects of the GluN2B blocker, Ro 25-6981. We found that global deletion of GluA1 or PSD-95 reduced forced swim test (FST) immobility, mimicking the antidepressant-related effect produced by systemically administered Ro 25-6981 in C57BL/6J mice. Moreover, the FST antidepressant-like effects of systemic Ro 25-6981 were intact in mutants with global GluA1 deletion or GluN1 deletion in forebrain interneurons, but were absent in mutants constitutively lacking GluN2A or PSD-95. Next, we found that microinfusing Ro 25-6981 into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but not basolateral amygdala, of C57BL/6J mice was sufficient to produce an antidepressant-like effect. Together, these findings extend and refine current understanding of the mechanisms mediating antidepressant-like effects produced by NMDAR-GluN2B antagonists, and may inform the development of a novel class of medications for treating depression that target the GluN2B subtype of NMDAR. © 2015.","Depression;

However, it is not clear how these relationships develop, and what factors can foster resilience to both conditions. The current study draws on longitudinal cohort data to investigate: 1) the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between problem gambling and internalising symptoms; 2) whether there are common and/or specific social environmental factors protective against both internalising symptoms and problem gambling in young adulthood; and 3) interactive protective factors (i.e., those that moderate the relationship between problem gambling and internalising symptoms). Methods: A sample of 2248 young adults (55% female) completed a survey in 2010 (T1) and 2012 (T2) which assessed problem gambling (measured via two items based on established measures), internalising symptoms, and social environmental protective factors. Results: A positive cross-sectional relationship between problem gambling and internalising symptoms was found; however, there was no statistically significant longitudinal relationship between the two conditions. Protective factors for internalising symptoms were observed within the domains of the community, family and peer group; however, there were no statistically significant protective factors identified for problem gambling. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the social environmental protective factors for adult internalising symptoms assessed in the present study are poor longitudinal predictors of young adult problem gambling. Given the lack of common protective factors, it may be necessary to focus on separate factors to protect against each condition, if we are to address the comorbidity between problem gambling and internalising symptoms. © 2015 .","Depression; Internalising symptoms; Longitudinal; Problem gambling; Protective factors","Abbott, M.W., Clarke, D., Prospective problem gambling research: Contribution and potential (2007) International Gambling Studies, 7 (1), pp. 123-144; (2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , Author, Washington, DC; Bili, R., Stone, C.A., Marden, P., Yeung, K., (2014) The Victorian Gambling Study: A longitudinal study of gambling and health in Victoria, 2008-2012; Blaszczynski, A., Farrell, E., A case series of 44 completed gambling-related suicides (1998) Journal of Gambling Studies, 14, pp. 93-109; Blaszczynski, A., Nower, L., A pathways model of problem and pathological gambling (2002) Addiction, 97, pp. 487-499; Bond, L., Toumbourou, J.W., Thomas, S.A., Catalano, R.F., Patton, G.C., Individual, family, school and community risk and protective factors for depressive symptoms in adolescents: A comparison of risk profiles for substance use and depressive symptoms (2005) Prevention Science, 6 (2), pp. 73-88; Bronfenbrenner, U., Ecological models of human development (1993) Readings on the development of children, pp. 37-43. , Freeman, NY, M.

Few studies have examined alcohol use among adults living in Israel under chronic, stressful terrorism-related conditions. In this study, we examined the relationships of demographics, past stressful events, and terrorism exposure to the frequency of alcohol use and the mediating roles of depressive and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. We used three waves of data from a 2007-2008 nationally representative sample of Jewish and Palestinian adults in Israel. We assessed past stressful events, in addition to direct and indirect exposures to terrorism. Results indicated that past stressful events and exposure to terrorism were not directly associated with alcohol use, but were indirectly associated and mediated by depressive and PTSD symptomology. Mental health symptoms were differentially associated with alcohol use. More frequent drinking was mediated by higher levels of depression, including for women and Palestinians; however, PTSD symptom severity was related to less frequent drinking. Mental health may play a prominent role in the frequency of alcohol use among adults exposed to terrorism in Israel. Alcohol use, as a coping mechanism, may differ by demographic characteristics (gender and ethnicity) and psychological symptomology for adults living in a conflict zone in Israel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Alcohol consumption;

Methods We included 314 subjects with depression and bipolar depression, with and without the MetS and TUD and computed insulin resistance using the updated homeostasis model assessment (HOMA2IR) and atherogenicity using the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), that is log10 (triglycerides/high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Results HOMA2IR is correlated with body mass index (BMI) and uric acid levels, but not with mood disorders and TUD, while the AIP is positively associated with BMI, mood disorders, TUD, uric acid, MDA and male sex. Uric acid is positively associated with insulin and triglycerides and negatively with HDL cholesterol. MDA is positively associated with triglyceride levels. Comorbid mood disorders and TUD further increase AIP but not insulin resistance. Glucose is positively associated with increasing age, male gender and BMI. Discussion The results show that mood disorders, TUD and BMI together with elevated levels of uric acid and MDA independently contribute to increased atherogenic potential, while BMI and uric acid are risk factors for insulin resistance. The findings show that mood disorders and TUD are closely related to an increased atherogenic potential but not to insulin resistance or the MetS. Increased uric acid is a highly significant risk factor for insulin resistance and increased atherogenic potential. MDA, a marker of lipid peroxidation, further contributes to different aspects of the atherogenic potential. Mood disorders and TUD increase triglyceride levels, lower HDL cholesterol and are strongly associated with the atherogenic, but not insulin resistance, component of the MetS. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,"Albert, U., De Cori, D., Aguglia, A., Barbaro, F., Bogetto, F., Maina, G., Increased uric acid levels in bipolar disorder subjects during different phases of illness (2015) J.

Ketamine, a NMDA antagonist used extensively as a pediatric and veterinary anesthetic, has recently been shown to be a rapid acting antidepressant, making it a potential lifesaver for suicidal patients. Side effects and risk of abuse limit the chronic use of ketamine. More complete understanding of the neurobiochemical mechanisms of ketamine should lead to safer alternatives. Some of the physiological and pharmacological actions of ketamine are consistent with increased synthesis and release of TRH (pGlu-His-Pro-NH<inf>2</inf>), and TRH-like peptides (pGlu-X-Pro-NH<inf>2</inf>) where ""X"" can be any amino acid residue. Moreover, TRH-like peptides are themselves potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of major depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. For these reasons, male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with 162 mg/kg ip ketamine and then infused intranasally with 20 μl of sterile saline containing either 0 or 5 mg/ml Glu-TRH. One, 2 or 4 h later, the brain levels of TRH and TRH-like peptides were measured in various brain regions and peripheral tissues. At 1 h in brain following ketamine only, the levels of TRH and TRH-like peptides were significantly increased in 52 instances (due to increased biosynthesis and/or decreased release) or decreased in five instances. These changes, listed by brain region in order of decreasing number of significant increases (↑) and/or decreases (↓), were: hypothalamus (9↑); piriform cortex (8↑); entorhinal cortex (7↑); nucleus accumbens (7↑); posterior cingulate (5↑); striatum (4↑); frontal cortex (2↑,3↓); amygdala (3↑); medulla oblongata (1↑,2↓); cerebellum (2↑); hippocampus (2↑); anterior cingulate (2↑). The corresponding changes in peripheral tissues were: adrenals (8↑); epididymis (4↑); testis (1↑,3↓); pancreas (1↑); prostate (1↑). We conclude that TRH and TRH-like peptides may be downstream mediators of the rapid antidepressant actions of ketamine.","Anxiety; Depression; Limbic system; Neuroendocrine","Arnold, M., Langhan, W., Effects of anesthesia and blood sampling techniques on plasma metabolites and corticosterone in the rat (2010) Physiol Behav, 99, pp. 592-598; Autry, A.E., Adachi, M., Nosyreva, E., Na, E.S., Los, M.F., Cheng, P.-F., NMDA receptor blockade at rest triggers rapid behavioral antidepressant responses (2011) Nature, 475, pp. 91-97; Ballard, E.D., Ionescu, D.F., Vande Voort, J.L., Niciu, M.J., Richards, E.M., Luckenbaugh, D.A., Improvement in suicidal ideation after ketamine infusion: Relationship to reductions in depression and anxiety (2014) J Psychiatr Res, 58, pp. 161-166; Bojak, I., Day, H.C., Liley, D.T.J., Ketamine, propofol, and the EEG: A neural field analysis of HCN1-mediated interactions (2013) Front Comput Neurosci, , DOI 3389/fncom.2013.00022; Bowker, A.H., Lieberman, G.J., (1959) Engineering Statistics, , Prentice-Hall, Inc.

We have recently shown that depression-like behavior induced by dietary zinc restriction is associated with up-regulation of hippocampal N-methyl-. d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Here we examined the effects of chronic administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (FLX), on behavioral and biochemical alterations (within NMDAR signaling pathway) induced by zinc deficiency. Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a zinc adequate diet (ZnA, 50. mg Zn/kg) or a zinc deficient diet (ZnD, 3. mg Zn/kg) for 4 weeks. Then, FLX treatment (10. mg/kg, i.p.) begun. Following 2 weeks of FLX administration the behavior of the rats was examined in the forced swim test (FST) and the spontaneous locomotor activity test. Twenty four hours later tissue was harvested. The proteins of NMDAR (GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B) or AMPAR (GluA1) subunits, p-CREB and BDNF in the hippocampus (Western blot) and serum zinc level (TXRF) were examined. Depression-like behavior induced by ZnD in the FST was sensitive to chronic treatment with FLX. ZnD increased levels of GluN1, GluN2A, GluN2B and decreased pS485-GluA1, p-CREB and BDNF proteins. Administration of FLX counteracted the zinc restriction-induced changes in serum zinc level and hippocampal GluN1, GluN2A, GluN2B and p-CREB but not BDNF or pS845-GluA1 protein levels.

Glutamate-based antidepressants seem to play an important role in therapy for depression, but there is still an extensive search for safe drugs. An antagonist of the glutamatergic NMDA receptor - namely, zinc - plays a part in maintaining homeostasis between glutamate and GABA via the GPR39 receptor, which has been found to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression. In this study we investigated the behavioral response resulting from chronic or acute treatment with monoamine-based antidepressants, such as imipramine, escitalopram or reboxetine, and from glutamate-based MK-801 or ketamine, as measured by the forced swim test (FST) in GPR39 knockout (GPR39 KO, -/-) mice versus wild-type (WT, +/+) controls. All the tested agents reduced the immobility time in the FST in the wild-type animals. However, only chronic or acute administration of MK-801 and ketamine (but not monoamine-based antidepressants) were active in the FST in GPR39 KO mice. Our results show for the first time that GPR39 is required for the antidepressant effect of monoamine-based antidepressants. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Antidepressants; GPR39; Ketamine; MK-801; NMDA; Zinc","Murrough, J.W., Perez, A.M., Pillemer, S., Stern, J., Parides, M.K., Aan het Rot, M., Rapid and longer-term antidepressant effects of repeated ketamine infusions in treatment-resistant major depression (2013) Biol Psychiatry, 74, pp. 250-256; Pilc, A., Wierońska, J.M., Skolnick, P., Glutamate-based antidepressants: preclinical psychopharmacology (2013) Biol Psychiatry, 73, pp. 1125-1132; Paul, I.A., Skolnick, P., Glutamate and depression: clinical and preclinical studies (2003) Ann N Y Acad Sci, 1003, pp. 250-272; Maes, M., Vandoolaeghe, E., Neels, H., Demedts, P., Wauters, A., Meltzer, H.Y., Lower serum zinc in major depression is a sensitive marker of treatment resistance and of the immune/inflammatory response in that illness (1997) Biol Psychiatry, 42, pp. 349-358; Swardfager, W., Herrmann, N., McIntyre, R.S., Mazereeuw, G., Goldberger, K., Cha, D.S., Potential roles of zinc in the pathophysiology and treatment of major depressive disorder (2013) Neurosci Biobehav Rev, 37, pp. 911-929; Siwek, M., Szewczyk, B., Dudek, D., Styczeń, K., Sowa-Kućma, M., Młyniec, K., Zinc as a marker of affective disorders (2013) Pharmacol Rep, 65, pp. 1512-1518; Holst, B., Egerod, K.L., Schild, E., Vickers, S.P., Cheetham, S., Gerlach, L.-O., GPR39 signaling is stimulated by zinc ions but not by obestatin (2007) Endocrinology, 148, pp. 13-20; Jackson, V.R., Nothacker, H.-P., Civelli, O., GPR39 receptor expression in the mouse brain (2006) Neuroreport, 17, pp. 813-816; Besser, L., Chorin, E., Sekler, I., Silverman, W.F., Atkin, S., Russell, J.T., Synaptically released zinc triggers metabotropic signaling via a zinc-sensing receptor in the hippocampus (2009) J Neurosci, 29, pp. 2890-2901; Dawson, T.M., Ginty, D.D., CREB family transcription factors inhibit neuronal suicide (2002) Nat Med, 8, pp. 450-451; Młyniec, K., Singewald, N., Holst, B., Nowak, G., GPR39 Zn(2+)-sensing receptor: a new target in antidepressant development?

Recent work has reported adult rat ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) emitted during intermittent swim stress (ISS) may serve as a predictor of resilience. ISS-induced USVs predicted resilience on several endpoints of behavioral depression and may be considered a forecast of innate resilience. However, a potential problem for these previous findings is the lack of generalizability to other contexts, because both the stress induction and post-stress testing occur in water. The current study tests the generalizability of USVs as a predictor of stress resilience in a non-water-based post-test, the juvenile social exploration test of anxiety.

Clinical observations indicate that infections and chronic lesions are more frequent in drug users and elevated inflammatory states are evident in cocaine dependents. Therefore, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and inflammatory cytokines represent an important tool for the investigation of sickness, depressive illness and addiction behaviour. A major component of addiction is the progressive and persistent increase in locomotor activity after repeated drug administration and even prolonged periods of abstinence. The aim of this study was to investigate the response of locomotor sensitization when a non-sensitizing dose of cocaine is paired with a systemic inflammatory stimulus. LPS and cocaine were administered intraperitonealy in young-adult male C57bl/6 mice during a 5-day acquisition phase. After a 48-h withdrawal period all groups were challenged with cocaine to evaluate locomotor expression. During the acquisition phase, the LPS-treated groups displayed characteristic hypolocomotion related to sickness behaviour. The low dose of cocaine did not increase the distance travelled, characterizing a non-sensitization dose. Groups that received both LPS and cocaine did not display hypolocomotion, indicating that cocaine might counteract hypolocomotion sickness behaviour. Moreover, during challenge, only these animals expressed locomotor sensitization. Our results indicate that LPS could facilitate the expression of locomotor sensitization in mice and that the immune system may modulate cocaine-induced sensitization. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Addiction;

The insular cortex (IC) plays an important role in integrating emotion processing with interoception and has been implicated recently in the pathophysiology of adult and adolescent MDD. However, no studies have yet specifically examined the IC in adolescent MDD during processing of faces in the sad-happy continuum. Thus, the aim of the present study is to investigate the IC during sad and happy face processing in adolescents with MDD compared to healthy controls (HCL). Methods Thirty-one adolescents (22 female) with MDD and 36 (23 female) HCL underwent a well-validated emotional processing fMRI paradigm that included sad and happy face stimuli. Results The MDD group showed significantly less differential activation of the anterior/middle insular cortex (AMIC) in response to sad versus happy faces compared to the HCL group. AMIC also showed greater functional connectivity with right fusiform gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and right amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus in the MDD compared to HCL group. Moreover, differential activation to sad and happy faces in AMIC correlated negatively with depression severity within the MDD group. Limitations Small age-range and cross-sectional nature precluded assessment of development of the AMIC in adolescent depression. Conclusions Given the role of the IC in integrating bodily stimuli with conscious cognitive and emotional processes, our findings of aberrant AMIC function in adolescent MDD provide a neuroscientific rationale for targeting the AMIC in the development of new treatment modalities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the role of this axis in cognition remains relatively unexplored. Probiotics, which are commensal bacteria offering potential health benefit, have been shown to decrease anxiety, depression and visceral pain-related behaviours. In this study, we investigate the potential of two Bifidobacteria strains to modulate cognitive processes and visceral pain sensitivity. Adult male BALB/c mice were fed daily for 11 weeks with B. longum 1714, B. breve 1205 or vehicle treatment. Starting at week 4, animals were behaviourally assessed in a battery of tests relevant to different aspects of cognition, as well as locomotor activity and visceral pain. In the object recognition test, B. longum 1714-fed mice discriminated between the two objects faster than all other groups and B. breve 1205-fed mice discriminated faster than vehicle animals. In the Barnes maze, B. longum 1714-treated mice made fewer errors than other groups, suggesting a better learning. In the fear conditioning, B. longum 1714-treated group also showed better learning and memory, yet presenting the same extinction learning profile as controls. None of the treatments affected visceral sensitivity. Altogether, these data suggest that B. longum 1714 had a positive impact on cognition and also that the effects of individual Bifidobacteria strains do not generalise across the species. Clinical validation of the effects of probiotics on cognition is now warranted. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","BALB/c mice; Behaviour; Bifidobacteria; Cognition; Colorectal distension; Corticosterone","Rhee, S.H., Pothoulakis, C., Mayer, E.A., Principles and clinical implications of the brain-gut-enteric microbiota axis (2009) Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol, 6 (5), pp. 306-314;

Porosity of these materials was additionally characterized by low-temperature nitrogen adsorption and quasi-equilibrated thermodesorption of n-nonane. In general, the pore sizes and pore volumes determined using water and alkanes TMP reveal the same tendency as those calculated with other methods, although the absolute values show some differences. In particular, pore diameters found from water and n-hexane TPM experiments are in most cases smaller in comparison with the results obtained from other methods. On the other hand, in the case of solids with largest pores, the pore diameters found on the basis of n-heptane TPM are significantly overestimated. The values of the pore volume corresponding to the integral intensity of the TPM PSD peaks are smaller than those calculated with other methods. The possible reasons for the observed deviations are discussed. For the first time important differences in the behavior of n-hexane and n-heptane in TPM experiments are reported and attributed to different packing of C6 and C7 alkane molecules in the solidified state due the alternations in the properties of odd and even numbered hydrocarbon chains. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Alkane; Odd-even effect; Pore size distribution; SBA-15; Thermoporosimetry","Taguchi, A., Schuth, F., (2005) Micropor.

This is the first systematic review aimed at examining the association between suicidality and OCD and at providing evidence about psychological mechanisms that may underlie suicidality in those with OCD. Five electronic bibliographic databases were searched up to April 2014: Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science and CINAHL. Meta-analysis using random effects models was conducted. Forty-eight studies were included in the systematic review. The pooled effect size across 30 independent comparisons revealed a moderate to high, significant association between suicidality and OCD (Hedges' g. =. 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.49-0.82) which persisted across different types of suicidality including suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Comorbid Axis I disorders, increased severity of comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms, increased severity of obsessions, feelings of hopelessness and past history of suicide attempts were associated with worsening levels of suicidality in OCD. There was no indication for publication bias but the methodological quality of the studies was low. The theoretical, research and clinical implications of these findings are emphasized. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Comorbidities; Depression; Meta-analysis; Obsessive Compulsive disorder; Suicidality; Systematic review","Alonso, P., Segalas, C., Real, E., Pertusa, A., Labad, J., Jimenez-Murcia, S., Suicide in patients treated for obsessive-compulsive disorder: A prospective follow-up study (2010) Journal of Affective Disorders, 124, pp. 300-308; Angst, J., Gamma, A., Neuenschwander, M., Ajdacic-Gross, V., Eich, D., Rössler, W., Merikangas, K.R., Prevalence of mental disorders in the Zurich Cohort Study: a twenty year prospective stud (2005) Epidemiologia e Psichiatria Sociale, 14, pp. 68-76; (2004) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC; (2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V), , American Psychiatric Association, Washington DC; Anderson, K.E., Gehl, C.R., Marder, K.S., Beglinger, L.J., Paulsen, J.S., Comorbidities of obsessive and compulsive symptoms in huntington's disease (2010) Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 198, pp. 334-338; Angst, J., Gamma, A., Endrass, J., Goodwin, R., Ajdacic, V., Eich, D., Obsessive-compulsive severity spectrum in the community: prevalence, comorbidity, and course (2004) European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience, 254, pp. 156-164; Balci, V., Sevincok, L., Suicidal ideation in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (2010) Psychiatry Research, 175, pp. 104-108; Beautrais, A.L., Suicides and serious suicide attempts: two populations or one?

Slope failure occurred at different periods (Cretaceous to Neogene) and shows an overall retrogressive evolution through time. Upslope these failure headscarp, an enigmatic regional Mio-Pliocene unconformity has been discovered through the interpretation of new academic and industrial datasets. The aim of this work is to describe and understand the origin of this surface. Our analysis shows that this unconformity is made of a series of valleys that cross-cut sedimentary strata. Each one of these valleys has a short lateral extent and is closed along two perpendicular directions, which suggests that it could correspond to a highly meandering system, or to some sub-circular depressions. The infill of these features is equivalent to the regional stratigraphic strata found outside the structures, but in a subdued position. This seems to imply that the structures have originated by a local loss of sediments at their base or by sliding processes. Furthermore, these depressions intersect each other through time, while migrating progressively downslope.We discuss a series of hypotheses that try to explain the onset and evolution of these depressions forming the Mio-Pliocene unconformity (Canyons? Slope failures? Contourite moats? Hydrate pockmarks?). Having established that these structures are depressions formed by collapse, and have many similarities with structures recently described in the literature as pockmarks associated with gas hydrate dissolution, we favor this hypothesis.We propose that these hydrate pockmarks form with a mass failure that was triggered by fluid-overpressure development at the base of the hydrate stability zone. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Canyon; Contourite; Demerara plateau; Hydrate pockmark; Slide; Unconformity; Valley","Basile, C., Maillard, A., Patriat, M., Gaullier, V., Loncke, L., Roest, W., Mercier de Lépinay, M., Pattier, F., Structure and evolution of the Demerara Plateau, offshore French Guiana: rifting, tectonic inversion and post-rift tilting at transform-divergent margins intersection (2013) Tectonophysics, 591, pp. 16-29; Benkhelil, J., Mascle, J., Tricart, P., The Guinea continental margin: an example of a structurally complex transform margin (1995) Tectonophysics, 248, pp. 117-137; Dengler, M., Schott, F.A., Eden, C., Brandt, P., Fisher, J., Zantopp, R.J., Break-up of the Atlantic deep western boundary current into eddles at 8° S (2004) Nature, 432, pp. 1018-1020; Erbacher, J., Mosher, D.C., Malone, M.J., Proceedings of the Ocean Drilling Program (2004) Initial Reports, 207; Flower, B.P., Kennet, J., The Middle Miocene climatic transition: east Antarctic ice sheet development, deep ocean circulation and global carbon cycling (1994) Palaeogeogr.

However, few studies are designed to examine the insular connectivity in MDD. This study was performed to examine the insular connectivity in drug-naive MDD directly by using the insular cortices as seeds. Methods Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were obtained from 44 drug-naive MDD patients and 44 healthy controls at rest. The functional connectivity (FC) method was used to analyze the images. Results Significantly decreased FCs were found between the right insula and the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG, orbital part), left superior temporal gyrus (STG), right putamen, and right middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and between the left insula and the left superior temporal pole and right MOG in the patients compared with the controls. There were significantly negative correlations between the z values of the left insula-left superior temporal pole connectivity and the current episode duration (r=-0.332, p=0.028), between the z values of the right insula-left STG connectivity and the episode number (r=-0.343, p=0.023), and between the z values of the right insula-left MFG (orbital part) connectivity and the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire scores (r=-0.359, p=0.017) in the patients. Conclusions The findings reveal that depressed patients have decreased insular connectivity with the fronto-limbic circuit, hate circuit, and visual regions, and suggest that the insula may act as an integration center of emotional processing which is disrupted in the depressed patients. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A sample of 302 adolescents (53% boys; mean age 14.51 years) completed baseline measures of perceived ethnic discrimination, bicultural stress, and perceived negative context of reception; and outcome measures of depressive symptoms, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, aggressive behavior, and rule-breaking behavior six months post-baseline. A path analysis indicated that higher cultural stress scores predicted higher levels of all outcomes. These effects were consistent across genders, but varied by study site. Specifically, higher cultural stress scores increased depressive symptoms among participants in Miami, but not in Los Angeles. Findings suggest that cultural stress is a clinically relevant predictor of depressive symptoms and externalizing behaviors among Hispanic immigrant adolescents. © 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.","Conduct problems; Cultural stress; Depressive symptoms; Hispanic adolescents; Immigrants; Substance use","Achenbach, T.M., Rescorla, L., (2001) Manual for the ASEBA school-age forms and profiles: An integrated system of multi-informant assessment, , Department of Psychiatry, University of Vermont, Burlington; Agresti, A., (2007) An introduction to categorical data analysis, , Wiley, New York; Araújo, B.Y., Borrell, L.N., Understanding the link between discrimination, mental health outcomes, and life chances among Latinos (2006) Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences, 28, pp. 245-266; Bacallao, M.L., Smokowski, P.R., The costs of getting ahead: Mexican family system changes after immigration (2007) Family Relations, 56, pp. 52-66; Bernstein, R., (2013) U.S. Census Bureau projections show a slower growing, older, more diverse nation a half century from now, , https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/population/cb12-243.html, Retrieved November 1, 2013; Berry, J.W., Stress perspectives on acculturation (2003) The Cambridge handbook of acculturation psychology, pp. 43-57. , Cambridge University Press, New York, NY, D.L.

Bariatric surgery has been linked to a reduction of psychopathology other than to a reduction of weight and improvement in physical functioning. Aim of the present study was to compare psychological features of two groups of morbidly obese patients, before and after bariatric surgery, assessing social phobia and quality of life. Methods A total of 46 morbidly obese patients were enrolled in the study. Of them, 20 were waiting for bilio-pancreatic diversion (group A), while 26 had already undergone surgical procedure (group B). Psychometric evaluation assessed social phobia, fear for the body-shape and quality of life, using appropriate psychometric tests. Results The percentage of patients showing social phobia was significantly higher compared to a sample of healthy controls (p=0.004), both in group A (p=0.003) and in group B (p=0.029). No differences in percentage of patients affected by social phobia were found between groups. A significantly higher percentage of patients affected by distress about the body (p<0.0001) was found in group A with respect to group B. A reduction of quality of life was found in both groups. Conclusions The present study shows a high prevalence of social phobia in a population of morbidly obese patients, both before and after surgery. A general reduction of quality of life was also observed, with a partial improvement after surgery. Future studies are needed to clarify the relationship between social phobia and quality of life in surgically-treated morbidly obese patients. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we tested 72 male adolescents living in Northern Uganda (ages 14-19), 52 of whom still had both of their parents and 20 participants who had experienced parental loss. Participants completed a classic color-naming Stroop task as well as an affective interference task, the opposite emotions test (OET). Adolescents with parental loss showed a decrease in performance over time, especially on the Stroop task. Critically, this decrement in performance was positively associated with reported symptoms of trauma, but only in the parental loss group. The current data suggest a difficulty in maintaining cognitive control performance in youths with experience of parental loss. The findings are discussed in relation to traumatic stress and mental health in post-conflict regions. © 2015.","Affective Stroop; Early life stress; Executive function; Parental death; PTSD","Albertyn, R., Bickler, S.W., van As, A.B., Millar, A.J.W., Rode, H., The effects of war on children in Africa (2003) Pediatric Surgery International, 19, pp. 227-232; Alansari, B.M., Baroun, K., Gender and cultural performance differences on the Stroop Color and Word Test: a comparative study (2004) Social Behavior and Personality: An International Journal, 32 (3), pp. 233-243; Annan, J., Blattman, C., Horton, R., (2006) The state of youth and youth protection in Northern Uganda: Findings from the survey of war affected youth, , UNICEF, New York, USA; Atwine, B., Cantor-Graae, E., Bajunirwe, F., Psychological distress among AIDS orphans in rural Uganda (2005) Social Science & Medicine, 61, pp. 555-564; Bean, T., Derluyn, I., Eurelings-Bontekoe, E., Broekaert, E., Spinhoven, P., Validation of the multiple language version of the Hopkins symptom checklist-37 for refugee adolescents (2007) Adolescence, 42, pp. 51-71; Bean, T., Derluyn, I., Eurelings-Bontekoe, E., Broekaert, E., Spinhoven, P., Comparing psychological distress, traumatic stress reactions, and experiences of unaccompanied refugee minors with experiences of adolescents accompanied by parents (2007) Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease, 195 (4), pp. 288-297; Brownlow, J.A., Brown, T.S., Mellman, T.A., Relationships of posttraumatic stress symptoms and sleep measures to cognitive performance in young-adult African Americans (2014) Journal of Traumatic Stress, 27, pp. 217-223; Carrion, V.G., Garrett, A., Menon, V., Weems, C.F., Reiss, A.L., Posttraumatic stress symptoms and brain function during a response-inhibition task: an fMRI study in youth (2008) Depression & Anxiety, 25, pp. 514-526; Casey, B.J., Tottenham, N., Liston, C., Durston, S., Imaging the developing brain: what have we learned about cognitive development?

Moreover, there is a high risk of relapse and developing a chronic illness. Randomized-controlled trails (RCT), the gold-standard for evaluating treatments, show treatments to be efficacious, yet little is known about their generalizability and long-term durability in ""usual-care"" settings. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of evidence-based pediatric OCD-treatments in regular practice. Participants were 109 children (aged 7-17 years) with a primary diagnosis of OCD, recruited from a specialized OCD-clinic in Sweden. Few exclusion criteria were applied. The youths were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months following the first assessment, using Childre's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and Children's OCD Impact Scale. They were treated with Cognitive Behavior Therapy, augmented with SSRI when indicated. The majority responded well to treatment i.e. were free from OCD or in remission at 12 month evaluation. Moreover, the participants psychosocial functioning significantly improved from baseline to evaluation at 6 and 12 months. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Childhood adolescence; Naturalistic study; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Outcome; Treatment","Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (2012) Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 51 (1), pp. 98-113; Abramowitz, J.S., Whiteside, S.P., Deacon, B.J., The effectiveness of treatment for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder: a meta-analysis (2005) Behavior Therapy, 36 (1), pp. 55-63; Achenbach, T., (1991) Manual for the child behavior checklist/4-18 and 1991 profile, , University of Vermont, Department of Psychiatry, Burlington, VT; (1994) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV), 4. , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC; Busner, J., Targum, S.D., The clinical global impressions scale: applying a research tool in clinical practice (2007) Psychiatry (Edgmont), 4 (7), pp. 28-37; Ehlers, S., Gillberg, C., Wing, L., A screening questionnaire for Asperger syndrome and other high-functioning autism spectrum disorders in school age children (1999) Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 29 (2), pp. 129-141; Fitzmaurice, G.M., Laird, N.M., Ware, J.H., (2011) Applied longitudinal analysis, , Wiley, Hoboken, NJ; Gallant, J., Storch, E.A., Merlo, L.J., Ricketts, E.D., Geffken, G.R., Goodman, W.K., Murphy, T.K., Convergent and discriminant validity of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-Symptom Checklist (2008) Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 22 (8), pp. 1369-1376; Geller, D.A., Biederman, J., Griffin, S., Jones, J., Lefkowitz, T.R., Comorbidity of juvenile obsessive-compulsive disorder with disruptive behavior disorders (1996) Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 35 (12), pp. 1637-1646; Geller, D.A., Biederman, J., Stewart, S.E., Mullin, B., Martin, A., Spencer, T., Faraone, S.V., Which SSRI?

Although during most of the Holocene the climatic conditions were warm and humid, previously, a vast plain dominated by deflation processes and enhanced by weathering processes was developed in an arid environment. Fluvial deposits produced afterwards are continuous and lithologically homogeneous, which allows differentiation and characterization of the entire stratigraphic sequence. The stratigraphic units of this area, closely related to the paleoclimatic conditions, are recognized and characterized. Three lithostratigraphic units of fluvial origin (Members) and two paleosols have been differentiated. The first ones were grouped in the Luján Formation. Some of the units are related to other ones previously recognized in this area (La Chumbiada Member and La Pelada Geosol), but others have no similarity or relationship with previously known units (Gorch and Puente Las Gaviotas Members, and Frigorífico Belgrano Geosol). Radiocarbon ages suggest that the fluvial sequences were deposited after the glacial maximum, corresponding to MIS 1, except for the basal levels of the lower member which is late Late Pleistocene. Although the general paleoclimatic conditions were related to warm and humid climate, events related to water deficits were also recognized, which could be related to the Younger Dryas, the middle Holocene and the late Holocene. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","MIS 1; Quaternary; Radiocarbon dating; Salado river","Ameghino, F., Excursiones geológicas y paleontológicas en la provincia de Buenos Aires (1884) Boletín Acad.

Zablocki VA Medical CenterMilwaukee, WI, United States","The preBötzinger (preBötC) complex has been suggested as the primary site where systemically administered selective serotonin agonists have been shown to reduce or prevent opioid-induced depression of breathing. However, this hypothesis has not been tested pharmacologically in vivo. This study sought to determine whether 5-HT<inf>1A</inf> receptors within the preBötC and ventral respiratory column (VRC) mediate the tachypneic response induced by intravenous (IV) (±)-8-Hydroxy-2-diproplyaminotetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) in a decerebrated dog model. IV 8-OH-DPAT (19±2μg/kg) reduced both inspiratory (I) and expiratory (E) durations by ~40%, but had no effect on peak phrenic activity (PPA). Picoejection of 1, 10, and 100μM 8-OH-DPAT on I and E preBötC neurons produced dose-dependent decreases up to ~40% in peak discharge. Surprisingly, microinjections of 8-OH-DPAT and 5-HT within the VRC from the obex to 9mm rostral had no effect on timing and PPA. These results suggest that the tachypneic effects of IV 8-OH-DPAT are due to receptors located outside of the areas we studied. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","5-HT receptors; 5-HT<inf>1A</inf> receptors; 8-OH-DPAT; Control of breathing; PreBötzinger complex; Respiratory neurons","Bacon, W.L., Beck, S.G., 5-Hydroxytryptamine(7) receptor activation decreases slow afterhyperpolarization amplitude in CA3 hippocampal pyramidal cells (2000) J.

Despite the fact that a growing proportion of cardiac surgery patients are octogenarians, cardioplegic regimes remain comparable across patients of all ages. We compared the hemodynamic performance, metabolic parameters and ultrastructural changes in adult and senescent rat hearts after application of Buckberg's blood cardioplegia (BCP) to evaluate differences between the age groups regarding postischemic myocardial function and cellular ultrastructure. Methods: Hearts of adult (young adult group, 3-4. months) and senescent (old group, 24. months) male Wistar rats were excised and inserted into a blood perfused isolated heart apparatus (Langendorff perfusion). After a stabilization period of 30. min, in 16 adult and 16 senescent hearts, Buckberg BCP was administered antegradely and repeated every 20. min. Six young adult and 3 senescent hearts served as ischemia control. After an aortic clamping time of 90. min an antegrade hot shot was administered. During reperfusion ex vivo cardiac functional parameters were recorded, including coronary blood flow, left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and velocity of myocardial contraction or relaxation (+/-. dp/dt). Oxygen consumption and lactate production of the hearts were calculated. After perfusion fixation, the hearts of five rats in each BCP group and 3 rats in each ischemia group were investigated for cellular edema and mitochondrial damage by morphometry using transmission electron microscopy. Results: While recovery of cardiac function after 90. min of unprotected ischemia was significantly impaired in senescent hearts, functional recovery after ischemia protected by BCP was similar in adult and senescent hearts. Mitochondrial ultrastructure was severely damaged in both age groups after 90. min ischemia, but well preserved in both BCP groups. The qualitative analysis was confirmed by the morphometric cellular edema index and the volume-to-surface ratio of the mitochondria. Myocardial oxygen consumption was highest and lactate production was lowest in senescent hearts. Conclusion: Senescent rat hearts were more susceptible to unprotected ischemia/reperfusion injury than young adult hearts. When protected by BCP, we found no difference in hemodynamic performance between adult and senescent hearts indicating preserved myocardial protection even in senescent individuals. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Aging; Cardiac surgery; Cardioplegia; Ischemia/reperfusion","Böning, A., Lutter, G., Mrowczynski, W., Attmann, T., Bödeker, R.H., Scheibelhut, C., Cremer, J., Octogenarians undergoing combined aortic valve replacement and myocardial revascularisation: perioperative mortality and medium-term survival (2010) Thorac.

This study was conducted to examine the utility of two measures of narcissism - the Narcissistic Pathological Inventory and the Pathological Narcissism Inventory, in jointly assessing a broader range of narcissism content. The sample consisted of 220 undergraduate students. Eight factors were extracted from an exploratory analysis labeled: Contingent Self-Esteem, Grandiose Fantasy, Leadership/Authority, Devaluing the Self, Grandiose Exhibitionism, Manipulative, Entitlement, and Superiority. It was found that these narcissism factors had differing relationships with self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and stress. Although a higher-order factor structure did not have satisfactory fit, it is maintained that these eight factors reflect the two higher order dimensions of adaptive and maladaptive narcissism. It is recommended that future researchers construct their studies based on a multidimensional conceptualisation of narcissism, and use multiple narcissism measures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Factor analysis; Narcissism; Self-esteem","Ackerman, R.A., Witt, E.A., Donnellan, M.B., Trzesniewski, K.H., Robins, R.W., Kashy, D.A., What does the Narcissistic Personality Inventory really measure?

This exploratory study examines differences in lithium response and treatment outcomes in Hispanics, African Americans, and non-Hispanic whites with bipolar disorder in the Lithium Treatment Moderate Dose Use Study (LiTMUS). Methods LiTMUS was a six-site randomized controlled trial of low-dose lithium added to optimized treatment (OPT; personalized, evidence-based pharmacotherapy) vs. OPT alone in outpatients with bipolar disorder. Of 283 participants, 47 African Americans, 39 Hispanics, and 175 non-Hispanic whites were examined. We predicted minority groups would have more negative medication attitudes and higher attrition rates, but better clinical outcomes. Results African Americans in the lithium group improved more on depression and life functioning compared to whites over the 6 month study. African Americans in the OPT only group had marginal improvement on depression symptoms. For Hispanics, satisfaction with life did not significantly improve in the OPT only group, in contrast to whites and African Americans who improved over time on all measures. Attitudes toward medications did not differ across ethnic/racial groups. Conclusions African Americans show some greater improvements with lithium than non-Hispanic whites, and Hispanics showed more consistent improvements in the lithium group. The impact of low-dose lithium should be studied in a larger sample as there may be particular benefit for African Americans and Hispanics. Given that the control group (regardless of ethnicity/race) had significant improvements, optimized treatment may be beneficial for any ethnic group. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

They have been used in the treatment of serious mental and emotional symptoms including bipolar disorder, organic psychoses, psychotic depression and schizophrenia. However, these drugs cause serious side effects such as akathisia, hyperprolactinaemia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. In this work we investigated the molecular recognition of two typical phenothiazine compounds, phenosafranin and safranin O by the most pivotal heme protein hemoglobin using steady state and time-resolved fluorescence, extrinsic 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) fluorescent probe, circular dichroism (CD) along with computational modeling. Results show phenothiazines complex with protein via formation of adducts at 298 K with moderate strengths of 3.555 × 104 M-1 and 2.567 × 104 M-1 for the hemoglobin-phenosafranin and hemoglobin-safranin O, respectively. We also found phenothiazines were effectors at the protein allosteric site, which affects the allosteric equilibrium. Further, time-resolved fluorescence and hydrophobic ANS experiments showed the static mechanism is dominated for the shrinkage in the fluorescence intensity of β-37 Trp residue at the α<inf>1</inf>β<inf>2</inf> interface. The stoichiometric proportion of the protein-drug adduct is 1:1, as derived from Job's plot. Several crucial noncovalent bonds, including hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking and hydrophobic interactions played a major role in stabilizing the noncovalent conjugates. Based on three-dimensional fluorescence, we concluded that the conformation of hemoglobin is partially destabilized after recognition with phenothiazines. These alterations were confirmed by far-UV CD spectra that showed the α-helix of protein decreased from 78.3% in free hemoglobin to 62.8% and 64.8% in hemoglobin-phenosafranin and hemoglobin-safranin O, respectively. Computer-aided molecular docking was consistent, indicating that both phenothiazines are situated within the pocket composed of α<inf>1</inf> and β<inf>2</inf> subunits. Affinity of hemoglobin to phenosafranin is superior compared with safranin O. This difference may be explained by the methyl group substituent on A- and C-rings, and by the different molecular volume between phenosafranin and safranin O. Our data provides further explanation of the overall pharmacokinetics of phenothiazines and sheds light on the allosteric regulation of heme proteins. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The model was developed to provide radionuclide source terms for use in performance assessment calculations for various types of geologic repositories. It is based on mixed potential theory and consists of a two-phase fuel surface made up of UO<inf>2</inf> and a noble metal bearing fission product phase in contact with groundwater. The corrosion potential at the surface of the dissolving fuel is calculated by balancing cathodic and anodic reactions occurring at the solution interfaces with UO<inf>2</inf> and NMP surfaces. Dissolved oxygen and hydrogen peroxide generated by radiolysis of the groundwater are the major oxidizing agents that promote fuel dissolution. Several reactions occurring on noble metal alloy surfaces are electrically coupled to the UO<inf>2</inf> and can catalyze or inhibit oxidative dissolution of the fuel. The most important of these is the oxidation of hydrogen, which counteracts the effects of oxidants (primarily H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> and O<inf>2</inf>). Inclusion of this reaction greatly decreases the oxidation of U(IV) and slows fuel dissolution significantly. In addition to radiolytic hydrogen, large quantities of hydrogen can be produced by the anoxic corrosion of steel structures within and near the fuel waste package. The model accurately predicts key experimental trends seen in literature data, the most important being the dramatic depression of the fuel dissolution rate by the presence of dissolved hydrogen at even relatively low concentrations (e.g.; less than 1 mM). This hydrogen effect counteracts oxidation reactions and can limit fuel degradation to chemical dissolution, which results in radionuclide source term values that are four or five orders of magnitude lower than when oxidative dissolution processes are operative. This paper presents the scientific basis of the model, the approach for modeling used fuel in a disposal system, and preliminary calculations to demonstrate the application and value of the model. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, rising atmospheric CO2 concentration may counteract the negative effects of salinity stress. The objective of this study was to determine whether elevated CO2 mitigates salinity stress by influencing physiological activities and/or ion (Na+ and K+) balance in Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon cv. 'Tifway'). Plants were exposed to either ambient CO2 concentration (400μmolmol-1) or elevated CO2 concentration (800μmolmol-1) and maintained well-watered (control) with fresh water or subjected to salinity stress by irrigating plants with NaCl solution (200mM). Salinity stress caused reduction in turf quality (TQ), leaf relative water content (RWC), leaf net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, and cellular membrane stability. Elevated CO2 concentration alleviated the depression of those physiological parameters and promoted osmotic adjustment through accumulation of soluble sugars, proline, and glycine betaine (GB) under salinity stress, but had no significant effects on the ratio of Na+ to K+. Our results demonstrated that elevated CO2 concentration was effective in alleviating physiological damages of salinity stress in Bermudagrass, suggesting that C4 grasses may benefit from the rising atmospheric CO2 concentration associated with global climate changes. The positive physiological effects of elevated CO2, as manifested by improved TQ, RWC, Pn and cell membrane stability could be related to the maintenance of cellular hydration associated with osmotic adjustment due to the accumulation of soluble sugars, proline and GB, and the suppression of Na+ accumulation independent of changes in K+ accumulation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Carbohydrate; Cynodon dactylon; Glycine betaine; Osmotic adjustment","Ahire, M.L., Walunj, P.R., Kishor, P.B.K., Nikam, T.D., Effect of sodium chloride-induced stress on growth proline, glycine betaine accumulation, antioxidative defence and bacoside A content in in vitro regenerated shoots of Bacopa monnieri (L.)

The genus Trematomus (suborder Notothenioidei) is regarded primarily as a high latitude group because of its abundance there, they also inhabit the warmer regions in smaller numbers. Freeze avoidance in the notothenioids is linked to the presence of two antifreeze proteins (AFPs); the antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) and antifreeze potentiating protein (AFPP), both of which adsorb to internal ice crystals inhibiting growth. Both high and low latitude trematomids possess sufficient AFP to lower their blood freezing point below that of seawater (- 1.9. °C). We investigated the contributions of AFGPs and AFPP to the blood freezing point depression to determine how they varied with depth, water temperature, and the presence of ice. High latitude trematomids had lower blood freezing points than those inhabiting lower latitude waters indicating differences in their freeze avoidance capacities. Lower freezing points were associated with higher levels of antifreeze activity due to higher levels of both AFGP and AFPP. Populations of Trematomus hansoni and Trematomus bernacchii from shallow depths appear more freeze avoidant than populations inhabiting deep, ice-free water based on their lower freezing points and higher antifreeze activities. Gel electrophoresis of the trichloroacetic acid-soluble AFGPs indicates that only high molecular weight isoforms, which contribute more to AFGP activity, vary across species as well as between individuals of a species. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..","Antifreeze glycoprotein; Ecological physiology; Thermal hysteresis","Bilyk, K.T., DeVries, A.L., Freezing avoidance of the Antarctic icefishes (Channichthyidae) across thermal gradients in the Southern Ocean (2010) Polar Biol., 33, pp. 203-213; Cziko, P.A., Evans, C.W., Cheng, C.H.C., DeVries, A.L., Freezing resistance of antifreeze-deficient larval Antarctic fish (2006) J.

This is particularly important for communities that are likely to be repeatedly flooded where levels of mental health disorder will damage long term resilience to future flooding.There are a variety of factors that affect the prevalence of mental health disorders in the aftermath of flooding including pre-existing mental health, socio-economic factors and flood severity. However previous research has tended to focus on the short term impacts immediately following the flood event and much less focus has been given to the longer terms effects of flooding. Understanding of factors affecting the longer term mental health outcomes for flooded households is critical in order to support communities in improving social resilience. Hence, the aim of this study was to explore the characteristics associated with psychological distress and mental health deterioration over the longer term.The research examined responses from a postal survey of households flooded during the 2007 flood event across England. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and binomial logistic regression were applied to data representing household characteristics, flood event characteristics and post-flood stressors and coping strategies. These factors were related to reported measures of stress, anxiety, depression and mental health deterioration. The results showed that household income, depth of flooding; having to move out during reinstatement and mitigating actions are related to the prevalence of psycho-social symptoms in previously flooded households. In particular relocation and household income were the most predictive factors. The practical implication of these findings for recovery after flooding are: to consider the preferences of households in terms of the need to move out during restorative building works and the financial resource constraints that may lead to severe mental hardship. In addition the findings suggest that support with installing mitigation measures may lead to improved mental health outcomes for communities at risk. © 2015 The Authors.","Anxiety; Flood impact; Flood memory; Flood recovery; Frequent flooding; Mental health; PTSD","Alderman, K., Turner, L.R., Tong, S., Floods and human health: a systematic review (2012) Environ.

Extensive speech sound discrimination training alters A1 responses. While the neighboring auditory cortical fields each contain information about speech sound identity, each field processes speech sounds differently. We hypothesized that while all fields would exhibit training-induced plasticity following speech training, there would be unique differences in how each field changes. In this study, rats were trained to discriminate speech sounds by consonant or vowel in quiet and in varying levels of background speech-shaped noise. Local field potential and multiunit responses were recorded from four auditory cortex fields in rats that had received 10 weeks of speech discrimination training. Our results reveal that training alters speech evoked responses in each of the auditory fields tested. The neural response to consonants was significantly stronger in anterior auditory field (AAF) and A1 following speech training. The neural response to vowels following speech training was significantly weaker in ventral auditory field (VAF) and posterior auditory field (PAF). This differential plasticity of consonant and vowel sound responses may result from the greater paired pulse depression, expanded low frequency tuning, reduced frequency selectivity, and lower tone thresholds, which occurred across the four auditory fields. These findings suggest that alterations in the distributed processing of behaviorally relevant sounds may contribute to robust speech discrimination. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Auditory processing; Map reorganization; Receptive field plasticity; Speech therapy","Engineer, C.T., Perez, C.A., Chen, Y.H., Carraway, R.S., Reed, A.C., Shetake, J.A., Cortical activity patterns predict speech discrimination ability (2008) Nat Neurosci, 11, pp. 603-608; Mesgarani, N., David, S.V., Fritz, J.B., Shamma, S.A., Phoneme representation and classification in primary auditory cortex (2008) J Acoust Soc Am, 123, p. 899; Perez, C.A., Engineer, C.T., Jakkamsetti, V., Carraway, R.S., Perry, M.S., Kilgard, M.P., Different timescales for the neural coding of consonant and vowel sounds (2013) Cereb Cortex, 23, pp. 670-683; Engineer, C.T., Perez, C.A., Carraway, R.S., Chang, K.Q., Roland, J.L., Kilgard, M.P., Speech training alters tone frequency tuning in rat primary auditory cortex (2014) Behav Brain Res, 258, pp. 166-178; Callan, D.E., Tajima, K., Callan, A.M., Kubo, R., Masaki, S., Akahane-Yamada, R., Learning-induced neural plasticity associated with improved identification performance after training of a difficult second-language phonetic contrast (2003) Neuroimage, 19, pp. 113-124; Ahveninen, J., Huang, S., Nummenmaa, A., Belliveau, J.W., Hung, A.-Y., Jääskeläinen, I.P., Evidence for distinct human auditory cortex regions for sound location versus identity processing (2013) Nat Commun, 4, p. 2585; Lomber, S.G., Malhotra, S., Double dissociation of what and where processing in auditory cortex (2008) Nat Neurosci, 11, pp. 609-616; Centanni, T.M., Engineer, C.T., Kilgard, M.P., Cortical speech-evoked response patterns in multiple auditory fields are correlated with behavioral discrimination ability (2013) J Neurophysiol, 110, pp. 177-189; Ranasinghe, K.G., Vrana, W.A., Matney, C.J., Kilgard, M.P., Increasing diversity of neural responses to speech sounds across the central auditory pathway (2013) Neuroscience, 252, pp. 80-97; Chechik, G., Anderson, M.J., Bar-Yosef, O., Young, E.D., Tishby, N., Nelken, I., Reduction of information redundancy in the ascending auditory pathway (2006) Neuron, 51, pp. 359-368; Gentner, T.Q., Margoliash, D., Neuronal populations and single cells representing learned auditory objects (2003) Nature, 424, pp. 669-674; Thompson, J.V., Gentner, T.Q., Song recognition learning and stimulus-specific weakening of neural responses in the avian auditory forebrain (2010) J Neurophysiol, 103, pp. 1785-1797; Engineer, C.T., Centanni, T.M., Im, K.W., Kilgard, M.P., Speech sound discrimination training improves auditory cortex responses in a rat model of autism (2014) Front Syst Neurosci, 8, p. 137; Kawahara, H., Speech representation and transformation using adaptive interpolation of weighted spectrum: vocoder revisited (1997) Proc.

Parker Agricultural Research Center, University of ArizonaTucson, AZ, United States","The objective of this study was to evaluate in cattle, the effects of acute exposure to a heat stress (HS) environment on the status of the pituitary (thyrotropin, TSH)-thyroid (thyroxine, T4)-peripheral tissue T4 deiodination (type 1 5'-deiodinase [D1]; triiodothyronine [T3]; reverse-triiodothyronine [rT3]) axis, and the further response of this pituitary-thyroid-peripheral tissue axis (PTTA) to perturbation caused by the induction of the proinflammatory innate immune state provoked by the administration of gram-negative bacteria endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]). Ten steers (318 ± 49kg body weight) housed in controlled environment chambers were subjected to either a thermoneutral (TN: constant 19°C) or HS temperature conditions (cyclical daily temperatures: 32.2°C-40.0°C) for a total period of 9d. To minimize the effects of altered plane of nutrition due to HS, steers in TN were pair-fed to animals in HS conditions. Steers received 2 LPS challenges 3d apart (LPS1 and LPS2; 0.2μg/kg body weight, intravenously, Escherichia coli 055:B5) with the first challenge administered on day 4 relative to the start of the environmental conditioning. Jugular blood samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 24h relative to the start of each LPS challenge. Plasma TSH, T4, T3, and rT3 were measured by radioimmunoassay. Liver D1 activity was measured in biopsy samples collected before the LPS1 (0h) and 24h after LPS2. Before the start of LPS1, HS decreased (P &lt; 0.01 vs TN) plasma TSH (40%), T4 (45.4%), and T3 (25.9%), but did not affect rT3 concentrations. In TN steers, the LPS1 challenge decreased (P &lt; 0.01 vs 0h) plasma concentrations of TSH between 1 and 7h and T4 and T3 at 7 and 24h. In HS steers, plasma TSH concentrations were decreased at 2h only (P &lt; 0.05), whereas plasma T3 was decreased at 7 and 24h (P &lt; 0.01). Whereas plasma T4 concentrations were already depressed in HS steers at 0h, LPS1 did not further affect the levels. Plasma rT3 concentrations were increased in all steers at 4, 7, and 24h after LPS1 (P &lt; 0.01). The patterns of concentration change of T4, T3, and rT3 during LPS2 mirrored those observed in LPS1; the responses in plasma TSH were of smaller magnitude than those incurred after LPS1. The LPS challenges reduced (P &lt; 0.01) hepatic activity of D1 in all animals but no differences were observed between steers subjected to TN or HS environment. The data are consistent with the concept that acute exposure of cattle to a HS environment results in the depression of the pituitary and thyroid components of the PTTA, whereas a normal capacity to generate T3 from T4 in the liver is preserved. The data also suggest that LPS challenge further suppresses all components of the PTTA including liver T3 generation, and these PTTA perturbations are more pronounced in steers that encounter a HS exposure. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Cattle; Deiodinase; Endotoxin; Heat stress; Thyroid hormone; Thyrotropin","Silva, J.E., Thermogenic mechanisms and their hormonal regulation (2006) Physiol Rev, 86, pp. 435-464; Dayton, W.R., Hathway, M.R., Control of animal growth by glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, autocrine,and/or paracrine growth factors (1991) Growth regulation in farm animals, pp. 17-45. , Elsevier Science Publishing Co, Inc, New York, A.M.

Our hypothesis is that uric acid plasma levels may be higher in unipolar depressive patients with adult ADHD than without ADHD. Methods Sixty four patients diagnosed with MDD were investigated, among which 28 patients had been diagnosed with ADHD according to DSM5. 28 patients were ADHD. 36 patients were diagnosed as not having ADHD. One of the criteria was including cases that had not started using medication for the current depressive episode. The control group (HC) consisted of 43 healthy staff members from our hospital who had no prior psychiatric admission or treatment history and matched with the patient group in terms of age and gender. Blood samples were obtained, and plasma uric acid levels were recorded in mg/dl after being rotated for 15 min in a centrifuge with 3000 rotations and kept at -80 °C. Results Uric acid plasma levels 5.1±1.6 in unipolar depression and ADHD group, 4.6±1.8 in unipolar depression group. Uric acid plasma levels were higher in the comorbid unipolar depression and ADHD group than in the unipolar depression and healthy control (HC) groups (F= 4.367, p= 0.037). There was no correlation between ADHD (predominantly inattentive type) and uric acid plasma levels (p>0.05). Limitations The limitation of this study is the small number of sample and one of the criteria was including cases that had not started using medication for the current depressive episode. Conclusion The identification of a different etiologic process of biological markers may lead to a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms involved in drive and impulsivity and may suggest different potential targets for therapeutic intervention. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); Impulsivity; Unipolar depression; Uric acid","Barrera, C.M., Ruiz, Z.R., Dunlap, W.P., Uric acid: A participating factor in the symptoms of hyperactivity (1988) Biol.

However, recent evidence suggests that the glutamatergic system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of these disorders. This study pharmacologically characterized a structurally novel metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu<inf>5</inf>) receptor negative allosteric modulator, DSR-98776, and evaluated its effect on rodent models of depression and mania. First, DSR-98776 in vitro profile was assessed using intracellular calcium and radioligand binding assays. This compound showed dose-dependent inhibitory activity for mGlu<inf>5</inf> receptors by binding to the same allosteric site as 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), a known mGlu<inf>5</inf> inhibitor. The in vivo therapeutic benefits of DSR-98776 were evaluated in common rodent models of depression and mania. In the rat forced swimming test, DSR-98776 (1-3 mg/kg) significantly reduced rats immobility time after treatment for 7 consecutive days, while paroxetine (3 and 10 mg/kg) required administration for 2 consecutive weeks to reduce rats immobility time. In the mouse forced swimming test, acute administration of DSR-98776 (10-30 mg/kg) significantly reduced immobility time. This effect was not influenced by 4-chloro-DL-phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride-induced 5-HT depletion. Finally, DSR-98776 (30 mg/kg) significantly decreased methamphetamine/chlordiazepoxide-induced hyperactivity in mice, which reflects this compound antimanic-like effect. These results indicate that DSR-98776 acts as an orally potent antidepressant and antimanic in rodent models and can be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of a broad range of mood disorders with depressive and manic states. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here we describe a dual method employing fluorescent thermal shift assay (FTSA), also known as differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), to interrogate ligands of the kinase p38α as well as several known pan-assay interference compounds (PAINs) such as aggregators, redox cyclers, and fluorescence quenchers. This combinatorial approach allows for independent verification of several biophysical parameters such as K<inf>D</inf>, k<inf>on</inf>, k<inf>off</inf>, ΔG, ΔS, and ΔH, which may further guide chemical development of a ligand series. Affinity values obtained from FTSA curves allow for insight into compound binding compared with reporting shifts in melting temperature. Ligand-p38 interaction data were in good agreement with previous literature. Aggregators and fluorescence quenchers appeared to reduce fluorescence signal in the FTSAs, causing artificially high shifts in T<inf>m</inf> values, whereas redox compounds caused either shifts in affinity that did not agree between FTSA and SPR or a depression of FTSA signal. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This analyzer has an aperture plate to sample electron beams and a cylindrical electrode to overcome the defocusing effects. The front end of the analyzer constructed as a multistage depression collector (MDC) structure is intended to shape the field to prevent electrons from being accelerated to escape. The direct-current (DC) beams of the K-band space TWTs with the removing MDC can be investigated on the beam measurement system. The current density distribution of DC beams is determined by the analyzer, while the anode voltage and helix voltage of the TWTs are 7000 V and 6850 V, respectively. The current curve's slope effect due to the reflection of secondary electrons on the copper collector of the analyzer is discussed. The experimental analysis shows this RFEA has a good energy resolution to satisfy the requirement of beam measurement. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of the drug on the maximum rate (V<inf>max</inf>) of enzymatic activities related to hippocampal synaptic energy utilization were evaluated, in the perspective of its employment for Dementias and Depression Therapy. Two types of synaptic plasma membranes (SPM1 and SPM2) were isolated from the hippocampus of rats treated with l-acetylcarnitine (30 and 60 mg/kg i.p., 28 days, 5 days/week). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE); Na+, K+, Mg2+-ATP-ase; ouabain-insensitive Mg2+-ATP-ase; Na+, K+-ATP-ase; Ca2+, Mg2+-ATP-ase activities were evaluated. In control animals, enzymatic activities were differently expressed in SPM1, being the evaluated enzymatic activities higher in SPM2. Subchronic treatment with l-acetylcarnitine (i) did not modify AChE on both SPMs; (ii) increased Na+, K+, Mg2+-ATP-ase, ouabain-insensitive Mg2+-ATP-ase and Na+, K+-ATP-ase at the dose of 30 and 60 mg/kg on SPM1 and SPM2; (iii) increased Ca2+, Mg2+-ATP-ase activity on both SPMs at the dose of 60 mg/kg. These results have been discussed considering the pathophysiology and treatment of Dementias and Depression because, although referred to normal healthy animals, they support the notion that l-acetylcarnitine may have positive effects in these pathologies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies showed that DSS had its therapeutic efficacy on depression. In the present study, the effects of aqueous extract of DSS were examined to investigate the pharmacological basis for its therapeutic efficacy on chronic restraint stress (CRS)-induced sleep disorder. Mice were treated with DSS by gavage administration at doses of 0.625. g/kg, 1.25. g/kg and 2.5. g/kg for 10 days. Sleep time and sleep latency were measured 24. h after the CRS procedures using the sodium pentobarbital-induced sleep test. Open field test was used to evaluate the mice locomotion and anxiety/depression levels. Body weight and food intake were determined as well. The results showed that DSS dose-dependently prolonged latency and decreased sleep time of CRS mice, reversed CRS-induced decrease of mean velocity, the percentage of center distance and time in central area, as well as decreased body weight and food intake. In conclusion, our results suggest that DSS has exerted measurable therapeutic effects in hypersomnia induced by chronic restraint stress. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Chronic restraint stress; Danggui-Shaoyao-San; Depression; Drowsiness; Open field test","Arai, K., Ohata, H., Shibasaki, T., Non-peptidic corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor type 1 antagonist reverses restraint stress-induced shortening of sodium pentobarbital-induced sleeping time of rats: evidence that an increase in arousal induced by stress is mediated through CRH receptor type 1 (1998) Neurosci.

Both serotonin-2A (5-HT<inf>2A</inf>) and -2C (5-HT<inf>2C</inf>) receptors are known to be important in neuropsychiatric drug action and are distributed throughout the mPFC. However, their interactive role in serotonergic cortical regulation is poorly understood. While the main signal transduction mechanism for both receptors is stimulation of phosphoinositide production, they can have opposite effects downstream. 5-HT<inf>2A</inf> versus 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> receptor activation oppositely regulates behavior and can oppositely affect neurochemical release within the mPFC. These distinct receptor effects could be caused by their differential cellular distribution within the cortex and/or other areas. It is known that both receptors are located on GABAergic and pyramidal cells within the mPFC, but it is not clear whether they are expressed on the same or different cells. The present work employed immunofluorescence with confocal microscopy to examine this in layers V-VI of the prelimbic mPFC. The majority of GABA cells in the deep prelimbic mPFC expressed 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> receptor immunoreactivity. Furthermore, most cells expressing 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> receptor immunoreactivity notably co-expressed 5-HT<inf>2A</inf> receptors. However, 27% of 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> receptor immunoreactive cells were not GABAergic, indicating that a population of prelimbic pyramidal projection cells could express the 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> receptor. Indeed, some cells with 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> and 5-HT<inf>2A</inf> receptor co-labeling had a pyramidal shape and were expressed in the typical layered fashion of pyramidal cells. This indirectly demonstrates that 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> and 5-HT<inf>2A</inf> receptors may be commonly co-expressed on GABAergic cells within the deep layers of the prelimbic mPFC and perhaps co-localized on a small population of local pyramidal projection cells. Thus a complex interplay of cortical 5-HT<inf>2A</inf> and 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> receptor mechanisms exists, which if altered, could modulate efferent brain systems implicated in mental illness. © 2015 IBRO.","5-HT;

We use geomorphic signatures at varied spatial scales interpreted from SRTM-DEM/Landsat-ETM data, supplemented with field observations to review the tectonic evolution of Kashmir basin in northwest Himalayas. Geomorphic evidence is persuasive of a credible NNW-SSE trending dextral strike-slip structure (central Kashmir Fault - CKF), with the strike length of ~. 165. km, stretched centrally over the NNW-SSE length of the Kashmir basin. As a result of the strike-slip motion and subsequent erosion, significant deformation has taken place along the CKF. In addition, broad geomorphic architecture of the basin reveals typical pull-apart characteristics. Hence, we deduce that the Kashmir basin has evolved as a pull-apart Quaternary sediment depression owing to the deformation along the central Kashmir Fault. The spatial distribution pattern of seismic events (NEIC-catalogue, 1973-2013) and GPS measurements (published), collectively substantiate our geomorphic interpretations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Basin; Evolution; Kashmir; Strike-slip; Tectonics","Ader, T., Avouac, J.-P., Liu-Zeng, J., Lyon-Caen, H., Bollinger, L., Galetzka, J., Genrich, J., Flouzat, M., Convergence rate across the Nepal Himalaya and interseismic coupling on the Main Himalayan Thrust: implications for seismic hazard (2012) J.

We previously reported that glucose and glycogen concentrations in brain structures important for depression are higher in a prenatal stress model of depression when compared with control animals. A marked rise in the concentrations of these carbohydrates and glucose transporters were evident in prenatally stressed animals subjected to acute stress and glucose loading in adulthood. To determine whether elevated levels of brain glucose are associated with a change in its metabolism in this model, we assessed key glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase), products of glycolysis, i.e., pyruvate and lactate, and two selected enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Additionally, we assessed glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Prenatal stress increased the levels of phosphofructokinase, an important glycolytic enzyme, in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. However, prenatal stress had no effect on hexokinase or pyruvate kinase levels. The lactate concentration was elevated in prenatally stressed rats in the frontal cortex, and pyruvate levels remained unchanged. Among the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, prenatal stress decreased the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase in the hippocampus, but it had no effect on α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Like in the case of glucose and its transporters, also in the present study, differences in markers of glucose metabolism between control animals and those subjected to prenatal stress were not observed under basal conditions but in rats subjected to acute stress and glucose load in adulthood. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was not reduced by prenatal stress but was found to be even higher in animals exposed to all experimental conditions, i.e., prenatal stress, acute stress, and glucose administration. Our data indicate that glycolysis is increased and the Krebs cycle is decreased in the brain of a prenatal stress animal model of depression. © 2015 IBRO.","Brain glucose metabolism; Depression; Lactate;

Rapidly distributing to forebrain regions to increase synaptic concentrations of three monoamines (dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA)), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is important in METH-altered behavioral and psychological profiles. Activation of the ventral mPFC can modify physiological variables, however, METH-evoked autonomic changes from this region are unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the respiratory, metabolic and cardiovascular effects of microinjection of METH, DA, 5-HT and NA into the ventral mPFC in urethane-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. METH and NA microinjection evoked dose-related increases in heart rate, interscapular brown adipose tissue temperature and expired CO<inf>2</inf>, a pattern of response characteristic of non-shivering thermogenesis. NA and 5-HT microinjection elicited pressor and depressor responses, respectively, with matching baroreflex adjustments in sympathetic nerve activity while METH and DA evoked no change in vasomotor outflow. Low doses of METH and DA may evoke respiratory depression. These data suggest that METH's actions in the ventral mPFC, likely via adrenergic receptors, evoke non-shivering thermogenesis which may contribute to the increased body temperature and tachycardia seen in those that abuse METH. © 2015 IBRO.","Cardiovascular;

A greenhouse experiment was carried out, to determine yield, growth, fruit quality, SPAD index, electrolyte leakage, and mineral composition of zucchini squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) inoculated (+AM) and noninoculated (-AM) with arbuscular mycorrhizal and cultured in pots filled with quartziferous sand. Plants were supplied with nutrient solutions having different pH and aluminium concentration (pH 6.0, pH 3.5 or pH 3.5+Al). The low pH treatment had the same nutrient composition plus HCl, whereas the aluminium treatment (pH 3.5+Al) was induced by adding 1.0mM of AlCl<inf>3</inf>·6H<inf>2</inf>O. The AM root colonization was higher in the control treatment (pH 6.0; 48.5%), followed by pH 3.5 (23.4%), and finally in pH 3.5+Al treatment (17.1%). Significant depression of yield, biomass, SPAD index, leaf area, N, P, Mg, Fe, and Zn concentration in leaf tissue was observed in response to low pH level with more detrimental effects with pH 3.5+Al. The inoculated plants under acidity and Al conditions had higher total, marketable yield, and total biomass than noninoculated plants. Zucchini-fruit quality, in particular fruit dry matter, total soluble-solids content, P, and Fe concentration, was improved by mycorrhizal colonization. Mycorrhized zucchini plants grown under acidity and Al conditions had a higher macronutrient concentration in leaf tissue compared to noninoculated plants. The better crop performance in inoculated plants were related to the capacity of maintaining higher SPAD index, lower electrolyte leakage, and better nutritional status (high N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, and B and low Al accumulation) in response to Al stress with respect to -AM plants. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Acid soil; Aluminium; Arbuscular mycorrhizal; Cucurbita pepo L.; Nutritional status; PH level","Andrade, S.A.L., Mazzafera, P., Schiavinato, M.A., Silveira, A.P.D., Arbuscular mycorrhizal association in coffee (2009) J.

Ghrelin-reactive immunoglobulins (Ig) were recently identified in healthy and obese humans showing abilities to increase ghrelin's stability and orexigenic effects. Here we studied if ghrelin-reactive Ig are associated with anxiety and depression and with the stress-induced cortisol response in a general population of adolescents. Furthermore, to test the possible infectious origin of ghrelin-reactive Ig, their levels were compared with serum IgG against common viruses. Methods: We measured ghrelin-reactive IgM, IgG and IgA in serum samples of 1199 adolescents from the Dutch TRAILS study and tested their associations with 1) anxiety and depression symptoms assessed with the Youth Self-Report, 2) stress-induced salivary cortisol levels and 3) IgG against human herpesvirus 1, 2, 4 and 6 and Influenza A and B viruses. Results: Ghrelin-reactive IgM and IgG correlated positively with levels of antibodies against Influenza A virus. Ghrelin-reactive IgM correlated negatively with antibodies against Influenza B virus. Ghrelin-reactive IgM correlated positively with anxiety scores in girls and ghrelin-reactive IgG correlated with stress-induced cortisol secretion, but these associations were weak and not significant after correction for multiple testing. Conclusion: These data indicate that production of ghrelin-reactive autoantibodies could be influenced by viral infections. Serum levels of ghrelin-reactive autoantibodies probably do not play a role in regulating anxiety, depression and the stress-response in adolescents from the general population. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Anxiety; Autoantibodies; Depression; Infection; Molecular mimicry; Peptide hormones","Achenbach, T.M., Dumenci, L., Rescorla, L.A., DSM-oriented and empirically based approaches to constructing scales from the same item pools (2003) J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol, 32, pp. 328-340; Asakawa, A., Inui, A., Kaga, T., Yuzuriha, H., Nagata, T., Fujimiya, M., A role of ghrelin in neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to stress in mice (2001) Neuroendocrinology, 74, pp. 143-147; Bender, R., Lange, S., Adjusting for multiple testing - when and how?

Astrocytic glutamate dysfunction, in particular, has been recently linked with the pathogenesis and treatment of mood disorders, including anxiety and depression. System xc- is a glial cystine/glutamate antiporter that is responsible for nonvesicular glutamate release in various regions of the brain. Although system xc- is involved in glutamate signal transduction, its possible role in mediating anxiety or depressive-like behaviors is currently unknown. In the present study, we phenotyped adult and aged system xc- deficient mice in a battery of tests for anxiety and depressive-like behavior (open field, light/dark test, elevated plus maze, novelty suppressed feeding, forced swim test, tail suspension test). Concomitantly, we evaluated the sensorimotor function of system xc- deficient mice, using motor and sensorimotor based tests (rotarod, adhesive removal test, nest building test). Finally, due to the presence and potential functional relevance of system xc- in the eye, we investigated the visual acuity of system xc- deficient mice (optomotor test). Our results indicate that loss of system xc- does not affect motor or sensorimotor function, in either adult or aged mice, in any of the paradigms investigated. Similarly, loss of system xc- does not affect basic visual acuity, in either adult or aged mice. On the other hand, in the open field and light/dark tests, and forced swim and tail suspension tests respectively, we could observe significant anxiolytic and antidepressive-like effects in system xc- deficient mice that in certain cases (light/dark, forced swim) were age-dependent. These findings indicate that, under physiological conditions, nonvesicular glutamate release via system xc- mediates aspects of higher brain function related to anxiety and depression, but does not influence sensorimotor function or spatial vision. As such, modulation of system xc- might constitute the basis of innovative interventions in mood disorders. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Anxiety; Depression; Sensorimotor; System xc-; Vision; XCT","Bai, F., Li, X., Clay, M., Lindstrom, T., Skolnick, P., Intra- and interstrain differences in models of ""behavioral despair"" (2001) Pharmacol Biochem Behav, 70, pp. 187-192; Baker, D.A., Xi, Z.X., Shen, H., Swanson, C.J., Kalivas, P.W., The origin and neuronal function of in vivo nonsynaptic glutamate (2002) J Neurosci, 22, pp. 9134-9141; Baker, D.A., McFarland, K., Lake, R.W., Shen, H., Tang, X.C., Toda, S., Neuroadaptations in cystine-glutamate exchange underlie cocaine relapse (2003) Nat Neurosci, 6, pp. 743-749; Bergink, V., van Megen, H.J., Westenberg, H.G., Glutamate and anxiety (2004) Eur Neuropsychopharmacol, 14, pp. 175-183; Bouet, V., Boulouard, M., Toutain, J., Divoux, D., Bernaudin, M., Schumann-Bard, P., The adhesive removal test: a sensitive method to assess sensorimotor deficits in mice (2009) Nat Protoc, 4, pp. 1560-1564; Bridges, C.C., Kekuda, R., Wang, H., Prasad, P.D., Mehta, P., Huang, W., Structure, function, and regulation of human cystine/glutamate transporter in retinal pigment epithelial cells (2001) Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci, 42, pp. 47-54; Bridges, R., Lutgen, V., Lobner, D., Baker, D.A., Thinking outside the cleft to understand synaptic activity: contribution of the cystine-glutamate antiporter (System xc-) to normal and pathological glutamatergic signaling (2012) Pharmacol Rev, 64, pp. 780-802; Browne, C.A., Lucki, I., Antidepressant effects of ketamine: mechanisms underlying fast-acting novel antidepressants (2013) Front Pharmacol, 4, p. 161; Burdo, J., Dargusch, R., Schubert, D., Distribution of the cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc- in the brain, kidney, and duodenum (2006) J Histochem Cytochem, 54, pp. 549-557; Button, K.S., Ioannidis, J.P., Mokrysz, C., Nosek, B.A., Flint, J., Robinson, E.S., Power failure: why small sample size undermines the reliability of neuroscience (2013) Nat Rev Neurosci, 14, pp. 365-376; Byrne, G.J., Pachana, N.A., Anxiety and depression in the elderly: do we know any more?

The recently proposed depression distress amplification model appears to have promise for explaining the relations between anxiety, depression, and suicidality, but it has not been tested in adolescents. Participants were 524 adolescents followed over two years. Baseline data for the current report were collected by trained interviewers while the adolescents were in eighth grade. Data were obtained in the same manner when the adolescents were in tenth grade. Baseline anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns significantly predicted suicidal ideation two years later, above and beyond baseline suicidal ideation and depression. Further, consistent with the depression distress amplification model, anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns interacted with depressive symptoms to predict suicidal ideation. This report extends the empirical and theoretical support for a relationship between anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns and suicidality. © 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.","Anxiety;

No existing scales are specifically designed to measure it. Common practice is to adapt scales originally developed for other circumstances. We designed this study to validate and determine the psychometric values for AD screening in Brazil. Methods We collected clinical and socio-demographic data in the second gestational trimester. The following instruments were also administered during that period: MINI-PLUS, EPDS, BDI and HAM-D. Results At the time of assessment, 17.34% of the patients were depressed, and 31.98% met the diagnostic criteria for lifetime major depression. All instruments showed an area under the curve in a receiver operating characteristic analysis greater than 0.85, with the BDI achieving a 0.90 and being the best-performing screening instrument. A score ≥11 on the EPDS (81.58% sensitivity, 73.33% specificity), ≥15 on the BDI (82.00% sensitivity, 84.26% specificity) and ≥9 on the HAM-D (87.76% sensitivity, 74.60% specificity) revealed great dichotomy between depressed and non-depressed patients. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (ρ) among the scales had good values (EPDS vs. BDI 0.79; BDI vs. HAM-D 0.70, and EPDS vs. HAM-D 0.67). Limitations This study was transversal, assessing only women in the second gestational trimester. Results may be applicable only to the Brazilian population since psychometric properties may vary with the population under study. Major depression can amplify somatic symptomatology, affecting depressive rating scale data. Conclusion AD is highly prevalent in Brazil. To address the problem of under-recognition, physicians can use the EPDS, BDI and HAM-D to identify AD. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The mediating effects of self-esteem in the relationship between insecure attachments (preoccupied and fearful types) were moderated by the mother's parenting efficacy. More specifically, mothers with high maternal efficacy (scores. ≥. 32, upper 10th percentile) were protected from the detrimental impact of attachment insecurity and low self-esteem on maternal depression, compared with mothers with low parenting-efficacy.

However, human studies about miR-16 of patients with MDD are still lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible involvement of miR-16 in the mechanism of MDD in humans. Methods Thirty-six drug-free patients with MDD and 30 healthy controls aged between 18 and 45 years old were recruited. 24-item Hamilton depression scale test was performed for each subject. MiR-16 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood, as well as serotonin in CSF were assayed by the qRT-PCR or ELISA method. To confirm the role of CSF miR-16 in MDD, animal study about intracerebroventricular injection of anti-miR-16 was also performed. Depression-like behaviors, CSF miR-16 and serotonin, blood miR-16, and raphe SERT protein of rats were also tested. Results CSF miR-16 in MDD patients was significantly lower than that in controls. It was negatively correlated with Hamilton scores and positively associated with CSF serotonin. However, blood miR-16 was not significantly different between two groups and it was not statistically correlated with CSF miR-16. In animal study, anti-miR-16-treated rats were evaluated to exhibit depression-like behaviors, extremely lower CSF miR-16, significantly higher CSF serotonin, and obviously higher raphe SERT protein than control rats. Limitation We did not detect SERT protein in human brain due to the impossibility of sample collection. Conclusion Our study suggested that CSF miR-16 participated in the physiopathology of MDD via the modulation of serotonin transmitter system in brain. ©2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here we investigate if functional abnormalities in this area, indexed by attenuated responses to emotionally arousing stimuli, are also family-history-dependent. Methods Neuromagnetic activity for emotional and neutral complex scenes was recorded by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 20 depressed patients without, 8 depressed patients with FH, and 15 healthy controls. Emotion-sensitive neuronal steady state responses were cortical source localized and tested for group-by-emotion interactions. Results The group-by-emotion interaction (F(4, 80)=4.4, p=0.004) was explained by a significant modulation of right temporoparietal cortex activity by emotional arousal in controls and patients without FH. This effect was reduced in FH positive patients. The difference between patient groups remained when clinical variables such as symptom severity were accounted for. Limitations All patients were medicated, but differences between patient groups remained after accounting for medication dosage. Further, the sample size was limited, but data-driven resampling statistics showed the robustness of our effects. Finally, the sample consists of female patients only and we cannot generalize our results to male samples. Conclusions Patients with FH show impaired recruitment of attention-relevant cortical circuitry by emotional stimuli. The neuroanatomical locus of this effect accords with previous reports on structural abnormalities and electrophysiological deficits at rest in individuals with FH. Our results speak to the relevance of right temporoparietal dysfunction in emotional information processing as a potential endophenotype for depression with FH. ©2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Dopamine has also been associated with components of anhedonia, which is one of the cardinal symptoms of depression and refers to lack of responsiveness to pleasurable stimuli. This raises the question whether low agency is associated with anhedonia symptoms in depression and if agency and anhedonia are characterized by similar neurobiological mechanisms. To address this hypothesis, we tested whether questionnaire measures of agency and anhedonia are correlated within depressed (. n=. 20) and non-depressed (. n=. 22) participants. Further, we investigated whether dopamine-related signatures in the EEG recorded during a gambling task (feedback-evoked theta activity, and frontal versus posterior theta activity) similarly relate to agency and anhedonia. Results indicated that anhedonia was significantly elevated in the depression group, and negatively correlated with agency. However, while theta activity evoked by negative vs. positive feedback was sensitive to anhedonia and depression status but unrelated to agency, frontal versus parietal theta activity predicted agency, but was unrelated to anhedonia and depression. Together, this double dissociation suggests that in spite of considerable phenotypical overlap, anhedonia and agency may be linked to partially distinct neurobiological markers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","BAS;

Total sleep time improved by 99min from baseline to week 12 in the CBT-I arm, but not in the SH arm. In addition, our pilot yielded important products to facilitate future studies: the youth-adapted CBT-I program; the study protocol; estimates of recruitment, retention, and attrition; and performance and parameters of candidate outcome measures.

These diseases that individually are difficult to treat often co-exist, thereby compounding the patient's disability and impairment as well as the challenge of successful treatment. The development of efficacious treatments for these comorbid disorders requires a more comprehensive understanding of their linked associations through common neuromodulators, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), and various neurotransmitters, as well as common neuroanatomical pathways and structures, including the hippocampal brain region. This review discusses the interaction between depression and chronic pain, emphasizing the fundamental role of the hippocampus in the development and maintenance of both disorders. The focus of this review addresses the hypothesis that hippocampal expressed TNFα serves as a therapeutic target for management of chronic pain and major depressive disorder (MDD). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Brain; Chronic pain; Comorbid; Depression; Hippocampus; Tumor necrosis factor-α","Ackenheil, M., Genetics and pathophysiology of affective disorders: relationship to fibromyalgia (1998) Z.

Although such behavioral depression traditionally is attributed to drug-induced depletion of brain monoamines, we examined the potential contribution of adenosine signaling, which is plausibly activated by reserpine treatment and contributes to behavioral depression in other paradigms. Whereas peripheral administration of the highly selective A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (0.5, 1.0, or 5.0mg/kg i.p.) 15min before swim testing failed to improve performance in reserpine-treated rats, swim deficits were completely reversed by 7mg/kg of the nonselective receptor antagonist caffeine. Performance deficits were also reversed by the nonselective A2 antagonist 3,7-dimethylxanthine (0, 0.5, 1.0mg/kg i.p.), and the highly selective A2A receptor antagonist (CSC: 8-(3chlorostyral)caffeine) (0.01, 0.1, or 1.0mg/kg i.p.) in a dose-dependent manner.

Factors of soil formation, such as soil climate and biota, have been substantially altered by artificial drainage and the associated land use change. Efforts to restore wetlands are ongoing but success has been limited in some cases. The objectives of this study were to 1) quantify alterations of wetland soils due to artificial drainage in the recently glaciated, Des Moines Lobe region of north-central Iowa; and 2) compare physical and chemical soil properties of farmed (artificially drained) wetlands to those undergoing restoration efforts and those considered natural (undrained). Wetlands in thirteen Des Moines Lobe closed depressions were sampled during this study representing three distinct populations: farmed, restored and natural soils. There were distinct visual differences in soil morphological properties between farmed and restored wetlands and farmed depressions had significantly higher soil nutrients (NO3, P and K). Fewer differences were noted between restored and natural wetlands, implying that restoration of wetlands was returning soils to a more natural state in a relatively short time (15-20years) compared to the time since they were initially drained (50-100years). Study results suggest soil alteration due to artificial drainage and provide important context for establishing realistic timeframes for wetland soil restoration in closed depressions located on the Des Moines Lobe. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropedogenesis; Artificial drainage; Closed depression; Des Moines Lobe; Reconstruction; Wetlands","Ballantine, K., Schneider, R., Groffman, P., Lehmann, J., Soil properties and vegetative development in four restored freshwater depressional wetlands (2012) Soil Sci.

Most studies so far focused on the influence of attributions to medication for anxiety and depression disorders. We investigated the effects of patients' attributions made after acute treatment on the long-term outcome of antidepressant medication (ADM) and psychological treatment (behavioural activation, BA). Data are based on a randomized trial testing the effectiveness of BA vs. ADM for major depression (MDD) in Iran. Patients with MDD (N=100) were randomized to BA (N=50) or ADM (N=50). Patients' attributions were assessed at post-test (after completion of the treatments). Scores on an attribution questionnaire were factor analysed, and factor scores were retained as predictors of depressive symptoms at 1-year follow-up. Regression analysis was used to test whether attributions predicted depressive symptoms at 1-yr follow-up, controlling for symptom level, condition, and their interaction at post-test. Belief in coping efficacy was the only attribution factor significantly predicting 1-year HRSD scores, controlling for condition, post-test HRSD and their interaction. It also mediated the condition differences at follow-up. Credit to self was the single attribution factor that predicted BDI follow-up scores, controlling for condition, posttest BDI, and their interaction. It partially mediated the condition differences on the BDI at follow-up. Attribution to increased coping capacities and giving credit to self appear essential. In the long-term (at 1 year follow-up), the difference in outcome between BA and ADM (with BA being superior to ADM) is at least partially mediated by attributions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Antidepressant medication; Attributions; Behavioural activation; Major depressive disorder","(2000) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV-TR, , American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc; (2010) Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder, , http://www.psych.org/guidelines/mdd2010, American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc, Available at:; Basoglu, M., Marks, I.M., Klic, C., Brewin, C.R., swinson, R.P., Alprazolam and exposure for panic disorder with agoraphobia.
