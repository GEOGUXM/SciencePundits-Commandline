A scoping review was performed to examine the efficacy of VR-based interventions on balance and mobility disorders post stroke. Twenty-four articles in the English language examining VR game-based interventions and outcomes directed at balance and mobility disorders were included. Various VR systems (customized and commercially available) were used as rehabilitation tools. Outcome measures included laboratory and clinical measures of balance and gait. Outcome measures of dynamic balance showed significant improvements following VR-based interventions as compared to other interventions. Further, it was observed that VR-based intervention may have favorable effects in improving walking speed and the ability to deal with environmental challenges, which may also facilitate independent community ambulation. VR-based therapy thus has the potential to be a useful tool for balance and gait training for stroke rehabilitation. Utilization of motor learning principles related to task-related training may have been an important factor leading to positive results. Other principles such as repetition, feedback etc. were used in studies but were not explored explicitly and may need to be investigated to further improve the strength of results. Lastly, robust study designs with appropriate attention towards the intensity and dose-response aspects of VR training, clear study objectives and suitable outcomes would further aid in determining evidence-based efficacy for VR game-based interventions in the future. © 2015 Darekar et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Balance deficits; Cerebrovascular accident; Gait; Gait retraining; Game-based rehabilitation; Physiotherapy; Posture; Rehabilitation; Stroke; Virtual reality","Fang, J., Alderman, M.H., Tu, J.V., Trend of stroke hospitalization, United States, 1988-1997 (2001) Stroke, 32, pp. 2221-2226. , 1:STN:280:DC%2BD3MrktFGmsA%3D%3D 11588304; Lloyd-Jones, D., Adams, R.J., Brown, T.M., Carnethon, M., Dai, S., Heart disease and stroke statistics-2010 Update: A report from the American heart Association (2010) Circulation, 121, pp. e46-e215; Mayo, N.E., Nadeau, L.M., Daskalopoulous, M.P., Coté, R.M., The evolution of stroke in Quebec: A 15-year perspective (2007) Neurology, 68, pp. 1122-1127. , 17404194; Michael, K.M., Allen, J.K., Macko, R.F., Reduced ambulatory activity after stroke: The role of balance, gait, and cardiovascular fitness (2005) Arch Phys Med Rehab, 86, pp. 1552-1556; Mayo, N.E., Wood-Dauphinee, S., Coté, R., Durcan, L., Carlton, J., Activity, participation, and quality of life 6 months poststroke (2002) Arch Phys Med Rehabil, 83, pp. 1035-1042. , 12161823; Lord, S.E., McPherson, K., McNaughton, H.K., Rochester, L., Weatherall, M., Community ambulation after stroke: how important and obtainable is it and what measures appear predictive?

The network virtualization concept consists in the dynamic creation of several co-existing logical network instances (or virtual networks) over a shared physical network infrastructure. We have previously proposed a service-oriented hierarchical business model for virtual networking environments. This model promotes the idea of network as a service, by considering the functionalities offered by different types of network resources as services of different levels – services that can be dynamically discovered, used, and composed. In this paper, we propose an open, virtual, multi-services networking architecture enabling the realization of our business model. We also demonstrate the operation of our architecture using a virtualized QoS-enabled VoIP scenario. Moreover, virtual routing and control level performance was evaluated using proof-of-concept prototyping. Several important findings were made in the course of this work; one is that service-oriented concepts can be used to build open, flexible, and collaborative virtual networking environments. Another finding is that some of the existing open source virtual routing solutions such as Vyatta are only suitable for building small to medium size virtual networking infrastructures. © 2015, El Barachi et al.; licensee Springer.","Future Internet; Network virtualization; Service-oriented architecture; Virtual routing; Vyatta","Chowdhury, N., Boutaba, R., Network virtualization: state of the art and research challenges (2009) IEEE Commun Mag, 47 (7), pp. 20-26; Rosen, E., Rekhter, Y., BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) (2006) RFC 4364, Internet Engineering Task Force; Turner JS and Taylor “Diversifying the Internet”.

As a consequence, the demand for computing, storage and communication resources to be deployed in data center infrastructures is increasing dramatically. This trend is fostering new forms of infrastructure sharing such as cloud federations, where the excess workload is smartly distributed across multiple data centers, following some kind of mutual agreement among the participating cloud providers. Federated clouds can obtain great advantages from virtualization technologies and, in particular, from multiple virtual machine live migration techniques, which allow to flexibly move bulk workload across heterogeneous computing environments with minimal service disruption. However, a quantitative characterization of the performance of the inter-data center network infrastructure underlying the cloud federation is essential to guarantee user’s quality of service and optimize provider’s resource utilization. The main contribution of this paper is the definition and application of an analytical model for dimensioning inter-data center network capacity in order to achieve some given performance levels, assuming some simple multiple virtual machine live migration strategies. An extensive set of results are provided that allow to understand the impact of the many parameters involved in the design of a cloud federation network. © 2015, Cerroni; licensee Springer.","Cloud computing; Cross-cloud communication; Inter-data center communication; Virtual machine live migration; Virtualization","Höfer, C.N., Karagiannis, G., Cloud computing services: taxonomy and comparison (2011) J Internet Serv Appl, 2 (2), pp. 81-94; Chen, M., Jin, H., Wen, Y., Leung, V.C.M., Enabling technologies for future data center networking: a primer (2013) IEEE Netw, 27 (4), pp. 8-15; Rochwerger, B., Breitgand, D., Epstein, A., Hadas, D., Loy, I., Nagin, K., Tordsson, J., Toffetti, G., Reservoir - When one cloud is not enough (2011) IEEE Comput, 44 (3), pp. 44-51; Toosi, A.N., Calheiros, R.N., Buyya, R., Interconnected cloud computing environments: challenges, taxonomy, and survey (2014) ACM Comput Surv, 47 (1), p. 7; (2014) Data Center Interconnect, , http://www.btisystems.com/solutions/data-center-interconnect.aspx, Accessed 10 Sept 2014; Clark, C., Fraser, K., Hand, S., Hansen, J.G., Jul, E., Limpach, C., Pratt, I., Warfield, A., Live migration of virtual machines (2005) Proc. of the 2nd USENIX Symp on Networked Systems Design & Implementation (NSDI 2005), Boston, MA, , USENIX Association, Berkeley:; Foundation, T.O.N., Software-defined networking: the new norm for networks (2012) ONF White Paper, , https://www.opennetworking.org; Jain, R., Paul, S., Network virtualization and software defined networking for cloud computing: a survey (2013) IEEE Commun Mag, 51 (11), pp. 24-31; Wang, X., Du, Z., Chen, Y., Li, S., Virtualization-based autonomic resource management for multi-tier web applications in shared data center (2008) J Syst Software, 81 (9), pp. 1591-1608; Cerroni, W., Multiple virtual machine live migration in federated cloud systems (2014) Proc. of the IEEE INFOCOM Workshop on Cross-cloud Systems (CrossCloud 2014), Toronto, Canada, , IEEE, USA:; Cuadrado, F., Navas, A., Dueñas, J.C., Vaquero, L.M., Research challenges for cross-cloud applications (2014) Proc. of the IEEE INFOCOM Workshop on Cross-cloud Systems (CrossCloud 2014), Toronto, Canada, , IEEE, USA:; Papagianni, C., Leivadeas, A., Papavassiliou, S., Maglaris, V., Cervelló-Pastor, C., Monje, A., On the optimal allocation of virtual resources in cloud computing networks (2013) IEEE T Comput, 62 (6), pp. 1060-1071; Guo, C., Lu, G., Wang, H.J., Yang, S., Kong, C., Sun, P., Wu, W., Zhang, Y., SecondNet: a data center network virtualization architecture with bandwidth guarantees (2010) Proc. of the 6th ACM Int Conf on Emerging Networking Experiments and Technologies (CoNEXT 2010), Philadelphia, PA, , ACM, New York:; Shrivastava, V., Zerfos, P., Lee, K.-W., Jamjoom, H., Liu, Y.-H., Banerjee, S., Application-aware virtual machine migration in data centers (2011) Proc. of the 30th IEEE Int Conf on Computer Communications (INFOCOM 2011), Shanghai, China, , IEEE, USA:; Zhani, M.F., Zhang, Q., Simon, G., Boutaba, R., VDC Planner: dynamic migration-aware virtual data center embedding for clouds (2013) Proc. of the IFIP/IEEE Int Symp on Integrated Network Management (IM 2013), Ghent, Belgium, , IEEE, USA:; Kantarci, B., Foschini, L., Corradi, A., Mouftah, H.T., Design of energy-efficient cloud systems via network and resource virtualization.

The design and validation of the maintenance strategy are key challenges which remain to be resolved due to the complex mechanical structure, the expensive physical mockup, and the potential risk of radiation hazards. In this paper, a high-immersive interactive simulation system has been developed to simulate and verify maintenance strategy by using virtual reality. Main features include: (1) rapid modeling and real-time rendering of the large-scale three-dimensional radiation scene, (2) real-time interactive roaming by tracking the 6-DOF body motion, (3) the interactive disassembly simulation of the mechanism structure were controlled by the hand gestures. The system can provide designers with an intuitive experience environment, an efficient and flexible interactive way as well as the whole process simulation of maintenance strategy. It has been applied to simulate and verify the maintenance strategy of the spallation target proton beam window for China LEAd-based research Reactor (CLEAR-I). The simulation result proved the maintenance strategy of proton beam window was reasonable and feasible. The system was useful to verify maintenance strategy, optimize maintenance operation, reduce intervention time and exposure dose of workers. It provided a high efficiency and low cost way for simulating maintenance strategy to meet the requirements of ALARA rules and can be extended to other nuclear facilities. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","CLEAR-I; High-immersive simulation; Maintenance strategy; Motion track","Burdea, G., Coiffet, P., (2013) Virtual Reality Technology, 16, pp. 663-664. , Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments; Cao, R., Wu, Y., Pei, X., Multi-objective optimization of inverse planning for accurate radiotherapy (2011) Chin.

Using a convenience sample of 301 Facebook users, path analyses were conducted to determine how individual factors, social cohesion, and motives affect the honesty, valence, and intent of self-disclosure. Results showed that U&G provided a useful model for exploring the relationships among study variables. Facebook users motivated by relationship maintenance were generally more honest, intentional, and positive than others. Higher self-esteem was related to more positive self-disclosure, as well. Conversely, participants motivated to use Facebook for virtual community and companionship disclosed the most dishonest, unintentional, and negative information.

Potential problems relating to MMORPG play have emerged, particularly in relation to being addicted to playing in such virtual environments. In the present study, factors relating to online gaming addiction and motivations for playing in MMORPGs were examined to establish whether they were associated with addiction. A sample comprised 1167 gamers who were surveyed about their gaming motivations. Latent Class Analysis revealed seven classes of motivations for playing MMORPGs, which comprised: (1) novelty; (2) highly social and discovery-orientated; (3) aggressive, anti-social and non-curious; (4) highly social, competitive; (5) low intensity enjoyment; (6) discovery-orientated; and (7) social classes. Five classes of gaming addiction-related experiences were extracted including: (1) high risk of addiction, (2) time-affected, (3) intermediate risk of addiction, (4) emotional control, and (5) low risk of addiction classes. Gender was a significant predictor of intermediate risk of addiction and emotional control class membership. Membership of the high risk of addiction class was significantly predicted by belonging to a highly social and competitive class, a novelty class, or an aggressive, anti-social, and non-curious class. Implications of these findings for assessment and treatment of MMORPG addiction are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Addiction; games; Latent Class Analysis; Massively multiplayer online role-playing; Motivations; Online gaming; Risk","Anestis, M.D., Selby, E.A., Joiner, T.E., The role of urgency in maladaptive behaviors (2007) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 45 (12), pp. 3018-3029; Anthony, E.K., Robbins, D.E., A latent class analysis of resilient development among early adolescents living in public housing (2013) Children and Youth Services Review, 35 (1), pp. 82-90; Beard, K.W., Internet addiction: A review of current assessment techniques and potential assessment questions (2005) CyberPsychology & Behavior, 8 (1), pp. 7-14; Billieux, J., Chanal, J., Khazaal, Y., Rochat, L., Gay, P., Zullino, D., Psychological predictors of problematic involvement in massively multiplayer online role-playing games: Illustration in a sample of male cybercafe players (2011) Psychopathology, 44 (3), pp. 165-171; Billieux, J., Van Der Linden, M., Achab, S., Khazaal, Y., Paraskevopoulos, L., Zullino, D., Why do you play World of Warcraft?

This growth forces the community to provide tremendous efforts in order to maintain the accuracy and structure of the database. To deal with such amounts of data, Wikipedia users have developed automated programs - bots - to help them to do some of the maintenance tasks. However, it is unclear how human users react to the actions of these bots. Based on a corpus of 6528 interventions (2353 different discussions) of users on talk pages of 50 bots active on English-language Wikipedia pages between January 4, 2012 and January 2, 2013, we analyzed the reactions of users depending of the characteristics of the bots' actions. Bots activity was strongly associated with the functioning Wikipedia internal community. Bots whose activity was mostly related to the work of other users (e.g. high degree of constraint or visibility) elicited more responses. By combining the different characteristics of the bots, we were able to define two opposite ""ideotypes"" of bots with distinct behavior: ""servant bots"" which mainly do repetitive and laborious work instead of human users; and ""policing bots"" proactively enforcing Wikipedia's guidelines and norms, which elicited more polarized responses from users (either negative or positive rather than neutral). Our results demonstrated a surprisingly high level of acceptance of bots, modulated by differential reactions in function of the actual behavior of the bots. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The method consists of two stages. The first stage approximates the Dantzig selector through a fixed-point formulation of solutions to the Dantzig selector problem; the second stage constructs a new estimator by regressing data onto the support of the approximated Dantzig selector. The proposed method is compared to an alternating direction method. The results of numerical simulations using both the proposed method and the alternating direction method on synthetic and real-world data sets are presented. The numerical simulations demonstrate that the two methods produce results of similar quality; however the proposed method tends to be significantly faster. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Alternating direction method; Dantzig selector; Fixed-point algorithm; Proximity operator","Bauschke, H.L., Combettes, P.L., Convex Analysis and Monotone Operator Theory in Hilbert Spaces (2011) AMS Books in Mathematics, , Springer, New York; Beck, A., Teboulle, M., A fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm for linear inverse problems (2009) SIAM J.

Given the effort and investment involved in the creation of these worlds, more studies are needed which measure the learning gains. In particular, greater understanding is needed concerning what aspects of the technology are beneficial for learning what sort of content and in what context. We conducted two experimental studies involving 129 biology students over a two-year period that sought to make a contribution towards this understanding. Our study compared the knowledge of students after a traditional classroom lecture about a biological theorem known as Marginal Value Theorem, with their knowledge after they were exposed to simulations of two-dimensional models developed in NetLogo and three-dimensional models developed in Unity3D. Perhaps due to cognitive overload and distractors in the virtual world, it appears that the two-dimensional NetLogo model delivered better learning outcomes. ©2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study uses a quality model to test users' satisfaction and intention to recommend marker-based augmented reality applications. By applying process theory, this study also investigates the differences in these constructs between high- and low-innovativeness groups visiting a theme park in Jeju Island, South Korea. Questionnaires administered to 241 theme park visitors revealed that content, personalized service, and system quality affect users' satisfaction and intention to recommend augmented reality applications. In addition, personal innovativeness was found to reinforce the relationships among content quality, personalized service quality, system quality, and satisfaction with augmented reality. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Augmented reality; DeLone and McLean model; Personal innovativeness; Process theory; Satisfaction; Smartphone","Agarwal, R., Prasad, J., Aconceptual and operational definition of personal innovativeness in the domain of information technology (1998) Information Systems Research, 9, pp. 204-215; Ahamed, L.A., Mohideen, R.K., Service quality and guests behavioural intentions: a study in the Kodaikanal Star hotels (2015) International Journal of Management, 6 (1), pp. 450-567; Ahuja, M.K., Thatcher, J.B., Moving beyond intentions and toward the theory of trying: effects of work environments and gender on post-adoption information technology use (2005) MIS Quarterly, 29 (3), pp. 427-459; Aladwania, A.M., Palvia, P.C., Developing and validating an instrument for measuring user-perceived web quality (2002) Information & Management, 39, pp. 467-476; Almossawi, M.A., Customer satisfaction in the mobile telecom industry in Bahrain: antecedents and consequences (2012) International Journal of Marketing Studies, 4 (6), pp. 140-156; Ansari, A., Kheirabadi, A., Ghalamkari, S., Khanjari, A.R., Investigation the relationship among mobile value-added services quality, customer satisfaction and the continuance intention: case study, Hamrah Avval Operator (2013) International Journal of Information Science and Management, pp. 67-84. , Special Issue (ECDC 2013); Ayeh, J.K., Au, N., Law, R., Predicting the intention to use consumer-generated media for travel planning (2013) Tourism Management, 35, pp. 132-143; Baron, R.M., Kenney, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51 (6), pp. 1173-1182; Bayaraktar, E., Tatoglu, E., Turkyilmaz, A., Delen, D., Zaum, S., Measuring the efficiency of customer satisfaction and loyalty for mobile phone brands with DEA (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39, pp. 99-106; Benyon, D., Quigley, A., O'Keefe, B., Riva, G., Presence and digital tourism (2013) AI and Society, pp. 1-9; Bhattacherjee, A., Sanford, C., Influence processes for information technology acceptance: an elaboration likelihood model (2006) MIS Quarterly, 30 (4), pp. 805-825; Bigné, J.E., Sánchez, M.I., Sánchez, J., Tourism image, evaluation variables and after purchase behaviour: inter-relationship (2001) Tourism Management, 22 (6), pp. 607-616; Casella, G., Coelho, M., (2013) Augmented heritage - Situating augmented reality mobile apps in cultural heritage communication, , Paper presented at the International Conference on Information Systems and Design of Communication, Lisboa, Portugal; Chae, M., Kim, J., Kim, H., Ryu, H., Information quality for mobile Internet services: a theoretical model with empirical validation (2002) Electronic Markets, 12 (1), pp. 38-46; Chen, L.Y., The quality if mobile shopping systems and its impact on purchase intention and performance (2013) International Journal of Managing Information Technology, 5 (2), pp. 23-33; Chen, C.F., Chen, F.S., Experience quality, perceived value, satisfaction and behavioral intentions for heritage tourists (2010) Tourism Management, 31, pp. 29-35; Cheng, K.H., Tsai, T.T., Affordances of augmented reality in science learning: suggestions for future research (2013) Journal of Science Education and Technology, 22 (4), pp. 449-462; Chiles, T.H., Process theorizing: too important to ignore in a Kaledic world (2003) Academy of Management Learning and Education, 2 (3), pp. 288-291; Chin, W.W., The partial least squares approach to structural equation modeling (1998) Modern methods for business research, pp. 295-336. , Lawrence Erlbaum, New Jersey, G.A.

The approach is reliable and computationally effective as it consists of the cascade solution of two linear inverse problems. The first problem yields a qualitative image of the targets (i.e., their location and approximate shape) and the information needed to cast a set of virtual experiments wherein a linear scattering model that implicitly depends on unknown targets holds true. By relying on such a model, it is possible to achieve, via linear inversion, a quantitative estimate of the targets' electric permittivity and conductivity in a much broader range of cases as compared with traditional approximations, such as the Born approximation. The quantitative imaging capabilities of the proposed method are enhanced by means of an original strategy, in which the features of virtual experiments are exploited to counteract the data reduction caused by the aspect limitation of the measurement configuration. Results against simulated data are reported to show the capability to successfully image nonweak scatters. © 2015 IEEE.","Born approximation (BA); cross borehole; ground penetrating radar (GPR); linear inversion; tomographic imaging","Daniels, D.J., (2004) Ground Penetrating Radar, , 2nd ed.

Matrix completion (MC) has recently been introduced as a method for transductive (semisupervised) multilabel classification, and has several distinct advantages, including robustness to missing data and background noise in both feature and label space. However, it is limited by only considering data represented by a single-view feature, which cannot precisely characterize images containing several semantic concepts. To utilize multiple features taken from different views, we have to concatenate the different features as a long vector. However, this concatenation is prone to over-fitting and often leads to very high time complexity in MC-based image classification. Therefore, we propose to weightedly combine the MC outputs of different views, and present the multiview MC (MVMC) framework for transductive multilabel image classification. To learn the view combination weights effectively, we apply a cross-validation strategy on the labeled set. In particular, MVMC splits the labeled set into two parts, and predicts the labels of one part using the known labels of the other part. The predicted labels are then used to learn the view combination coefficients. In the learning process, we adopt the average precision (AP) loss, which is particular suitable for multilabel image classification, since the ranking-based criteria are critical for evaluating a multilabel classification system. A least squares loss formulation is also presented for the sake of efficiency, and the robustness of the algorithm based on the AP loss compared with the other losses is investigated. Experimental evaluation on two real-world data sets (PASCAL VOC' 07 and MIR Flickr) demonstrate the effectiveness of MVMC for transductive (semisupervised) multilabel image classification, and show that MVMC can exploit complementary properties of different features and output-consistent labels for improved multilabel image classification. © 2015 IEEE.","average precision; Image classification; matrix completion; multi-label; multi-view; transductive","Boutell, M.R., Luo, J., Shen, X., Brown, C.M., Learning multi-label scene classification (2004) Pattern Recognit., 37 (9), pp. 1757-1771. , Sep; Tsoumakas, G., Katakis, I., Multi-label classification: An overview (2007) Int.

This might be realised behaviourally, pharmacologically or via more radical routes such as brain stimulation. Successful approaches in each of these domains include trial-spacing, rest, and NMDA or cholinergic receptor modulation, but the goal of enhancement has to be clear as some approaches can enhance in one domain but inhibit in another. Enhancement may also extend the duration of memory rather than augment encoding, an idea conceptually embedded into the synaptic-tagging-and-capture theory of memory persistence. In addition, recent work on human spatial memory reflects new findings about the interacting components of egocentric and allocentric processing of human navigation. © 2015.",,"O'Keefe, J., Nadel, L., (1978) The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map, , Clarendon Press, Oxford; Scoville, W.B., Milner, B., Loss of recent memory after bilateral hippocampal lesions (1957) J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry, 20, pp. 11-21; Beddington, J., Cooper, C.L., Field, J., Goswami, U., Huppert, F.A., Jenkins, R., Jones, H.S., Thomas, S.M., The mental wealth of nations (2008) Nature, 455, pp. 1057-1060; McGaugh, J.L., Roozendaal, B., Drug enhancement of memory consolidation: historical perspective and neurobiological implications (2009) Psychopharmacology (Berlin), 202, pp. 3-14; Lee, Y.-S., Silva, A.J., The molecular and cell-biology of enhanced cognition (2009) Nat Rev Neurosci, 10, pp. 126-140; Lynch, G., Cox, C.D., Gall, C.M., Pharmacological enhancement of memory or cognition in normal subjects (2014) Front Syst Neurosci, 8, pp. 1-18. , (Article 90); O'Keefe, J., Place units in the hippocampus of the freely moving rat (1976) Exp Neurol, 51, pp. 78-109; Taube, J.S., Muller, R.U., Ranck, J.B., Head-direction cells recorded from the postsubiculum in freely moving rats.

The objective of this study is to understand occupants' lighting-use behavior by investigating the influence of manual and semi-automatic control systems on lighting-use in a single-occupancy office space. 114 participants were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions that varied in available lighting control options in an immersive virtual environment. They were asked to adjust the room's lighting by choosing one of the following lighting control options: (1) manual control system for artificial lights and interior shades; (2) same options as condition 1 and a semi-automatic control system for the shades; (3) same options as condition 1 and a semi-automatic control system for the artificial lights; and (4) same options as condition 1 and semi-automatic control systems for both the artificial lights and shades. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the participants were significantly more likely to use natural light if there was only a semi-automatic control system to control the shades. However, they were not more likely to use natural light if they were given semi-automatic control options for both the artificial lights and shades. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Building performance; Design decision making; Immersive virtual environments; Lighting; Occupant behavior; Occupant-building interactions","(2013) National awareness of energy star, , http://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/uploads/about/old/files/2013%20CEE%20Report_508%20compliant.pdf; Pérez-Lombard, L., Ortiz, J., Pout, C., Areview on buildings energy consumption information (2008) Energy Build, 40, pp. 394-398; Hoes, P., Hensen, J.L.M., Loomans, M.G.L.C., de Vries, B., Bourgeois, D., User behavior in whole building simulation (2009) Energy Build, 41, pp. 295-302; Reinhart, C.F., Lightswitch-2002: a model for manual and automated control of electric lighting and blinds (2004) Sol Energy, 77, pp. 15-28; Rijal, H.B., Tuohy, P., Humphreys, M.A., Nicol, J.F., Samuel, A., Clarke, J., Using results from field surveys to predict the effect of open windows on thermal comfort and energy use in buildings (2007) Energy Build, 39, pp. 823-836; Citherlet, S., Hand, J., Assessing energy, lighting, room acoustics, occupant comfort and environmental impacts performance of building with a single simulation program (2002) Build Environ, 37, pp. 845-856; Yu, Z., Fung, B.C.M., Haghighat, F., Yoshino, H., Morofsky, E., Asystematic procedure to study the influence of occupant behavior on building energy consumption (2011) Energy Build, 43, pp. 1409-1417; Becerik-Gerber, B., Jazizadeh, F., Kavulya, G., Wood, W., Tambe, M., Kwak, J.-Y., Human-building interaction for energy conservation in office buildings (2012) Construction research congress, pp. 1830-1839; Nguyen, T.A., Aiello, M., Energy intelligent buildings based on user activity: a survey (2013) Energy Build, 56, pp. 244-257; (2014) Energy star, , http://www.energystar.gov/ia/news/email/EnergyStarCFSNewsletter_Winter2014.html; Tetlow, R.M., Beaman, C.P., Elmualim, A.A., Couling, K., Simple prompts reduce inadvertent energy consumption from lighting in office buildings (2014) Build Environ, 81, pp. 234-242; Singhvi, V., Krause, A., Guestrin, C., James, H., Garrett, J., Matthews, H.S., Intelligent light control using sensor networks (2005) Proceedings of the 3rd international conference on embedded networked sensor systems, pp. 218-229. , ACM, San Diego, California, USA; Nicol, J.F., Characterising occupant behaviour in buildings: towards a stochastic model of occupant use of windows, lights, blinds, heaters and fans (2001) Proceedings of the seventh international IBPSA conference, Rio, pp. 1073-1078; Moore, T., Carter, D., Slater, A., Long-term patterns of use of occupant controlled office lighting (2003) Light Res Technol, 35, pp. 43-57; Barlow, S., Fiala, D., Occupant comfort in UK offices-how adaptive comfort theories might influence future low energy office refurbishment strategies (2007) Energy Build, 39, pp. 837-846; Mills, E., Global lighting energy savings potential (2002) Light Eng, 10, pp. 5-10; Boyce, P.R., Eklund, N.H., Simpson, S.N., Individual lighting control: task performance, mood, and illuminance (2000) JIllum Eng Soc, 29, pp. 131-142; Galasiu, A.D., Veitch, J.A., Occupant preferences and satisfaction with the luminous environment and control systems in daylit offices: a literature review (2006) Energy Build, 38, pp. 728-742; Fabi, V., Corgnati, S.P., Andersen, R.V., Filippi, M., Olesen, B.W., Effect of occupant behaviour related influencing factors on final energy end uses in buildings (2011) Proceedings of Climamed; Heydarian, A., Carneiro, J.P., Gerber, D., Becerik-Gerber, B., Hayes, T., Wood, W., Immersive virtual environments: experiments on impacting design and human building interaction (2014) Proceedings of the 19th international conference on computer-aided architectural design research in Asia (CAADRIA), p. 9; Chan, C.-S., Weng, C.-H., How real is the sense of presence in a virtual environment?: applying protocol analysis for data collection.

For their inherent explicit and decoupled structure, explicit dynamics finite element formulations appear to be particularly attractive for implementations on hybrid CPU/GPU or pure GPU architectures. The issue of an optimized, double-precision finite element GPU implementation of an explicit dynamics finite element solver for elastic shell problems in small strains and large displacements and rotations, using unstructured meshes, is here addressed. The conceptual difference between a GPU implementation directly adapted from a standard CPU approach and a new optimized formulation, specifically conceived for GPUs, is discussed and comparatively assessed. It is shown that a speedup factor of about 5 can be achieved by an optimized algorithm reformulation and careful memory management. A speedup of more than 40 is achieved with respect of state-of-the art commercial codes running on CPU, obtaining real-time simulations in some cases, on commodity hardware. When a last generation GPU board is used, it is shown that a problem with more than 16 millions degrees of freedom can be solved in just few hours of computing time, opening the way to virtualization approaches for real large scale engineering problems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This is a simple and accurate method to reconstruct objects from point clouds obtained from multiple overlapping views using low-cost sensors. In contrast to other methods that may need several stages that include downsampling, noise filtering and many other tasks, the NG automatically obtains the 3D model of the scanned objects. To demonstrate the validity of our proposal we tested our method with several models and performed a study of the neural network parameterization computing the quality of representation and also comparing results with other neural methods like growing neural gas and Kohonen maps or classical methods like Voxel Grid. We also reconstructed models acquired by low cost sensors that can be used in virtual and augmented reality environments for redesign or manipulation purposes. Since the NG algorithm has a strong computational cost we propose its acceleration. We have redesigned and implemented the NG learning algorithm to fit it onto Graphics Processing Units using CUDA. A speed-up of 180× faster is obtained compared to the sequential CPU version. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Since rendering complex virtual scenes is computationally demanding, we propose four algorithms for efficiently representing HRTFs in subbands, i.e., as an analysis filterbank (FB) followed by a transfer matrix and a synthesis FB. All four algorithms use sparse approximation procedures to minimize the computational complexity while maintaining perceptually relevant HRTF properties. The first two algorithms separately optimize the complexity of the transfer matrix associated to each HRTF for fixed FBs. The other two algorithms jointly optimize the FBs and transfer matrices for complete HRTF sets by two variants. The first variant aims at minimizing the complexity of the transfer matrices, while the second one does it for the FBs. Numerical experiments investigate the latency-complexity trade-off and show that the proposed methods offer significant computational savings when compared with other available approaches. Psychoacoustic localization experiments were modeled and conducted to find a reasonable approximation tolerance so that no significant localization performance degradation was introduced by the subband representation. © 2015 IEEE.","Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs); sound localization; sparse approximation; subband signal processing; virtual acoustics","Møller, H., Sørensen, M.F., Hammershøi, D., Jensen, C.B., Head-related transfer functions of human subjects (1995) J.

Studies examine the impact of 1) different hand loads on shoulder load prediction, 2) potential tool user hand location measurement errors, and 3) tool response to simulated hand location input error. The results of the first study found that predicted shoulder load in response to hand loads from newly created, load specific shoulder load models differed from the original method's base models by an average of 5%-12% within the first 100g of hand loading and 150%-210% for 1000g hand loads, depending on the population percentile being predicted. In the second study, average hand location measurement error of participants was within 1cm of the desired referent value measured from either a virtual or physical workstation. Results in study three showed that the impact of simulated hand location measurement error on average shoulder load and movement time prediction was low (<0.05Nm and <3.6ms) and demonstrated the potential to cancel out individual task error over a number of work tasks. Combining the user input error results with the simulated error outputs demonstrated that the impact of human error is relatively low. Within parameters similar to these studies the tool should work well in the design-stage assessment of seated, light assembly workstations. Relevance to industry: This testing of a tool for predicting task time and shoulder loading from layout information in the design-stage of seated, light assembly workstations has shown acceptable performance for light assembly hand loads up to 100g with an anticipated input error under 1cm and low output errors for estimated shoulder load and movement time. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Error testing; Human factors; Light assembly; Shoulder load; Workstation assessment; Workstation design","(2001) Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices for 2001, , ACGIH, Cincinnati, OH; Bernard, M.D., (1997) Musculoskeletal Disorders and Workplace Factors: a Critical Review of the Epidemiologic Evidence for Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders of the Neck, Upper Extremity, and Low Back, pp. 97-141. , US Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cinncinnati, OH; Broberg, O., Integrating ergonomics into engineering: empirical evidence and implications for the ergonomists (2007) Hum.

In our approach, depth-map consists of compact objects, each object is represented through three different aspects: 1) the perimeter in image space; 2) the slanted object depth plane; and 3) the planar bias, which is to add an additional level of detail on top of each object plane in order to model depth variations within an object. Compared with traditional high quality solving methods in low level, we use a convex formulation of the multilabel Potts Model with PatchMatch stereo techniques to generate depth-map at each image in object level and show that accurate multiple view reconstruction can be achieved with our formulation by means of induced homography without discretization or staircasing artifacts. Our model is formulated as an energy minimization that is optimized via a fast primal-dual algorithm, which can handle several hundred object depth segments efficiently. Performance evaluations in the Middlebury benchmark data sets show that our method outperforms the traditional integer-valued disparity strategy as well as the original PatchMatch algorithm and its variants in subpixel accurate disparity estimation.

To overcome its defects, this paper improves the detection performance of NSA and presents a kind of bidirectional inhibition optimization r-variable negative selection algorithm (BIORV-NSA). The proposed algorithm includes self set edge inhibition strategy and detector self-inhibition strategy. Self set edge inhibition strategy defines a generalized radius for self individual area, making self individual radius dynamically be variable. To a certain extent, the critical antigens close to self individual area are recognized and more non-self space is covered. Detector self-inhibition strategy, aiming at mutual cross-coverage among mature detectors, eliminates those detectors that are recognized by other mature detectors and avoids the production of excessive invalid detectors. Experiments on artificially generating data set and two standard real-world data sets from UCI are made to verify the performance of BIORV-NSA, by comparison with NSA and R-NSA, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BIORV-NSA algorithm can cover more non-self space, greatly improve the detection rates and obtain better detection performance by using fewer mature detectors. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Using 21 adults with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and 24 adults with no disorder, this study had three objectives: (a) to determine whether speaking to a virtual audience elicited significant increases in physiological response (e.g., heart rate, electrodermal activity, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia) and subjective distress over baseline resting conditions (b) to determine if individuals with SAD had a greater increase in physiological arousal and subjective distress when speaking in front of a live audience vs. the virtual environment and (c) to determine whether individuals with SAD had greater changes in physiological and self-reported arousal during each speech task compared to controls. All participants gave an impromptu speech in front of an in vivo and VR audience while measures of physiological arousal and self-reported distress were obtained. Results demonstrated that the VR task elicited significant increases in heart rate, electrodermal activity, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and self-reported distress over baseline conditions but was less anxiety-producing than the in vivo speech task. In addition, participants reported a moderate level of presence in the VR task, but significantly less than in the in vivo task. No group differences were found on physiological measures. Clinical implications of these findings and the role of VR in the treatment of SAD are discussed. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Exposure therapy; Physiological arousal; Public speaking; Social anxiety disorder; Subjective distress; Virtual reality","Anderson, P., Rothbaum, B.O., Hodges, L.F., Virtual reality exposure in the treatment of social anxiety (2003) Cognitive and Behavioral Practice, 10 (3), pp. 240-247; Anderson, P.L., Zimand, E., Hodges, L.F., Rothbaum, B.O., Cognitive behavioral therapy for public-speaking anxiety using virtual reality for exposure (2005) Depression and Anxiety, 22 (3), pp. 156-158. , PID: 16231290; Beidel, D.C., Turner, S.M., Dancu, C.V., Physiological, cognitive and behavioral aspects of social anxiety (1985) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 23 (2), pp. 109-117. , PID: 4004691; Beidel, D.C., Borden, J.W., Turner, S.M., Jacob, R.G., The social phobia and anxiety inventory: concurrent validity with a clinic sample (1989) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 27 (5), pp. 573-576. , PID: 2818419; Beidel, D.C., Rao, P.A., Scharfstein, L., Wong, N., Alfano, C.A., Social skills and social phobia: an investigation of DSM-IV subtypes (2010) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 48 (10), pp. 992-1001. , PID: 20637452; Berntson, G.G., Quigley, K.S., Lozano, D., Cardiovascular psychophysiology (2007) Handbook of psychophysiology, pp. 182-210. , Cacioppo JT, Tassinary LG, Berntson GG, (eds), Cambridge University Press, New York; Brown, T.A., Di Nardo, P.A., Barlow, D.H., (1994) Anxiety disorders interview schedule for DSM-IV, , Adult version: Oxford University Press; Craske, M.G., Kircanski, K., Zelikowsky, M., Mystkowski, J., Chowdhury, N., Baker, A., Optimizing inhibitory learning during exposure therapy (2008) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 46 (1), pp. 5-27. , PID: 18005936; Foa, E.B., Kozak, M.J., Emotional processing of fear: exposure to corrective information (1986) Psychological Bulletin, 99 (1), pp. 20-35. , PID: 2871574; Garcia-Palacios, A., Botella, C., Hoffman, H., Fabregat, S., Comparing acceptance and refusal rates of virtual reality exposure vs. in vivo exposure by patients with specific phobias (2007) CyberPsychology and Behavior, 10 (5), pp. 722-724. , PID: 17927544; Hamilton, M., A rating scale for depression (1960) Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, 23 (1), p. 56. , PID: 14399272; Harris, S.R., Kemmerling, R.L., North, M.M., Brief virtual reality therapy for public speaking anxiety (2002) Cyber Psychology and Behavior, 5 (6), pp. 543-550; Hartanto, D., Kampmann, I.L., Morina, N., Emmelkamp, P.G., Neerincx, M.A., Brinkman, W.-P., Controlling social stress in virtual reality environments (2014) PLoS ONE, 9 (3), p. 92804. , PID: 24671006; Heimberg, R.G., Horner, K.J., Juster, H.R., Safren, S.A., Brown, E.J., Schneier, F.R., Liebowitz, M.R., Psychometric properties of the Liebowitz social anxiety scale (1999) Psychological Medicine, 29, pp. 199-212. , PID: 10077308; Hofmann, S.G., Dibartolo, P.M., An instrument to assess self-statements during public speaking: scale development and preliminary psychometric properties (2000) Behaviour Therapy, 31, pp. 499-515; Klinger, E., Bouchard, S., Légeron, P., Roy, S., Lauer, F., Chemin, I., Nugues, P., Virtual reality therapy versus cognitive behavior therapy for social phobia: a preliminary controlled study (2005) Cyber Psychology and Behavior, 8 (1), pp. 76-88; Kotlyar, M., Donahue, C., Thuras, P., Kushner, M.G., O’Gorman, N., Smith, E.A., Adson, D.E., Physiological response to a speech stressor presented in a virtual reality environment (2008) Psychophysiology, 45 (6), pp. 1034-1037. , PID: 18778321; Krijn, M., Emmelkamp, P., Olafsson, R.P., Biemond, R., Virtual reality exposure therapy of anxiety disorders: a review (2004) Clinical Psychology Review, 24 (3), pp. 259-281. , PID: 15245832; Lee, K.M., Presence, explicated (2004) Communication Theory, 14 (1), pp. 27-50; Liebowitz, M.R., Social phobia (1987) Modern Problems of Pharmacopsychiatry, 22, pp. 141-173. , PID: 2885745; Liebowitz, M.R., Gorman, J.M., Fyer, A.J., Klein, D.F., Social phobia.

The use of virtual reality (VR) training has the potential to reduce these costs. This research compares virtual bimanual haptic training versus traditional physical training and the effectiveness for learning transfer. In a mixed experimental design, participants were assigned to either virtual or physical training and trained by assembling a wooden burr puzzle as many times as possible during a twenty minute time period. After training, participants were tested using the physical puzzle and were retested again after two weeks. All participants were trained using brightly colored puzzle pieces. To examine the effect of color, testing involved the assembly of colored physical parts and natural wood colored physical pieces. Spatial ability as measured using a mental rotation test, was shown to correlate with the number of assemblies they were able to complete in the training. While physical training outperformed virtual training, after two weeks the virtually trained participants actually improved their test assembly times. The results suggest that the color of the puzzle pieces helped the virtually trained participants in remembering the assembly process. © 2015 IEEE.","assembly; Haptics; Learning transfer; training; virtual reality","Bailey, C., Forgetting and the learning curve: A laboratory study (1989) Manag.

The reconstruction of a realistic virtual actor has been paid attention by the academic research and the film industry to generate human-like virtual actors. Many movies were acted by human-like virtual actors, where the audience cannot distinguish between real and virtual actors. The synthesis of realistic virtual actors is considered a complex process. Many techniques are used to generate a realistic virtual actor; however they usually require expensive hardware equipment. In this paper, a low-cost system that generates near-realistic virtual actors is presented. The facial features of the real actor are blended with a virtual head that is attached to the actor’s body. Comparing with other techniques that generate virtual actors, the proposed system is considered a low-cost system that requires only one camera that records the scene without using any expensive hardware equipment. The results of our system show that the system generates good near-realistic virtual actors that can be used on many applications.Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2015, 3D Research Center, Kwangwoon University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Computer animation; Digital face; Facial animation; Virtual actor","Magnenat-Thalmann, N., Thalmann, D., (2005) Handbook of virtual humans, , Wiley, Hoboken; Kurtz, L.A., Digital actors and copyright-from the polar express to simone (2005) Santa Clara Computer and High Technology Law Journal, 21, p. 783; Jőrg, S., (2011) Perception of body and hand animations for realistic virtual characters, , PhD thesis: Trinity College Dubli; Debevec, P., (2012) The light stages and their applications to photoreal digital actors, , SIGGRAPH Asia Technical Briefs, Singapore; Parke, F.I., Computer generated animation of faces (1972) In Proceedings of the ACM annual conference, 1, pp. 451-457; Alexander, O., Rogers, M., Lambeth, W., Chiang, J.-Y., Ma, W.-C., Wang, C.-C., Debevec, P., The digital emily project: Achieving a photorealistic digital actor (2010) Computer Graphics and Applications, 30 (4), pp. 20-31; Mori, M., MacDorman, K.F., Kageki, N., The uncanny valley [from the field] (2012) IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine, 19 (2), pp. 98-100; Geller, T., Overcoming the uncanny valley (2008) IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, 28 (4), pp. 11-17; Debevec, P., Hawkins, T., Tchou, C., Duiker, H.-P., Sarokin, W., Sagar, M., Acquiring the reflectance field of a human face (2000) In Proceedings of the 27th annual conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques, pp. 145-156; Robertson, B., What’s old is new again (2009) Computer Graphics World; Cosker, D., Eisert, P., Grau, O., Hancock, P.J.B., McKinnell, J., Ong, E.-J., Applications of face analysis and modeling in media production (2013) MultiMedia IEEE, 20 (4), pp. 18-27; Alexander, O., Fyffe, G., Busch, J., Yu, X., Ichikari, R., Jones, A., Debevec, P., Antionazzi, B., Digital ira: Creating a real-time photoreal digital actor (2013) ACM SIGGRAPH 2013 Posters, p. 1; Bhat, K.S., Goldenthal, R., Ye, Y., Mallet, R., Koperwas, M., High fidelity facial animation capture and retargeting with contours (2013) In Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGGRAPH/eurographics symposium on computer animation, pp. 7-14; Afifi, M., Hussain, K.F., Ibrahim, H.M., Omar, N.M., Fast video completion using patch-based synthesis and image registration (2014) In IEEE international symposium on intelligent signal processing and communication systems (ISPACS), pp. 2000-2004; Pérez, P., Gangnet, M., Blake, A., Poisson image editing (2003) ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 22, pp. 313-318; Liu, Z., Zhang, Z., Jacobs, C., Cohen, M., Rapid modeling of animated faces from video (2001) The Journal of Visualization and Computer Animation, 12 (4), pp. 227-240; Wang, C., Yan, S., Zhang, H., & Ma, W.

Multi-server architecture has been shown to have good scalability to support a large population of users in DVEs. In thezone-based Multi-server Distributed Virtual Environment (MSDVE), zone mapping and client assignment are two key issues in the design of an efficient and scalable MSDVE. Most of the existing work on the zone mapping and client assignment issues in MSDVE aims to either balance workload among servers, reduce inter-server communication, and/or reduce transmission delay. In this paper, we study the zone mapping and client assignment issues from a new perspective aiming to reduce the inconsistency of a DVE. Using the time-space inconsistency metric, we formally formulate the problem as a mix integer programming problem. The zone mapping and client assignment strategy is proposed which consists of a centralized algorithm for initialization and a distributed adaptive tuningalgorithm for running system. Extensive experiments were conducted both by simulation and real system for evaluating theperformance of the proposed solutions and results are reported in the paper. © 1990-2012 IEEE.","alternating optimization; Distributed virtual environment; Multi-server architecture; partitioning; time-space consistency","(2013) Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, , United States, Blizzard Entertainment, Irvine, CA, USA; Allen, P.D., Demchak, C.C., Applied virtual environments: Applications of virtual environments to government, military and business organizations (2011) J.

The aim of BPA is uncovering new information about the actions that took place in a crime scene, potentially leading to a confirmation or refutation of a suspect's statement. A typical goal of BPA is to estimate the flight paths for a set of stains, followed by a directional analysis in order to estimate the area of origin for the stains. The traditional approach, referred to as stringing, consists of attaching a piece of string to each stain, and letting the string represent an approximation of the stain's flight path. Even though stringing has been used extensively, many (practical) downsides exist. We propose an automated and virtual approach, employing fiducial markers and digital images. By automatically reconstructing a single coordinate frame from several images, limited user input is required. Synthetic crime scenes were created and analysed in order to evaluate the approach. Results demonstrate the correct operation and practical advantages, suggesting that the proposed approach may become a valuable asset for practically analysing bloodstain spatter patterns. Accompanying software called HemoVision is currently provided as a demonstrator and will be further developed for practical use in forensic investigations. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Automated; Bloodstain pattern analysis; HemoVision; Virtual","Carter, A.L., The directional analysis of bloodstain patterns theory and experimental validation (2001) Can.

Mainly due to this, each VM running on the NUMA system will have irregular data access performance at different times. Because existing hypervisors, such as KVM, VMware, and Xen, have yet to consider this, users of VMs cannot predict their data access performance or even recognize the data access performance they have experienced. In this paper, we propose a novel VM placement technique to resolve this issue pertaining to irregular data access performance of VMs running on the NUMA system. The hypervisor with our technique provides the illusion of a private memory subsystem to each VM, which guarantees the data access latency required by each VM on average. To enable this feature, we periodically evaluates the average data access latency of each VM using hardware performance monitoring units. After every evaluation, our Mcredit-based VM migration algorithm tries to migrate the VCPU or memory of the VM not meeting with its required data access latency to another node, giving the VM less data access latency. We implemented the prototype for KVM hypervisor on Linux 3.10.10. Experimental results show that, in the four-node NUMA system, our technique keeps the required data access performance levels of VMs running various workloads while it only consumes less than 1 percent of the cycles of a core and 0.3 percent of the system memory bandwidth. © 2014 IEEE.

To tackle this problem, we propose a multiple information fusion-based multiple hypotheses tracking algorithm integrated with appearance feature, local motion pattern feature and repulsion–inertia model for multi-object tracking. Appearance model based on HSV–local binary patterns histogram and local motion pattern based on optical flow are adopted to describe objects. A likelihood calculation framework is proposed to incorporate the similarities of appearance, dynamic process and local motion pattern. To consider the changes in appearance and motion pattern over time, we make use of an effective template updating strategy for each object. In addition, a repulsion–inertia model is adopted to explore more useful information from ambiguous detections. Experimental results show that the proposed approach generates better trajectories with less missing objects and identity switches. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Data association; MHT; Multi-object tracking; Multiple information fusion","Hofmann, M., Rigoll, G., Huang, T., Dense spatio-temporal motion segmentation for tracking multiple self-occluding people (2010) 2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), pp. 9-14; Zhang, T., Liu, J., Liu, S., Ouyang, Y., Lu, H.: Boosted exemplar learning for human action recognition.

In order to achieve precise attitude reconstruction, appropriate sensor calibration procedures must be performed in advance to process sensor readings properly. In this paper, we are aiming to calibrate different error parameters, such as sensor sensitivity/scale factor error, offset/bias error, nonorthogonality error, mounting error, and also soft iron and hard iron errors for magnetometers. Instead of estimating all of these parameters individually, these errors are combined together as the combined bias and transformation matrix. Two-step approaches are proposed to determine the combined bias and transformation matrix separately. For the accelerometer and magnetometer, the combined bias is determined by finding an optimal ellipsoid that can best fit the sensor readings, and the transformation matrix is then derived through a two-step iterative algorithm by exploring the intrinsic relationship among sensor readings. For the gyroscope, the combined bias can be easily determined by placing the sensor node stationary. For the transformation matrix estimation, the intrinsic relationship among gyroscope readings is explored again, and an unscented Kalman filter is employed to determine such matrix. The calibration methods are then applied to our sensor nodes, and the good performance of the orientation estimation has illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed sensor calibration methods. © 2014 IEEE.

However, there is a lack of research on veteran preferences when presented with a range of psychotherapy and medication options. This study uses a mixed-method approach to explore veteran satisfaction with a VA PTSD specialty clinic pre-treatment orientation group, which provides education about available PTSD treatment options. This study also tested differences in treatment preference in response to the group. Participants were 183 US veterans. Most were White, male, and referred to the clinic by a VA provider. Results indicated high satisfaction with the group in providing an overview of services and helping to inform treatment choice. Most preferred psychotherapy plus medications (63.4%) or psychotherapy only (30.1%). Participants endorsed a significantly stronger preference for CPT versus other psychotherapies. PE was significantly preferred over nightmare resolution therapy and present-centered therapy, and both PE and cognitive-behavioral conjoint therapy were preferred over virtual reality exposure therapy. Results suggest that by informing consumers about evidence-based treatments for PTSD, pre-treatment educational approaches may increase consumer demand for these treatment options. © 2015.","Choice; Medication; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Psychotherapy; Veterans","Angelo, F.N., Miller, H.E., Zoellner, L.A., Feeny, N.C., ""I need to talk about it"": a qualitative analysis of trauma-exposed women's reasons for treatment choice (2008) Behavior Therapy, 39, pp. 13-21; Barlow, D.H., Psychological treatments (2004) American Psychologist, 59, pp. 869-878; Becker, C.B., Darius, E., Schaumberg, K., An analog study of patient preferences for exposure versus alternative treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (2007) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 45, pp. 2861-2873; Bernardy, N., Davis, N., Howard, J., Key, F., Lambert, J., Shea, M.T., (2008) Present-centered therapy manual, , (Unpublished therapy manual); Cahill, S.P., Rothbaum, B.O., Resick, P.A., Follette, V.M., Cognitive-behavioral therapy for adults (2009) Effective treatments for PTSD: Practice guidelines from the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies, pp. 139-222. , Guilford, New York, E.B.

The problem has important societal applications such as land cover classification for natural resource management. However, the problem is challenging due to the fact that learning samples show spatial autocorrelation in class labels, instead of being independently identically distributed. Related work relies on local tests (i.e., testing feature information of a location) and cannot adequately model the spatial autocorrelation effect, resulting in salt-and-pepper noise. In contrast, we recently proposed a focal-test-based spatial decision tree (FTSDT), in which the tree traversal direction of a sample is based on both local and focal (neighborhood) information. Preliminary results showed that FTSDT reduces classification errors and salt-and-pepper noise. This paper extends our recent work by introducing a new focal test approach with adaptive neighborhoods that avoids over-smoothing in wedge-shaped areas. We also conduct computational refinement on the FTSDT training algorithm by reusing focal values across candidate thresholds. Theoretical analysis shows that the refined training algorithm is correct and more scalable. Experiment results on real world data sets show that new FTSDT with adaptive neighborhoods improves classification accuracy, and that our computational refinement significantly reduces training time. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","focal-test-based spatial decision tree; land cover classification; spatial autocorrelation; spatial data mining","Quinlan, J.R., (1993) C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning, , San Mateo, CA, USA: Morgan Kaufmann; Jiang, Z., Shekhar, S., Mohan, P., Knight, J., Corcoran, J., Learning spatial decision tree for geographical classification: A summary of results (2012) Proc. 20th Int.

The analysis can be done by using properly designed automatic techniques for a quantitative, objective, and reliable extraction of information from radargrams. Unfortunately, the definition and development of such automatic techniques have only been marginally addressed in the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient system for the automatic classification of ice subsurface targets present in radargrams. The core of the system is represented by the extraction of a set of features for target discrimination. The features are based on both the specific statistical properties of the RS signal and the spatial distribution of the ice subsurface targets. Such features are then provided as input to an automatic classifier based on support vector machine. Experimental results obtained on two real-world data sets acquired by airborne-mounted RSs in large regions of Antarctica confirm the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed classification system. © 2015 IEEE.","Cryosphere; ice subsurface targets; radar sounding; remote sensing; signal processing; subsurface analysis","Bogorodsky, V., Bentley, C., Gudmandsen, P., (1984) Radioglaciology, , Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Reidel; Matsuoka, K., Macgregor, J., Pattyn, F., Predicting radar attenuation within the Antarctic ice sheet (2012) Earth Planetary Sci.

Diamond-like carbon film has been commonly used for capping layer due to its high mechanical hardness and easiness for tailoring physical properties. However, the possibility for such carbon thin film to react to surrounding oxygen when subjected to Joule heating during the recording process of phasechange probe memory is rarely investigated before from both experimental and simulation point of view. Therefore, a novel carbon oxidation model was developed to mimic the chemical reaction of carbon film to the surrounding oxygen in terms of the degradation of layer thickness. Results obtained from this model are in a good agreement with the experimental counterpart, indicating the physical reality of this proposed model. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers.","Capping layer; Diamond like carbon; Oxidation; Phase-Change probe memory","Gantz, J., Reinsel, D., (2012) IDC Tech Report, 1; Parekh, K., Almasy, L., Lee, H.S., Upadhyay, R.V., (2004) Appl.

A data set of 440 organic chemicals, 143 with antitrypanosomal activity and 297 having other clinical uses, is used to develop the theoretical models. Two discriminant models, computed using bondbased bilinear indices, are developed and both show accuracies higher than 86% for training and test sets. The stochastic model correctly indentifies nine out of eleven compounds of a set of organic chemicals obtained from our synthetic collaborators. The in vitro antitrypanosomal activity of this set against epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi is assayed. Both models show a good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results. Three compounds showed IC<inf>50</inf> values for epimastigote elimination (AE) lower than 50 μM, while for the benznidazole the IC<inf>50</inf> = 54.7 μM which was used as reference compound. The value of IC<inf>50</inf> for cytotoxicity of these compounds is at least 5 times greater than their value of IC<inf>50</inf> for AE. Finally, we can say that, the present algorithm constitutes a step forward in the search for efficient ways of discovering new antitrypanosomal compounds. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Bond-based bilinear indices; In vitro cytotoxicity; LDA-assisted QSAR model; Trypanosomicidal; Virtual screening","Aufderheide, A.C., Salo, W., Madden, M., Streitz, J., Buikstra, J., Guhl, F., Arriaza, B., Allison, M., A 9,000-year record of Chagas' disease (2004) Proc.

Partial interval recording sampling was used to code social interactions (Socio-Spatial Interactivity and Social Presence) that occurred between experienced World of Warcraft players during their game play. Given the bidirectional nature of social interactions, Socio-Spatial Interactivity and Social Presence variables (Affective Association, Community Cohesion, Interaction Intensity, and Knowledge & Experience) were employed as both dependent and independent variables in two separate sets of regression analyses. Findings suggest that a positive feedback loop exists between Socio-Spatial Interactivity and Social Presence. Based on these findings, the researchers discuss implications for designers and end-users of virtual environments. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Eleven children (mean age 8.09 years) and ten adults participated in the study. Each participant played two digital games, Slap Stream and Kung Foo, from EyeToy Play software. Eye movements were recorded using Mobile Eye eyetracker. Eye-hand coordination strategies and the time when virtual object appeared, the gaze shifted to the object, the reach started, the gaze shifted away, and the reach ended were coded from the video. The latencies between these events were computed and compared between adults and children and between games. The fixation duration, number of fixations, and number of gaze points were also computed for each game's areas of interests. Results showed that (1) all participants used multiple eye-hand strategies while playing active video games with some strategies more than others; (2) the Kung Foo game (with one target appearing on the screen) and the Slap Stream game (with potentially multiple targets appearing on the screen) induced different latencies and gaze points between children and adults; and (3) children had longer latencies and shorter fixation durations than adults. The study thus provides in-depth understanding of different patterns of eye-hand coordination in relations to active video game playing. The significant differences in coordinative control strategies found between adults and children as well as between game types provide a basis for further research in both child development and game-based learning fields. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Robotic suturing skills were evaluated before and after training using an inanimate vaginal cuff model, which participants sutured for 10 min using the da Vinci® Surgical System. Performances were videotaped, anonymized, and subsequently graded independently by three robotic surgeons. 27 participants were randomized. 23 of the 27 completed both the pre- and post-test, 13 in the training group and 10 in the control group. Mean training time in the intervention group was 238 ± 136 min (SD) over the 5 weeks. The primary outcome (improvement in GOALS+ score) and the secondary outcomes (improvement in GEARS, total knots, satisfactory knots, and the virtual reality suture sponge 1 task) were significantly greater in the training group than the control group in unadjusted analysis. After adjusting for lower baseline scores in the training group, improvement in the suture sponge 1 task remained significantly greater in the training group and a trend was demonstrated to greater improvement in the training group for the GOALS+ score, GEARS score, total knots, and satisfactory knots. © 2015 Springer-Verlag London","Computer simulation; Graduate medical education; Operative surgical procedures; Patient simulation; Randomized controlled trial; Robotics",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929439782

Jornalista Aníbal Fernandes, s/n, Recife (PE), Brazil","Fuzzy clustering has become an important research field with many applications to real world problems. Among fuzzy clustering methods, fuzzy c-means (FCM) is one of the best known for its simplicity and efficiency, although it shows some weaknesses, particularly its tendency to fall into local minima. To tackle this shortcoming, many optimization-based fuzzy clustering methods have been proposed in the literature. Some of these methods are based solely on a metaheuristic optimization, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) whereas others are hybrid methods that combine a metaheuristic with a traditional partitional clustering method such as FCM. It is demonstrated in the literature that methods that hybridize PSO and FCM for clustering have an improved accuracy over traditional partitional clustering approaches. On the other hand, PSO-based clustering methods have poor execution time in comparison to partitional clustering techniques. Another problem with PSO-based clustering is that the current PSO algorithms require tuning a range of parameters before they are able to find good solutions. In this paper we introduce two hybrid methods for fuzzy clustering that aim to deal with these shortcomings. The methods, referred to as FCM-IDPSO and FCM2-IDPSO, combine FCM with a recent version of PSO, the IDPSO, which adjusts PSO parameters dynamically during execution, aiming to provide better balance between exploration and exploitation, avoiding falling into local minima quickly and thereby obtaining better solutions. Experiments using two synthetic data sets and eight real-world data sets are reported and discussed. The experiments considered the proposed methods as well as some recent PSO-based fuzzy clustering methods.

A distinctive set of communication skills is needed by people who work successfully in virtual teams, and few universities or companies provide structured education and training in virtual teamwork. At a midsized southeastern Masters Comprehensive University, professors from the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business, and Education came together to explore how they might use cross-disciplinary student teams (groups comprised of students with different backgrounds and educational goals) to teach concepts in their own disciplines while providing students with the opportunity to become more proficient in virtual team communication. Research questions: (1) Can cross-disciplinary student team projects successfully support learning in virtual team communication as well as address the learning objectives of specific courses? (2) What can faculty learn from a cross-disciplinary teaching model that can be applied to virtual teams? Situating the case: Experiential learning is based on performing real tasks and reflecting on that process; it benefits learners by engaging them in complex, authentic situations. Virtual teams are significant because they support a great deal of the work currently taking place in our global economy; they are significant in higher education because students need to develop skills in international virtual communication before they are introduced to high-stakes work environments. In previous cases, students have collaborated across national cultures to develop project deliverables, such as websites, reports, and usability studies and present them in virtual environments using such tools as WebEx, Skype, and live streaming. How this case was studied: The findings from this case are based on individual student reflections, which were used to create a data matrix for each project, and instructor observation and evaluation. In Spring 2013, six faculty from the same university worked together to incorporate virtual teams into their classrooms. These six faculty members were divided into two groups of three with each group representing three colleges mentioned earlier. The faculty developed two interdisciplinary projects (one on infographics and another on social media) that enabled rich and diverse student collaboration. In both groups, the three faculty leaders worked together to define a project scope that students could achieve and that would relate to learning goals in each discipline. The lessons learned from this experience are that: (1) technical challenges will occur; (2) students from all disciplines must receive the same information; (3) instructors must balance respect for their colleagues and support for their students; (4) team assignments need to be consistent and fair; (5) instructors need to establish appropriate and fair assessment measurements for their own students; and (6) projects need to be realistic in order to show the students the value of virtual work.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929601026

Different clothing sizes are tested to fit onto a human body to assure satisfactory fit. Several test subjects were recruited in this study. Representations of several different sized clothing were compared between an actual human body (RB) and virtual model (VM) to evaluate the virtual try-on clothing fit. The clothing fit of specified sizes was evaluated quantitatively by calculating the vacant space area between the clothes and human body. The vacant space measure is used to perform real and virtual body fit evaluations. The clothing fit information obtained in this study can be applied to the development of clothing products in the apparel industry. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Fit evaluation; Real body; Vacant space area; Virtual model; Virtual try-on; Visual analysis",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929430655

In this paper, a feature selection method is proposed by combining the popular transformation-based dimensionality reduction method linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and sparsity regularization. We impose row sparsity on the transformation matrix of LDA through ℓ₂₁-norm regularization to achieve feature selection, and the resultant formulation optimizes for selecting the most discriminative features and removing the redundant ones simultaneously. The formulation is extended to the ℓ₂,p-norm regularized case, which is more likely to offer better sparsity when 0 < p < 1. Thus, the formulation is a better approximation to the feature selection problem. An efficient algorithm is developed to solve the ℓ₂,p-norm-based optimization problem and it is proved that the algorithm converges when 0 < p ≤ 2. Systematical experiments are conducted to understand the work of the proposed method. Promising experimental results on various types of real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929591297

In mammalian brains, head direction cells integrate these two streams of information by representing an animal's heading relative to landmarks, yet maintaining their directional tuning in darkness based on self-motion cues. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed Drosophila melanogaster walking on a ball in a virtual reality arena to demonstrate that landmark-based orientation and angular path integration are combined in the population responses of neurons whose dendrites tile the ellipsoid body, a toroidal structure in the centre of the fly brain. The neural population encodes the fly's azimuth relative to its environment, tracking visual landmarks when available and relying on self-motion cues in darkness. When both visual and self-motion cues are absent, a representation of the animal's orientation is maintained in this network through persistent activity, a potential substrate for short-term memory. Several features of the population dynamics of these neurons and their circular anatomical arrangement are suggestive of ring attractors, network structures that have been proposed to support the function of navigational brain circuits. ©2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In the present study, we used virtual reality to enhance the effects of covert sensitization. The aim was to verify the effectiveness of virtual covert sensitization treatment in reducing heavy social drinkers’ alcohol craving. The explicit and implicit measurements included a self-report questionnaire, alcohol-Implicit Association Test, eye-tracking test, and alcohol-Stroop test. To determine the baseline, we measured the alcohol craving in heavy social drinkers (N = 20) and light drinkers (N = 20). Furthermore, virtual covert sensitization treatment was administered to each participant for 10 min. Afterward, the same measurements as at baseline were repeated. Despite the one-time nature of the administered treatment, our results confirm the effectiveness of virtual covert sensitization based on the participants’ changed implicit craving and explicit, self-reported craving. Therefore, virtual covert sensitization may be an effective intervention technique for alcohol addiction treatment. © 2015 Springer-Verlag London","Alcohol craving; Covert sensitization; Eye movement; Implicit cognition; Virtual reality",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929439539

A long-standing challenge in network virtualization is how to effectively map these virtual networks onto the shared substrate network, known as the virtual network embedding (VNE) problem. Most heuristic VNE algorithms find practical solutions by leveraging a greedy matching strategy in node mapping. However, greedy node mapping may lead to unnecessary bandwidth consumption and increased network fragmentation because it ignores the relationships between the mapped virtual network requests and the mapping ones. In this paper, we re-visit the VNE problem from a statistical perspective and explore the potential dependencies between every two substrate nodes. We define a well-designed dependency matrix that represents the importance of substrate nodes and the topological relationships between them, i.e., every substrate node’s degree of belief. Based on the dependency matrix generated from collecting and processing records of accepted virtual network requests, Bayesian inference is leveraged to iteratively select the most suitable substrate nodes and realize our novel statistical VNE algorithm consisting of a learning stage and an inference stage in node mapping. Due to the overall consideration of the relationships between the mapped nodes and the mapping ones, our statistical approach reduces unnecessary bandwidth consumption and achieves a better performance of embedding. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our algorithm significantly improves the long-term average revenue, acceptance ratio, and revenue/cost ratio compared to previous algorithms. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Bayesian inference; Dependency matrix; Network virtualization; Statistics; Virtual network embedding",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929441421

The algorithm operates on a difference image, which is created by using a novel fusion algorithm on multitemporal multispectral images, by iteratively minimizing a cost function with PBPSO to produce a final binary change-detection mask representing changed and unchanged pixels. Each BPSO of parallel instances is run on a separate processor and initialized with a different starting population representing a set of change-detection masks. A communication strategy is applied to transmit data in between BPSOs running in parallel. The algorithm takes the full advantage of parallel processing to improve both the convergence rate and detection performance. We demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method by quantitative and qualitative tests on semisynthetic and real-world data sets. The semisynthetic results for different levels of Gaussian noise are obtained in terms of false and miss alarm (MA) rates between the estimated change-detection mask and the ground truth image. The proposed method on the semisynthetic data with high level of Gaussian noise obtains the final change-detection mask with a false error rate of 1.50 and MA error rate of 14.51.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929208295

Elliptical guides are capable of transporting an almost completely filled phase space within a large divergence (±2° for cold neutrons). It is therefore possible to place several secondary guides side by side pointing in slightly different directions using the end of a primary guide as a virtual source. The instruments placed at the secondary guides hence exploit different parts of the phase space transported by the primary guide. In addition, the resulting kink between the primary and secondary guide eliminates line of sight. Using ray-tracing simulations of three different set-ups (with two, four, and eight secondary guides) we show that it is possible to illuminate at least eight sample positions from one beam port with a brilliance transfer above 90% on each sample on a 150 m long instrument. This has been done for a phase space volume comprised of an area of 1×1 cm2 and a maximum divergence of±0.5° within a wavelength band of 4.25-5.75 Å. We show, by a full virtual experiment, an example of applying the guide-split concept to an instrument proposed for the European Spallation Source, namely a magnetism diffractometer. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A scoping review was performed to examine the efficacy of VR-based interventions on balance and mobility disorders post stroke. Twenty-four articles in the English language examining VR game-based interventions and outcomes directed at balance and mobility disorders were included. Various VR systems (customized and commercially available) were used as rehabilitation tools. Outcome measures included laboratory and clinical measures of balance and gait. Outcome measures of dynamic balance showed significant improvements following VR-based interventions as compared to other interventions. Further, it was observed that VR-based intervention may have favorable effects in improving walking speed and the ability to deal with environmental challenges, which may also facilitate independent community ambulation. VR-based therapy thus has the potential to be a useful tool for balance and gait training for stroke rehabilitation. Utilization of motor learning principles related to task-related training may have been an important factor leading to positive results. Other principles such as repetition, feedback etc. were used in studies but were not explored explicitly and may need to be investigated to further improve the strength of results. Lastly, robust study designs with appropriate attention towards the intensity and dose-response aspects of VR training, clear study objectives and suitable outcomes would further aid in determining evidence-based efficacy for VR game-based interventions in the future. © 2015 Darekar et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Balance deficits; Cerebrovascular accident; Gait; Gait retraining; Game-based rehabilitation; Physiotherapy; Posture; Rehabilitation; Stroke; Virtual reality",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928974603

Often, it is challenging to accurately reproduce the experimental setups in the numerical environment, thereby leaving uncertainty in the validation process. An experiment on impinging jets was designed with boundary conditions well suited for implementation in the numerical environment. In this work, LES was implemented to specifically match the experiment of a single-pulse jet impinging on a surface oriented normally to the jet axis. The experiment was designed primarily to study the thermal effects on the impingement zone with high space-time resolution. The temperature evolution of the impingement target was measured via IR camera. The space-time resolved jet velocity-field was measured with PIV and was used as boundary condition for the simulation. The focus of the LES was to replicate the experiment as faithfully as possible in the virtual environment. LES was run multiple times to allow statistical evaluation of the results, as done in the experimental procedure. High levels of agreement were found between the LES and the experimental results, both from a qualitative and a quantitative point of view. This work could therefore be considered as a successful validation of the LES in the study of this type of flows. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, whether performance improvements during rehabilitation relate to brain plasticity or whether it is based on functional adaptation of movement strategies remain uncertain. This study assessed training improvement-induced structural brain plasticity in chronic iSCI patients using longitudinal MRI. We used tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to analyze longitudinal brain volume changes associated with intensive virtual reality (VR)-augmented lower limb training in nine traumatic iSCI patients. The MRI data was acquired before and after a 4-week training period (16–20 training sessions). Before training, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and voxel-based cortical thickness (VBCT) assessed baseline morphometric differences in nine iSCI patients compared to 14 healthy controls. The intense VR-augmented training of limb control improved significantly balance, walking speed, ambulation, and muscle strength in patients. Retention of clinical improvements was confirmed by the 3–4 months follow-up. In patients relative to controls, VBM revealed reductions of white matter volume within the brainstem and cerebellum and VBCT showed cortical thinning in the primary motor cortex. Over time, TBM revealed significant improvement-induced volume increases in the left middle temporal and occipital gyrus, left temporal pole and fusiform gyrus, both hippocampi, cerebellum, corpus callosum, and brainstem in iSCI patients. This study demonstrates structural plasticity at the cortical and brainstem level as a consequence of VR-augmented training in iSCI patients. These structural changes may serve as neuroimaging biomarkers of VR-augmented lower limb neurorehabilitation in addition to performance measures to detect improvements in rehabilitative training. © 2015 Villiger,Grabher,Hepp Reymond, Kiper ,Curt,Bolliger,Hotz Boendermaker, Kollias,Engand Freund.","Lower limb; Spinal cord injury; Structural plasticity; Tensor-based morphometry; Virtual reality-augmented neurorehabilitation; Voxel-based morphometry","Adamovich, S.V., Fluet, G.G., Tunik, E., Merians, A.S., Sensorimotor training in virtual reality: A review (2009) NeuroRehabilitation, 25, pp. 29-44; Albouy, G., Sterpenich, V., Balteau, E., Vandewalle, G., Desseilles, M., Dang-Vu, T., Both the hippocampus and striatum are involved in consolidation of motor sequence memory (2008) Neuron, 58, pp. 261-272; Ashburner, J., A fast diffeomorphic image registration algorithm (2007) Neuroimage, 38, pp. 95-113; Ashburner, J., Friston, K.J., Voxel-based morphometry-the methods (2000) Neuroimage, 11, pp. 805-821; Ashburner, J., Friston, K.J., Unified segmentation (2005) Neuroimage, 26, pp. 839-851; Ashburner, J., Ridgway, G.R., Symmetric diffeomorphic modeling of longitudinal structural MRI (2013) Front.

Moreover, a skillful actor is needed for capturing the motion. We introduce a simple but interesting method such that anyone can synthesize an animation of skillful ball-handling motion using interaction patterns without any actual ball. Interaction patterns involve regularly repeated human motions to control the virtual ball. We first capture the motion that mimics controlling a ball using various interaction patterns. Then we synthesize the trajectory of a virtual ball by analyzing the captured motion and correct the character motion to be fitted to the synthesized trajectory of a virtual ball. Experiments convincingly show the usefulness of proposed technique by synthesizing various ball-handling animations. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Interaction motion; Motion analysis; Motion capture; Physics-based animation; Virtual reality",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928717105

This paper analyzes the looping path problem causing error accumulation, and introduces a multi-image stitching method based on graph model. We name the algorithm Weighted Shortest Path Algorithm, by which images can be stitched automatically. Matching Mean Square Error is introduced as the weight of edges on the graph, which is intuitive and easy to compute. Furthermore, the optimized Dijkstra algorithm is applied to speed up the path finding algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm causes less Matching Mean Square Error and obtains more stable results than other similar methods. Moreover, we extended our model to 360 ° panoramic image generation, and the quality of the stitched panorama is quite good. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","360 degree-panoramic image generation; Automatic mosaic; Graph model; Weighted shortest path algorithm",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928730330

This is not always the case, and in situations where data is limited, transfer learning can be applied to compensate for the lack of information by learning from several sources. In this work, we present a novel methodology for inducing a Temporal Nodes Bayesian Network (TNBN) when training data is scarce by applying a transfer learning strategy. A TNBN is a probabilistic graphical model that offers a compact representation for dynamic domains by defining multiple time intervals in which events can occur. Learning a TNBN poses additional challenges to learning traditional Bayesian networks due to the incorporation of time intervals. Our proposal incorporates novel approaches to transfer knowledge from several TNBNs to learn the structure, parameters and intervals of a target TNBN. To evaluate our algorithm, we performed experiments with a synthetic network, where we created auxiliary models by altering the structure, parameters and temporal intervals of the original model. Results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of retrieving a reliable model even when few records are available for the target domain. We also performed experiments with a real-world data set belonging to the medical domain of HIV, where we were able to learn some documented mutational pathways and their temporal relations by applying transfer learning. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Bayesian networks; Knowledge transfer; Temporal reasoning; Transfer learning",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929093483

According to an influential theory, the Interactive Alignment Model, alignment is the result of priming. When people perceive an utterance, the corresponding linguistic representations are primed and become easier to produce. Here we tested this theory by investigating whether pitch (F0) alignment shows two characteristic signatures of priming: dose dependence and persistence. In a virtual reality experiment, we manipulated the pitch of a virtual interlocutor's speech to find out (1) whether participants accommodated to the agent's F0, (2) whether the amount of accommodation increased with increasing exposure to the agent's speech, and (3) whether changes to participants' F0 persisted beyond the conversation. Participants accommodated to the virtual interlocutor, but accommodation did not increase in strength over the conversation and disappeared immediately after the conversation ended. Results argue against a priming-based account of F0 accommodation and indicate that an alternative mechanism is needed to explain alignment along continuous dimensions of language such as speech rate and pitch. 2015 © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928787874

They act through a variety of mechanisms and a majority of them inhibit the nuclear factor kappa-beta (NF-κB) signaling pathway. In this study, we examined the effects of the naturally occurring PTs on IκB kinase-β (IKKβ), which has great scientific relevance in the NF-κB signaling pathway. On virtual screening, 109 PTs were screened through the PASS (prediction of activity spectra of substances) software for prediction of NF-κB inhibitory activity followed by docking on the NEMO/IKKβ association complex (PDB: 3BRV) and testing for compliance with the softened Lipinski's Rule of Five using Schrodinger (LLC, New York, USA). Out of the projected 45 druggable PTs, Corosolic Acid (CA), Asiatic Acid (AA) and Ursolic Acid (UA) were assayed for IKKβ kinase activity in the cell free medium. The UA exhibited a potent IKKβ inhibitory effect on the hotspot kinase assay with IC50 of 69 μM. Whereas, CA at 50 μM concentration markedly reduced the NF-κB luciferase activity and phospho-IKKβ protein expressions. The PTs tested, attenuated the expression of the NF-κB cascade proteins in the LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, prevented the phosphorylation of the IKKα/β and blocked the activation of the Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). The results suggest that the IKKβ inhibition is the major mechanism of the PTs-induced NF-κB inhibition. PASS predictions along with in-silico docking against the NEMO/IKKβ can be successfully applied in the selection of the prospective NF-κB inhibitory downregulators of IKKβ phosphorylation. © 2015 Patil et al.",,"Bonizzi, G., Karin, M., The two NF-κB activation pathways and their role in innate and adaptive immunity (2004) Trends Immunol, 25 (6), pp. 280-288. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2004.03.008, PMID: 15145317; Ghosh, S., May, M.J., Kopp, E.B., NF-κB and Rel proteins: Evolutionary conserved mediators of immune responses (1998) Annu Rev Immunol, 16, pp. 225-260. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.immunol.16.1.225, PMID: 9597130; Li, Q., Verma, I.M., NF-kappaB regulation in the immune system (2002) Nat Rev Immunol, 2 (10), pp. 725-734. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nri910, PMID: 12360211; Hoesel, B., Schmid, J.A., The complexity of NF-κB signaling in inflammation and cancer (2013) Mol Cancer, 12, p. 86. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1476-4598-12-86, PMID: 23915189; Sun, S.C., Chang, J.H., Jin, J., Regulation of nuclear factor-κB in autoimmunity (2013) Trends Immunol, 34 (6), pp. 282-289. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2013.01.004, PMID: 23434408; Gilmore, T.D., Introduction to NF-κB: Players, pathways, perspectives (2006) Oncogene, 25 (51), pp. 6680-6684. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.onc.1209954, PMID: 17072321; Karin, M., How NF-kappaB is activated: The role of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex (1999) Oncogene, 18 (49), pp. 6867-6874. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.onc.1203219, PMID: 10602462; Scheidereit, C., IkappaB kinase complexes: Gateways to NF-kappaB activation and transcription (2006) Oncogene, 25 (51), pp. 6685-6705. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.onc.1209934, PMID: 17072322; Tergaonkar, V., NF-kappaB pathway: A good signaling paradigm and therapeutic target (2006) Int J Biochem Cell Biol, 38 (10), pp. 1647-1653. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2006.03.023, PMID: 16766221; Grover, A., Shandilya, A., Punetha, A., Bisaria, V.S., Sundar, D., Inhibition of the NEMO/IKKβ association complex formation, a novel mechanism associated with the NF-κB activation suppression by Withania somnifera's key metabolite withaferin A (2010) BMC Genomics, 11, p.

Numerous reports indicate that the incidence of PTSD in both returning Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) military personnel and survivors of the 9/11 World Trade Center (WTC) attacks is significant. These situations have served to motivate research on how to better develop and disseminate evidence-based treatments for PTSD and other related psychosocial conditions. Virtual reality (VR) delivered exposure therapy for PTSD is currently being used to treat combat and terrorist attack related PTSD with initial reports of positive outcomes. This paper presents an overview and rationale for the use of VR exposure therapy with anxiety disorders and PTSD and describes the status of two systems (Virtual Iraq/Afghanistan and Virtual World Trade Center) developed for this purpose. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Anxiety disorders; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Prolonged exposure; Virtual reality",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929121508

A 3x3 array actuator, of size 15x15x1 mm3, consists of nine cantilever structured cells of which the pillars are supported and made with cellulose acetate by a molding technique. The fabrication process and performance test along with results for the suggested vibrotactile actuator are explained. To simulate the touch force, the top mass is added on the actuator and the actuator performance is measured under actuation. When 2000 V<inf>p-p</inf> voltage is applied to the actuator, the averaged maximum acceleration for all cells is 0.44α0.19 g, which is above the vibrotactile threshold. The actuation mechanism is associated with the electrostatic force between top and bottom electrodes. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","array miniaturization; cellulose acetate; dielectric constant; film type actuator; vibrotactile actuator","Ernst, M.O., Banks, M.S., Humans integrate visual and haptic information in a statistically optimal fashion (2002) Nature, 415, pp. 429-433; Johnson, K.O., The roles and functions of cutaneous mechanoreceptors (2001) Curr.

In film, motion synthesis can be used to generate difficult or dangerous stunts without putting performers at risk. In computer games and virtual reality, motion synthesis enriches the player or participant experience by allowing for unscripted and emergent character behavior. In each of these applications the ability to adapt to changes to environmental conditions or to the character in a smooth and natural manner, while still conforming with user-specified constraints, determines the utility of a method to animators and industry practitioners. This focus on adaptation capability distinguishes our survey from other reviews which focus on general technology developments. Three main methodologies (example-based; simulation-based and hybrid) are summarised and evaluated using compound metrics: adaptivity, naturalness and controllability. By assessing existing techniques according to this classification we are able to determine how well a method corresponds to users’ expectations. We discuss optimization strategies commonly used in motion synthesis literature, and also contemporary perspectives from biology which give us a deeper insight into this problem. We also present observations and reflections from industry practitioners to reveal the operational constraints of character motion synthesis techniques. Our discussion and review presents a unique insight into the subject, and provide essential guidance when selecting appropriate methods to design an adaptive motion controller. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Character motion synthesis; Computer animation","Abe, Y., da Silva, M., Popović, J., Multiobjective control with frictional contacts (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGGRAPH/Eurographics Symposium on Computer Animation.

The concept builds on existing 3D geologic models, which are processed, meshed, assigned realistic electrical parameters and used for our finite element simulations on unstructured tetrahedral grids. The available simulation codes are able to cope with the high degree of geometric complexity in close-to-reality scenarios. To demonstrate the procedure and the capabilities of our method, we show the model preparation and the simulation results for the transient electromagnetic method in the context of a prospective enhanced deep geothermal energy site at the fault 'Roter Kamm' near Schneeberg in Saxony/eastern Germany. We show the changes in the measuring signal caused by the stimulated fracture system in more than 5000. m depth for a range of electrical resistivity contrasts, which represent different porosity, pore connectivity or fluid resistivity variations. When a borehole receiver is advantageously placed at depth, percentage changes in the measuring signal of 25% can be expected. Our study demonstrates, that the optimal positioning of source and receiver is crucial for a successful monitoring and may only be achieved with advanced simulation techniques. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","3D geology model; Deep enhanced geothermal energy; Finite element method; Transient electromagnetics; Unstructured tetrahedral mesh","Afanasjew, M., Börner, J.H., Börner, R.-U., Eiermann, M., Ernst, O., Spitzer, K., Transient electromagnetic fields: their efficient three-dimensional simulation and application to borehole-based observation techniques (2011) International Workshop on Gravity, Electrical and Magnetic Methods and their Applications; Afanasjew, M., Börner, R.-U., Eiermann, M., Ernst, O., Spitzer, K., Efficient three-dimensional time domain TEM simulation using finite elements, a nonlocal boundary condition, multigrid, and rational krylov subspace methods (2013) 5th International Symposium on Three-Dimensional Electromagnetics, p. 4. , Extended Abstracts; Archie, G.E., The electrical resistivity log as an aid in determining some reservoir characteristics (1942) Trans.

However, we demonstrate with practical measurements that there exist two kinds of isolation problems in current virtualized systems, due to cache interference in a multi-core processor. That is, one virtual machine could degrade the performance or obtain the load information of another virtual machine, which running on a same physical machine. Then we present a time-sensitive contention management approach (TSAC) for allocating resources dynamically in the virtual machine monitor, in which virtual machines are controlled to share some physical resources (e.g., CPU or page color) in a dynamical manner, in order to enforce isolation between the virtual machines without sacrificing performance of the virtualized system. We have implemented a working prototype based on Xen, evaluated the implemented prototype with experiments, and experimental results show that TSAC could significantly improve isolation of virtualization. Specifically, compared to the default Xen, TSAC could improve the performance of the victim virtual machine by up to about 78 percent, and perform well in blocking its cache-based load information leakage. © 2014 IEEE.","access control; Cloud; isolation; performance; scheduling; virtual machine","Buyya, R., Broberg, J., Goscinski, A., (2011) Cloud Computing: Principles and Paradigms, , New York, NY, USA: Wiley Feb; Gum, P.H., System/370 extended architecture: Facilities for virtual machines (1983) IBMJ.

Approximately 33% of fire fighter injuries result from exposure to fire leading to the possibility of reducing these injuries through training fire fighters to make better decisions, particularly when under stress. Simulation (and virtual simulation in particular) offers a safe and cost-effective alternative to practice with real fire, offering entry level training to aid fire fighters to reach a specific competency level. With the ubiquity of video game play and advent of new consumer-level physical interfaces for video games (e.g., the Nintendo Wii Fit balance-board and the Microsoft Kinect), serious games (games whose primary purpose is education and training), are able to provide users with innovative interactive techniques that are highly engaging and immersive. This paper reviews the development of serious games and virtual simulation applications that may be utilized for training in the fire service. Current technology allows for the simulation of fire spread and smoke movement along with training certain fire fighting skills and incident command co-ordination. To date, gaming technology is not capable of providing a real world scenario that is completely and faithfully accurate in a dynamic virtual environment. Future work could utilize serious games to also recreate the decision making processes and the physical requirements that fire fighters encounter in an emergency situation. These could be incorporated into a simulation environment where the physical and psychological stresses are analogous to live fire fighting situations. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Consumer electronics; Fire fighting; Physiology; Training; Virtual reality","Austin, C.C., Dussault, G., Ecobichon, D.J., Municipal firefighter exposure groups, time spent at fires and use of self-contained-breathing-apparatus (2001) Am J Ind Med, 40 (6), pp. 683-692; Baker, S.J., Grice, J., Roby, L., Matthews, C., Cardiorespiratory and thermoregulatory response of working in fire-fighter protective clothing in a temperate environment (2000) Ergonomics, 43 (9), pp. 1350-1358; Duncan, H.W., Gardner, G.W., Barnard, R.J., Physiological responses of men working in fire fighting equipment in the heat (1979) Ergonomics, 22 (5), pp. 521-527; Lusa, S., Louhevaara, V., Kinnunen, K., Are the job demands on physical work capacity equal for young and aging firefighters?

Moreover, the garment is usually designed for a reference human model and generally not fitted to other individuals, which largely reduces the reusability of existing 3D garments. In this paper, we introduce proxy mesh to fit 3D garment to another human model whose topology or shape is different from the garment’s reference human model. Firstly, a proxy mesh is generated for the reference human model and the specified human model respectively. Secondly, the garment is parameterized based on the proxy mesh of the reference model and an independent dataset is obtained. Thirdly, the dataset is decoded to the proxy mesh of the other human model and a roughly fitted garment is gained. Lastly, local shape constrains are enforced to the fitted garment and garment-body penetrations are resolved to get a well fitted garment. Our approach is efficient, simple to implement and is potential to be applied to existing applications such as virtual try-on and virtual clothing design. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Clothing simulation; Dressing; Fit; Virtual try-on","Baraff, D., Witkin, A., Large steps in cloth simulation (1998) Proceedings of SIGGRAPH’98, pp. 43-54; Choi, K.J., Ko, H.S., Stable but responsive cloth (2002) ACM Trans Graph, 21, pp. 604-611; Cordier, F., Seo, H., Thalmann, N.M., Made-to-measure technologies for an online clothing store (2003) IEEE Comput Graph Appl, 23, pp. 38-48; Decaudin, P., Virtual garments: a fully geometric approach for clothing design (2006) Eurographics, 25, pp. 625-634; Desbrun, M., Schröder, P., Barr, A., Interactive animation of structured deformable objects (1999) Graphics Interface, pp. 1-8; Fuhrmann, A., Sobotka, G., Gross, C., Distance fields for rapid collision detection in physically based modeling (2003) Proceedings of Graphics on, 2003, pp. 58-65; Hasegawa, S., Fujii, N., Koike, Y., Makoto, S., Real-time rigid body simulation based on volumetric penalty method (2003) Proceedings of the 11th Symposium on Haptic Interfaces for Virtual Environment and Teleoperator Systems; Igarashi, T., Hughes, J.F., Clothing manipulation (2007) Proceedings of the 15th ACM symposium on user interface software and technology, pp. 91-100; Jing, T., Jin, Z., Ligang, L., Zhigeng, P., Hao, Y., Scanning 3D full human bodies using kinects (2012) IEEE Trans Vis Comput Graph, 18, pp. 643-650; Kim, S., Park, C.K., Basic garment pattern generation using geometric modelling method (2007) Int J Cloth Sci Technol, 19, pp. 7-17; Luo, Z.G., Yuen, M.M.F., Reactive 2D/3D garment pattern design modification (2005) Comput Aided Des, 37, pp. 623-630; Meng, Y.W., Mok, P.Y., Jin, X.G., Interactive virtual try-on clothing design system (2010) Comput Aided Des, 42, pp. 310-321; Mori, Y., Igarashi, T., Plushie: an interactive design system for plush toys (2007) ACM Trans Graph, 26, p. 3; Terzopoulos, D., Platt, J.C., Bar, H., Elastically deformable models (1987) Comput Graph, 21, pp. 205-214. , (proc.

The algorithm starts by generating in a 2D domain a number of randomly positioned circular or elliptical elements that are meant to represent virtual asphalt aggregate particles. These elements are then grown by mimicking the biological mechanism called contact inhibition until a target air void content (AVC), chosen by the user, is met. In addition, multiple 2D domains can be converted to 3D and combined to generate a multi-layered realistic representation of the porosity present in asphalt mixtures. In this paper, the working mechanism of the algorithm is described and its efficiency is assessed. Moreover, the validity of the results is discussed, and virtual domains, in both 2 and 3 dimensions, are compared with real CT scans in order to show the efficacy of this approach. It was found that the virtual representations of the asphalt mixture porosity show realistic characteristics in terms of air void content and that the air void size distribution is consistent with that of real specimens. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Air void content; Asphalt; Packing; Porosity","Schpfer, M.P., Abe, S., Childs, C., Walsh, J.J., The impact of porosity and crack density on the elasticity, strength and friction of cohesive granular materials: insights from DEM modelling (2009) Int.

Such incomplete accounting means that electricity and input fuel exporters and other stakeholders suffer an unequal share of the net costs, including negative local ecological impacts. This paper utilizes the term ""water inequity"" to capture this phenomenon. It does not argue against electricity and/or input fuel trading, but focuses on the need to reduce regional water inequity by lowering virtual water imports through sustainable electricity policies. Under unchecked business-as-usual (BAU) trends, water inequity attributable to virtual water imports by the three case study states (Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey) could reach 420.2 million m3 by 2025, which would be 39% higher than total in-state water consumption for electricity generation. These states are already deploying sustainable energy-focused policy tools, including Energy Efficiency Resource Standards (EERS) and Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). This research demonstrates, by means of sustainable energy scenario analysis, that EERS combined with RPS can reduce water inequity by an average of 35% in the states under review, ranging from 34% (Maryland) and 35% (Delaware) to 37% (New Jersey). This will enhance sustainability in terms of energy, environment, economy and equity (E4) for both importing and exporting states. This paper concludes by offering policy options to maximize the synergistic benefits of virtual water inequity reduction. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Dynamic memory allocation mechanisms such as ballooning and memory hotplug were proposed to handle the dynamics of memory demands. However, these mechanisms so far have not been quantitatively or comparatively studied. In this paper, we first develop a runtime system called U-tube, which provides a framework to adopt memory hotplug or ballooning for dynamic memory allocation. We then implement fine-grained memory hotplug in Xen. We demonstrate the effectiveness of U-tube for dynamic memory management through two case studies: dynamic memory balancing and memory overcommitment. With these two case studies, we make a quantitative comparison between memory hotplug and ballooning. The experiments show that there is no absolute winner for different scenarios. Our findings can be very useful for practitioners to choose the suitable dynamic memory management techniques in different scenarios. © 1990-2012 IEEE.","Ballooning; memory hotplug; memory management; virtual machine; virtualization","(2012), http://www.tpc.org/tpcc, [Online].

The system can be driven independently by video, text, and speech, thus can interact with humans through diverse interfaces. The combination of parameterized model and muscular model is used to obtain a tradeoff between computational efficiency and high realism of 3-D facial animation. The online appearance model is used to track 3-D facial motion from video in the framework of particle filtering, and multiple measurements, i.e., pixel color value of input image and Gabor wavelet coefficient of illumination ratio image, are infused to reduce the influence of lighting and person dependence for the construction of online appearance model. The tri-phone model is used to reduce the computational consumption of visual co-articulation in speech synchronized viseme synthesis without sacrificing any performance. The objective and subjective experiments show that the system is suitable for human-machine interaction. © 2013 IEEE.","Facial animation; facial motion tracking; human-machine interface; virtual head","Marcosa, S., Gómez-García-Bermejob, J., Zalama, E., A realistic, virtual head for human-computer interaction (2010) Interact.

We explore the benefits of using virtualization for fault injection and discuss the challenges of implementing fault injection in virtualized systems along with resolutions to those challenges. For experimental evaluation, we use a test platform that consists of the Gigan fault injector, that we have developed, with the Xen virtual machine monitor. We evaluate the degree to which fault injection results obtained from running the target system in a virtual machine are comparable to running the target system on bare hardware. We compare results when injection is done from within the target system versus from the hosting hypervisor. We evaluate the performance benefits of leveraging system virtualization for fault injection. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of our injector and highlight the benefits of leveraging system virtualization for fault injection by describing deployments of Gigan to evaluate both non-virtualized and virtualized systems. © 2015 IEEE.","Fault injection; hypervisors; reliability; virtualization","Arlat, J., Crouzet, Y., Karlsson, J., Folkesson, P., Fuchs, E., Leber, G.H., Comparison of physical and software-implemented fault injection techniques (2003) IEEE Trans.

In the World Wide Web, however, this is different: the representation of three-dimensional scenes in a browser is only a few years old and so far, shadows play at most a minor role. Still, shadows are an important factor in the human perception of three-dimensional worlds, since they increase in general not only the authenticity of a scene, but at the same time provide important clues about where an object is placed in space. The JavaScript-based open-source framework X3DOM plays an essential role in the 3D web development, because it provides an approach for the integration of declarative 3D in HTML5. However, it provides only rudimentary shadow techniques, which are insufficient to today's requirements. In this work, this problem is addressed by first examining existing shadow mapping techniques for their suitability for use in the web. Based on this we provide a concept to improve the shadow representation for X3DOM. We implemented and validated our concept showing the benefit.

Designing effective strategies for influence spread maximization, rumor spread minimization, or epidemic immunization has attracted considerable research attention. However, a key challenge is that many times we can only observe the trace of contagion spreading across network, but the underlying network structure is unknown and the transmission rates between node pairs are unclear to us. In this paper, given the observed information cascades, we aim to address two problems: diffusion network structure inferring and information diffusion pathways tracking. We propose a novel probabilistic model called Network Inferring from Multidimensional Features of Cascades (NIMFC) which takes into account heterogeneous features, including temporal and topological features of cascades, node attributes, and information content, to infer the latent network structure and transmission rates of edges. Also, based on the inferred network structure, we may track diffusion pathways of a cascade in social networks. We use blocked coordinate descent method to learn a sparse estimation of the latent network. Our proposed model NIMFC is evaluated both on large synthetic and real-world data sets, and experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models both in terms of recovering the latent network structure and information pathway tracking. © 2015 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","diffusion network; information cascades; information pathway tracking; network inferring; node attributes; temporal feature; topological feature",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928682997

A prevailing view is that distance concentration, i.e., the tendency of distances in high-dimensional data to become indiscernible, hinders the detection of outliers by making distance-based methods label all points as almost equally good outliers. In this paper, we provide evidence supporting the opinion that such a view is too simple, by demonstrating that distance-based methods can produce more contrasting outlier scores in high-dimensional settings. Furthermore, we show that high dimensionality can have a different impact, by reexamining the notion of reverse nearest neighbors in the unsupervised outlier-detection context. Namely, it was recently observed that the distribution of points' reverse-neighbor counts becomes skewed in high dimensions, resulting in the phenomenon known as hubness. We provide insight into how some points (antihubs) appear very infrequently in k-NN lists of other points, and explain the connection between antihubs, outliers, and existing unsupervised outlier-detection methods. By evaluating the classic k-NN method, the angle-based technique designed for high-dimensional data, the density-based local outlier factor and influenced outlierness methods, and antihub-based methods on various synthetic and real-world data sets, we offer novel insight into the usefulness of reverse neighbor counts in unsupervised outlier detection. © 2014 IEEE.","distance concentration; high-dimensional data; Outlier detection; reverse nearest neighbors","Chandola, V., Banerjee, A., Kumar, V., Anomaly detection: A survey (2009) ACM Comput.

Stimulating cooperation in these networks is a research challenge due to this uncertainty. The reason is that the node behavior is highly influenced by the neighborhood structure. Game theory has been significantly used to model ad hoc networks and optimize cooperation. However, in vehicular interactions, apart from the individual node behavior, networking properties play a vital role in the evolution of cooperation. This paper presents a public goods game (PGG) group interaction model for vehicular networks. We analyze how networking properties can impact the diffusion of cooperation. Simulation results show that higher network connectivity induces higher clustering in the network. This influences the probability of nodes receiving common packets from the neighborhood. The average path length proportional to clustering impacts the benefit sharing in the neighborhood. Results show that cooperation diffusion in these networks cannot be forced but evolves with different networking conditions. © 2014 IEEE.","Cooperation; public goods game (PGG); vehicular networks","Buchegger, S., Le Boudec, J.-Y., Performance analysis of the CONFIDANT protocol: Cooperation of nodes-fairness in dynamic ad hoc networks (2002) Proc. 3rd ACM Int.

Due to the bursty and diverse tenant workloads, over-provisioning for the peak or under-provisioning for the off-peak often results in either infrastructure cost or service level agreement (SLA) penalty cost. Moreover, although the process of scaling out database systems will help DBaaS providers satisfy tenants' service level agreement, its indiscriminate use has performance implications or incurs action cost. In this paper, we propose SmartSLA, a cost-sensitive virtualized resource management system for CPU-bound database services which is composed of two modules. The system modeling module uses machine learning techniques to learn a model for predicting the SLA penalty cost for each tenant under different resource allocations. Based on the learned model, the resource allocating module dynamically adjusts the resource allocation by weighing the potential reduction of SLA penalty cost against increase of infrastructure cost and action cost. SmartSLA is evaluated by using the TPC-W and modified YCSB benchmarks with dynamic workload trace and multiple database tenants. The experimental results show that SmartSLA is able to minimize the total cost under time-varying workloads compared to the other cost-insensitive approaches. © 1990-2012 IEEE.","Cloud computing; database systems; multitenant databases.; virtualization","(2002) Tpc Benchmark W (Web Commerce), , San Francisco, CA, USA, number revision 1.8, Feb; Ahmad, M., Aboulnaga, A., Babu, S., Munagala, K., Interaction-aware scheduling of report-generation workloads (2011) The VLDB J, 20, pp. 589-615. , Aug; Albrecht, C., Merchant, A., Stokely, M., Waliji, M., Labelle, F., Coehlo, N., Shi, X., Schrock, E., Janus: Optimal flash provisioning for cloud storage workloads (2013) Proc.

Unfortunately, this often results in poor content choices and evaluative skills. North American schools have attempted to address this problem through information literacy skills. One role key to teaching these skills is the role of the school librarian. Unfortunately, although much research is available on this role in traditional schools, little research was found on the school librarian’s role and responsibilities in a fully online school. In this study, two online school principals were interviewed regarding skills required to teach information literacy; who in their school was responsible for teaching these skills and how these skills were taught. Results indicate that although there is much potential for teaching information literacy in a fully online school, the reality often falls short due to a chopping up of school librarian duties into tasks assigned to several individuals. © 2015, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.","cyber school; information literacy; online school; school librarian; virtual school","Retrieved January 19 (2010) 2015 from, , http://www.ala.org/aasl/sites/ala.org.aasl/files/content/aasleducation/schoollibrary/2010_standards_with_rubrics_and_statements_1-31-11.pdf; Bathon, J., Baker, B.D., (2013) School finance 2.0: Flexible financing for a virtual world, , Boulder, CO: National Education Policy Center; Beck, D., Maranto, R., Lo, W.J., Parent involvement and student/parent satisfaction in cyber schools.

Methods: Two clinical, controlled and prospective studies were conducted, one with 19 nulliparous women without urinary symptoms, who were evaluated by both electromyography and digital palpation (DP) and another with 27 postmenopausal women with mixed urinary symptoms (assessed by both ICIQ UI-SF and ICIQ-OAB), evaluated by vaginal dynamometry and DP, with a total of 46 women in both studies. This protocol was designed so that the participant would play a video game, seated on a pressure base platform, while commanding it through her pelvic movements. Using a virtual reality game, five activities were performed during 30 min, twice a week, with a total of 10 sessions. Results: A significant increase in PFM strength was found in both the nulliparous (p = 0.0001) and the postmenopausal (p = 0.0001) groups of women, as ascertained by DP. A significant increase in postmenopausal women’s muscle strength and endurance assessed by dynamometry (p = 0.05) and a concomitant decrease in their urinary symptoms, were observed. Conclusion: This virtual reality program promoted an increase in PFM contractility and a decrease in postmenopausal urinary symptoms. © 2015 The International Urogynecological Association","Digital palpation; Electromyography; Muscle strength dynamometer; Pelvic floor; Urinary symptoms; Virtual reality exposure therapy",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928683991

As Haraway envisaged, ‘by the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras, theorised and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism; in short, we are cyborgs’. This article seeks to examine how fiction has responded to such ideas and developments in late twentieth and early twentieth-century audiovisual culture. With reference to the novels Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, Fury, Dance Dance Dance and Luka and the Fire of Life, it examines how Rushdie's and Murakami's fiction registers a reality which simultaneously engages with, and disrupts, spatiality through the aesthetics of virtual cartographies, and the metaphor and materiality of simulacra. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","cybernetics; digital worlds; modernism; Murakami; Rushdie",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928661560

However, differences in the experimental set-up or modelling conditions and the limited number of parameters studied in each case prevent us from obtaining clear conclusions about the real significance of each parameter. In this work, a new approach is proposed for this purpose based on the combination of a validated three-dimensional parametric biomechanical model of the restored tooth and statistical analysis using full factorial analysis of variance. A two-step approach with two virtual tests (with, respectively, 128 and 81 finite element models) was used in the present work to study the effect of several design parameters on the strength of a restored incisor, using full factorial designs. Within the limitations of this study, and for cases where the parameters are within the ranges that were tested, the conclusions indicate that the material of the post is the most significant factor as far as its strength is concerned, the use of a low Young's modulus being preferable for this component. Once the post material has been chosen, the geometry of the post is of less importance than the Young's modulus selected for the core or, especially, for the crown. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","factorial design; finite element analysis; prefabricated posts",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928661482

While this trend helps to reduce cost and to increase performance, it also makes it more challenging to achieve timing guarantees and functional isolation. One approach to achieving functional isolation is to use virtualization. However, virtualization also introduces many challenges to the multicore timing analysis; for instance, the overhead due to cache misses becomes harder to predict, since it depends not only on the direct interference between tasks but also on the indirect interference between virtual processors and the tasks executing on them. In this paper, we present a cache-aware compositional analysis technique that can be used to ensure timing guarantees of components scheduled on a multicore virtualization platform. Our technique improves on previous multicore compositional analyses by accounting for the cache-related overhead in the components’ interfaces, and it addresses the new virtualization-specific challenges in the overhead analysis. To demonstrate the utility of our technique, we report results from an extensive evaluation based on randomly generated workloads. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Cache-aware; Compositional analysis; Interface; Multicore; Virtualization",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928632793

Building upon the marketing, social psychology, and information system literature, this study empirically examines a set of functional determinants derived from the technology acceptance model and socio-psychological determinants drawn from the theory of reasoned action and social cognitive theory that may be responsible for the motivations of participants in online social networks. We propose a model by integrating functional, social, and psychological factors in predicting attitude and online social network usage. The survey outcomes from a cross-sectional study among 387 Facebook users in Malaysia support the hypothesised model. This study contributes by extending the cognitive learning theories in predicting online social networking usage. Particularly, this research presents a different perspective on online social networking by exploring the mediating effect of attitude and the moderating role of individual characteristics. This study demonstrates that desirable changes in the perception of functional benefits, self-efficacy, and need for cognition as well as perceptions of social pressure from significant others might lead to corresponding changes in attitude towards online social networking. Results of the study support the model efficacy and predictive ability of the proposed integrative model which may serve as a theoretical foundation for future researchers interested in examining other virtual community engagements such as blogging, online advertising, and online public relations activities. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","attitude; cognitive learning theories; need for cognition; online social network; self-efficacy; social influence; social networking behaviour",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928399859

The most expressive way to display the human’s emotion is through facial expression analysis. This paper proposes a multiple emotion recognition system that can recognize combinations of up to a maximum of three different emotions using an active appearance model (AAM), the proposed classification standard, and a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier in mobile environments. AAM can take the expression of variations that are calculated by the proposed classification standard according to changes in human expressions in real time. The proposed k-NN can classify basic emotions (normal, happy, sad, angry, surprise) as well as more ambiguous emotions by combining the basic emotions in real time, and each recognized emotion that can be subdivided has strength. Whereas most previous methods of emotion recognition recognize various kind of a single emotion, this paper recognizes various emotions with a combination of the five basic emotions. To be easily understood, the recognized result is presented in three ways on a mobile camera screen. The result of the experiment was an average 85 % recognition rate and a 40 % performance showed optimized emotions. The implemented system can be represented by one of the example for augmented reality on displaying combination of real face video and virtual animation with user’s avatar. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Active appearance model; Ambiguous facial expression; Emotion recognition; k-Nearest neighbor; Multiple facial emotion",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928606989

The analyzing, comparing, and visualizing of resulting simulations becomes more and more challenging due to the growing amounts and multifaceted character of the data. Various data sources, numerous variables and multiple simulations lead to a complex database. Although a variety of software exists suited for the visualization of meteorological data, none of themfulfills all of the typical domain-specific requirements: support for quasi-standard data formats and different grid types, standard visualization techniques for scalar and vector data, visualization of the context (e.g., topography) and other static data, support for multiple presentation devices used in modern sciences (e.g., virtual reality), a user-friendly interface, and suitability for cooperative work. Methods and Results: Instead of attempting to develop yet another new visualization system to fulfill all possible needs in this application domain, our approach is to provide a flexible workflow that combines different existing state-of-the-art visualization software components in order to hide the complexity of 3D data visualization tools from the end user. To complete the workflow and to enable the domain scientists to interactively visualize their data without advanced skills in 3D visualization systems, we developed a lightweight custom visualization application (MEVA - multifaceted environmental data visualization application) that supports the most relevant visualization and interaction techniques and can be easily deployed. Specifically, our workflow combines a variety of different data abstraction methods provided by a state-of-the-art 3D visualization application with the interaction and presentation features of a computer-games engine. Our customized application includes solutions for the analysis of multirun data, specifically with respect to data uncertainty and differences between simulation runs. In an iterative development process, our easy-to-use application was developed in close cooperation with meteorologists and visualization experts. The usability of the application has been validated with user tests. We report on how this application supports the users to prove and disprove existing hypotheses and discover new insights. In addition, the application has been used at public events to communicate research results. © 2015 Helbig et al.",,"Lynch, P., The origins of computer weather prediction and climate modeling (2008) J Comput Phys, 227, pp. 3431-3444;

In this study, we present a stochastic-queuing-network-based approach to performance analysis of migration-enabled clouds in error-prone environment. Several performance metrics are defined and evaluated: utilization, expected task completion time, and task rejection rate under different load conditions and error intensities. To validate the proposed approach, we obtain experimental performance data through a real-world cloud and conduct a confidence-interval analysis. The analysis results suggest the perfect coverage of theoretical performance results by corresponding experimental confidence intervals. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Cloud computing; Confidence interval analysis; Performance evaluation; Queuing networks","Baliga, J., Ayre, R.W.A., Hinton, K., Tucker, R.S., Green cloud computing: Balancing energy in processing, storage, and transport (2011) Proc.

Clinically used methods vary from measuring using rules and calipers to sophisticated methods, based on 3D measuring. Our method combines the added value of 3D measuring and well-known segmentation algorithms to enable volume calculation and achieve reliable and operator-independent analysis, as we demonstrate in the paper. Methods: Developed 3D measuring system is based on laser triangulation with simultaneous color acquisition. Wound shape analysis is based on the edge-determination, virtual healthy skin approximation over the wound and perimeter, area, and volume calculation. In order to validate the approach, eight operators analyzed four different wounds using proposed method. Measuring bias was assessed by comparing measured values with expected values on an artificially modeled set of wounds. Results: Results indicate that the perimeter, area, and volume are measured with a repeatability of 2.5 mm, 12 mm2, and 30 mm3, respectively, and with a measuring bias of -0.2 mm, -8.6 mm2, 24 mm3, respectively. Conclusions: According to the results of verification and the fact that typical wound analysis takes 20 seconds, the method for wound shape measurement can be clinically used as a precise tool for objectively monitoring the wound healing based on measuring its 3D shape and color. © Pavlovčič et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","3D measurement; Healing assessment; Laser triangulation; Wound measurement; Wound segmentation","Kecelj Leskovec, N., Perme Pohar, M., Jezeršek, M., Možina, J., Pavlović, M.D., Lunder, T., Initial healing rates as predictive factors of venous ulcer healing: the use of a laser based three dimensional ulcer measurement (2008) Wound Repair Regen, 16 (4), pp. 507-512; Lubeley, D., Jostschulte, K., Kays, R., Biskup, K., Clasbrummel, B., 3D Wound Measurement System for Telemedica Application Biomedizimische Technik, 50, pp. 1418-1419; Chang, A.C., Dearman, B., Greenwood, J.E., A comparison of wound area measurement techniques: visitrak versus photography (2011) Eplasty, 11, p. e18; Little, C., McDonald, J., Jenkins, M., McCarron, P., An overview of techniques used to measure wound area and volume (2009) J Wound Care, 18 (6), pp. 250-253; Flanagan, M., Wound measurement: can it help us to monitor progression to healing?

The available disassembly evaluation methods today seldom make disassembly as the preferred end-of-life solution for the reuse of parts or components in an economically sustainable way for lower value products. In virtual environment (VE), for instance, a human model is often involved in a digital mock-up model for assembly/disassembly (A/D) evaluation. However, it has limited application areas because of the high cost investment. Focusing on the evaluation of disassembly operations in a VE, a method based on five new criteria – visibility of a part, disassembly angles, number of tools’ changes, path orientation changing, and sub-assembly stability – is proposed here. All five criteria are presented by automatically calculated dimensionless coefficients, thus allowing the evaluation of the complexity of disassembly sequences in a VE. For this purpose, a mixed virtual reality disassembly environment based on Python programming language has been developed, using Visualisation Toolkit and Open Dynamics Engine libraries. The results of the analysis and findings demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach thus providing significant assistance for the evaluation of disassembly sequences during Product Development Process. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","disassembly operations; evaluation; sequences; virtual reality",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928243378

However, the AFT imposes the restrictive log-linear relation between the survival time and the explanatory variables. In this paper, we introduce a relevance vector machine survival (RVMS) model based on Weibull AFT model that enables the use of kernel framework to automatically learn the possible nonlinear effects of the input explanatory variables on target survival times. We take advantage of the Bayesian inference technique in order to estimate the model parameters. We also introduce two approaches to accelerate the RVMS training. In the first approach, an efficient smooth prior is employed that improves the degree of sparsity. In the second approach, a fast marginal likelihood maximization procedure is used for obtaining a sparse solution of survival analysis task by sequential addition and deletion of candidate basis functions. These two approaches, denoted by smooth RVMS and fast RVMS, typically use fewer basis functions than RVMS and improve the RVMS training time; however, they cause a slight degradation in the RVMS performance. We compare the RVMS and the two accelerated approaches with the previous sparse kernel survival analysis method on a synthetic data set as well as six real-world data sets. The proposed kernel survival analysis models have been discovered to be more accurate in prediction, although they benefit from extra sparsity. The main advantages of our proposed models are: 1) extra sparsity that leads to a better generalization and avoids overfitting; 2) automatic relevance sample determination based on data that provide more accuracy, in particular for highly censored survival data; and 3) flexibility to utilize arbitrary number and types of kernel functions (e.g., non-Mercer kernels and multikernel learning).",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928242552

This technique is widely used in TV broadcasting, film production, augmented reality, and virtual environment. This paper proposes a new chroma-keying method, which can automatically remove the background color in an image and accurately segment the foreground objects along with their transparency property. Compared to conventional chroma-keying methods based on color clustering, color difference, or thresholding, the proposed method analyzes the color statistics and color confidence of the image in global range. By analyzing image color statistics, local lightness variation, and experience from human visual perception in HSV color space, a segmentation map called quadmap is automatically generated to segment the image into four types of regions: 1) foreground; 2) background; 3) transparent; and 4) reflective regions. By using quadmap, the proposed chroma-keying system can differentiate between transparent and reflective regions. This has always been a challenging problem in conventional chroma-keying or α matting systems. This improvement generates more reliable foreground colors in reflective regions. As a result, there can be less constrains for foreground scene used in TV-broadcasting or film making. The procedures of the proposed method consist of the following five steps: 1) background region detection based on color statistics and local lightness variation; 2) absolute foreground region detection based on the knowledge of background color and predefined thresholds in Hue channel of HSV color space; 3) reflective region detection based on experience from human visual system; 4) background color propagation based on Laplacian equation; and 5) transparency value and foreground color estimation based on global sampling and color confidence.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928243850

Design and Methods: We conducted an experimental study in 84 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years old classified in two groups based on age adjusted Body Mass Index percentile: Normal weight (n=42) and Excess weight (n=42). Both groups were exposed to social stress as induced by the virtual reality version of the Trier Social Stress Task - participants were requested to give a public speech about positive and negative aspects of their personalities in front of a virtual audience. The outcome measures were salivary cortisol levels and performance in cognitive tests before and after the social stressor. Cognitive tests included the CANTAB Rapid Visual Processing Test (measuring attention response latency and discriminability) and the Iowa Gambling Task (measuring decision-making). Results: Adolescents with excess weight compared to healthy weight controls displayed increased cortisol response and less improvement of attentional performance after the social stressor. Decision-making performance decreased after the social stressor in both groups. Conclusion: Adolescents who are overweight or obese have increased sensitivity to social stress, which detrimentally impacts attentional skills. © 2015 Verdejo-Garcia et al.",,"Ludwig, D.S., Childhood obesity - The shape of things to come (2007) N Engl J Med, 357 (23), pp. 2325-2327. , PMID: 18057334; Strauss, R.S., Pollack, H.A., Social marginalization of overweight children (2003) Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med, 157, pp. 746-752. , PMID: 12912779; Gunnarsdottir, T., Njardvik, U., Olafsdottir, A.S., Craighead, L., Bjarnason, R., Chilhood obesity and co-morbid problems: Effects of Epstein's family-based behavioral treatment in Icelandic sample (2012) J Eval Clin Pract, 18 (2), pp. 465-472. , PMID: 21210895; Rouach, V., Bloch, M., Rosenberg, N., Gilad, S., Limor, R., Stern, N., The acute ghrelin response to a psychological stress challenge does not predict the post-stress urge to eat (2007) Psychoneuroendocrinology, 32 (6), pp. 693-702. , PMID: 17560728; Therrien, F., Drapeau, V., Lalonde, J., Lupien, S.J., Beaulieu, S., Tremblay, A., Awakening cortisol response in lean, obese, and reduced obese individuals: Effect of gender and fat distribution (2007) Obesity, 15 (2), pp. 377-385. , PMID: 17299111; Liang, J., Matheson, B.E., Kaye, W.H., Boutelle, K.N., Neurocognitive correlates of obesity and obesity-related behaviors in children and adolescents (2014) Int J Obes, 38 (4), pp. 494-506. , PMID: 23913029; Davidson, R.J., McEwen, B.S., Social influences on neuroplasticity: Stress and interventions to promote well-being (2012) Nat Neurosci, 15 (5), pp. 689-695. , PMID: 22534579; Tsai, S.F., Huang, T.Y., Chang, C.Y., Hsu, Y.C., Chen, S.J., Yu, L., Social instability stress differentially affects amygdalar neuron adaptations and memory performance in adolescent and adult rats (2014) Front Behav Neurosci, 8, p. 27. , PMID: 24550802; Bechara, A., Decision making, impulse control and loss of willpower to resist drugs: A neurocognitive perspective (2005) Nat Neurosci, 8 (11), pp. 1458-1463. , PMID: 16251988; Chudasama, Y., Passetti, F., Rhodes, S.E.V., Lopian, D., Desai, A., Robbins, T.W., Dissociable aspects of performance on the 5-choice serial reaction time task following lesions of the dorsal anterior cingulate, infralimbic and orbitofrontal cortex in the rat: Differential effects on selectivity, impulsivity and compulsivity (2003) Behav Brain Res, 146 (1), pp. 105-119; Seeyave, D.M., Coleman, S., Appugliese, D., Corwyn, R.F., Bradley, R.H., Davidson, N.S., Ability to delay gratification at age 4 years and risk of overweight at age 11 years (2009) Arch Pediatr Adoles Med, 163 (4), pp. 303-308. , PMID: 19349558; Frazier-Wood, A.C., Carnell, S., Pena, O., Hughes, S.O., O'Connor, T.M., Asherson, P., Reaction time but not response inhibition shares genetic influences with later BMI in 7-10 years-old Obesity, , in press; Cole, T.J., Lobstein, T., Extended international (IOTF) body mass index cut-offs for thinness, overweight and obesity (2012) Pediatr Obes, 7 (4), pp. 284-294. , PMID: 22715120; Van Den Bos, R., Harteveld, M., Stoop, H., Stress and decision-making in humans: Performance is related to cortisol reactivity, albeit differently in men and women (2009) Psychoneuroendocrinology, 34 (10), pp. 1449-1458. , PMID: 19497677; Preston, S.D., Buchanan, T.W., Stansfield, R.B., Bechara, A., Effects of anticipatory stress on decision making in a gambling task (2007) Behav Neurosci, 121 (2), p. 257. , PMID: 17469915; Van Strien, T., Frijters, J.E.R., Bergers, G.P.A., Defares, P.B., The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) for assessment of restrained, emotional, and external eating behavior (1986) International Journal of Eating Disorders, 5 (2), pp. 295-315; Garner, D.M., (1994) EDI 2: Inventario de Trastornos de la Conducta Alimentaria: Manual, , Tea ediciones: Madrid; Kelly, O., Matheson, K., Martinez, A., Merali, Z., Anisman, H., Psychosocial stress evoked by a virtual audience: Relation to neuroendocrine activity (2007) CyberPsychol Behav, 10 (5), pp. 655-662. , PMID: 17927533; Robbins, T.W., James, M., Owen, A.M., Sahakian, B.J., Lawrence, A.D., McInnes, L., A study of performance on tests from the CANTAB battery sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction in a large sample of normal volunteers: Implications for theories of executive functioning and cognitive aging.

This paper operates a switch from myth of return to fantasy. This allows the analysis to be detached from the return speculation’s outcome. It also recognises the cross-generational endurance of return-thinking as functional to the process of identity-building as part of a migrant’s search for well-being. Three British Pakistani migration stories will illustrate how return fantasies are not necessarily a symptom of disengagement with the host society, but are part of a common way human beings have to imagine possible futures for themselves and make sense of their present. Fantasies have the potential to create a virtual transitional space where the individual can re-elaborate experiences in a mode that is safer than the one of reality and may have a positive effect on normalising one’s migration experience. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","British Pakistanis; myth of return; psychoanalytically informed methods; return fantasy; transitional space",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928670116

This study examines whether this effect can be recreated in a virtual environment, by exposing people to virtual bystanders in a classroom setting. Participants (n = 26) first witnessed virtual students answering questions from an English teacher, after which they were also asked to answer questions from the teacher as part of a simulated training for spoken English. During the experiment the attitudes of the other virtual students in the classroom was manipulated; they could whisper either positive or negative remarks to each other when a virtual student was talking or when a participant was talking. The results show that the expressed attitude of virtual bystanders towards the participants affected their selfefficacy, and their avoidance behavior. Furthermore, the experience of witnessing bystanders commenting negatively on the performance of other students raised the participants' heart rate when it was their turn to speak. Two-way interaction effects were also found on self-reported anxiety and self-efficacy. After witnessing bystanders' positive attitude towards peer students, participants' self-efficacy when answering questions received a boost when bystanders were also positive towards them, and a blow when bystanders reversed their attitude by being negative towards them. Still, inconsistency, instead of consistency, between the bystanders' attitudes towards virtual peers and the participants was not found to result in a larger change in the participants' beliefs. Finally the results also reveal that virtual flattering or destructive criticizing affected the participants' beliefs not only about the virtual bystanders, but also about the neutral teacher. Together these findings show that virtual bystanders in a classroom can affect people's beliefs, anxiety and behavior. © 2015 Qu et al.",,"Walster, E., Festinger, L., The effectiveness of ""overheard"" persuasive communications (1962) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 65 (6), pp. 395-402; Chaiken, S., Maheswaran, D., Heuristic processing can bias systematic processing: Effects of source credibility, argument ambiguity, and task importance on attitude judgment (1994) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 66 (3), pp. 460-473. , PMID: 8169760; Wetzel, C.G., Insko Ca.

This differentiation is followed by discussions of cyberspace and Internet screen-space geography. Cyberspace has been spatially defined as artificial reality, interactivity, and conceptual and metaphorical spaces. As a spatial experience, cyberspace involves co-presence, low cognitive mapping, and egalitarian and global communications. The article aims further at the development of interpretations for ISSs and their uses along dimensions originally developed for real-space geography. These include: real space parameters (ground; distance; places; scale/regions; boundaries; and flows); user spatial parameters (speed; directionality; circularity; distanciation); and user socio-spatial parameters (proximity; networking; time–space compression). © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Cyberspace; Image space; Internet; Internet screen-space; Virtual space",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928128754

In the current study, we explored the relationship between visuospatial perspective taking and self-report measures of the cognitive and emotional components of empathy in young adults. To this aim, we employed a priming paradigm, in which the presence of an avatar allowed to anticipate the next perceived perspective on the visual scene. We found that the emotional dimension of empathy was positively correlated with the behavioral advantage provided by the presence of the avatar, relative to unprimed perspective changes. These data suggest a link between the tendency to vicariously experience the others’ emotions and the ability to perform self–other spatial transformations. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Empathy; Mental transformations; Personality traits; Perspective taking; Spatial memory; Virtual reality",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928138653

Purpose: We assessed the influence of receiving generic, genomic information and of physician communication approach on overweight females in simulated clinical weight counseling interactions. Methods: Two hundred participants were randomized to receive information about genomic or behavioral underpinnings of body weight from a virtual reality-based physician who used either a supportive or directive communication approach. Participants completed post-test self-report questionnaires. Results: Genomic explanations for body weight led patients to perceive less blame [F (1,196) = 47.68, p < .0001] and weight stigma [F (1,196) = 5.75, p = .017] in the consultation. They did not lead to negative outcomes in physician-patient interaction or affect health behavior-related attitudes and beliefs. Physician’s supportive or directive communication approach did not moderate these effects. Conclusions: Integrating genomic concepts into health care has potential to positively influence the patient-provider relationship while addressing longstanding challenges in weight management.

Changes may lead the learning model designed with old data, to become inconsistent with the new data, so that adaptation strategies are necessary. Unfortunately, most adaptation strategies are performed only on a batch basis, i.e. after accumulating certain number of samples. This process usually requires a long time, and thus such data may not reflect the current state of the system. However, even the learning system is adapted on a sample basis, most existing on-line learning algorithms adapt slowly to the abrupt changes. To overcome these drawbacks, a new dynamic and on-line ensemble regression (DOER) with fast adaptation capability for on-line prediction of variables given on a sample basis is proposed in this paper. DOER brings together desired properties which are not given by the previous works on on-line ensemble for regression: (1) on-line inclusion and removal of models to keep only the most accurate models with respect to the current state of the system; (2) dynamic adaptation of the models' weights based on their on-line predictions on the recent samples; and (3) on-line adaptation of the models' parameters. The accuracy of each model is obtained using a sliding window that is filled with the predictive errors of the most recent samples. Based on the model's accuracies, weights are dynamically assigned, where accurate models are heavily weighted. When a new sample is available, all the models are retrained, and a new model may be included if the ensemble's performance is not satisfactory. Inaccurate models can be removed for reducing the computational costs. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets are reported to evaluate the effectiveness of the DOER. Results show that DOER offers faster adaptation capability when compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

When network function virtualization (NFV) is enabled, virtualized NFs (vNF) can be placed when and where needed. In this study, we identify the possibility of minimizing the expensive optical/electronic/optical (O/E/O) conversions for NFV chaining in packet/optical datacenters, which is introduced by the on-demand placement of vNFs. When the vNFs of the same NF chain are properly grouped into fewer pods, traffic flows can avoid unnecessary traversals in the optical domain. We formulate the problem of optimal vNF placement in binary integer programming (BIP), and propose an alternative efficient heuristic algorithm to solve this problem. Evaluation results show that our algorithm can achieve near-optimal O/E/O conversions comparable to BIP. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under various scenarios, with comparison to a simple first-fit algorithm. © 2015 IEEE.","datacenter; network function placement; network function virtualization; optical; service chaining","(2013) Architectural Framework ETSI GS NFV 002 V1.1.1, , Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) Oct; Farrington, N., Helios: A hybrid electrical/optical switch architecture for modular data centers (2010) Proc.

NFV concepts do not only apply to data plane functions (i.e., packet processing or forwarding), but also to control plane functions, such as path computation. First, we focus on the IT and network resources that are virtualized to provide the required VNFs. Second, we provide an example of VNF on top of the virtualized infrastructure, by proposing a path computation element (PCE) architecture to deploy a PCE by means of NFV. The instances of the virtualized PCE are deployed on demand, but they are perceived as a single-network element. We present the benefits of such approach by providing experimental validation. © 2015 IEEE.","Cloud and Network Orchestration; GMPLS; Network Function Virtualization; NFV Orchestration and Management; OpenDaylight; OpenStack; Path Computation Element","Chiosi, M., Clarke, D., Willis, P., Reid, A., Feger, J., Bugenhagen, M., Khan, W., Sen, P., Network functions virtualisation: An introduction, benefits, challenges and call for action (2012) SDN AOpenflow World Congr, , https://portal.etsi.org/nfv/nfvwhitepaper.pdf, Oct.

Due to its dynamic three-dimensional (3D) presentation capability on two-dimensional screens, research has addressed the VE in relation to users' spatial cognitive factors. However, little is known about users' preferred cognitive modes for processing visual information and factors that affect visual cognitive processing in experiencing VEs. Research on gender differences in human-computer interaction has developed as a subfield approached from an interdisciplinary perspective that encompasses fields such as information science, marketing, neuroscience, and education. This study aims to investigate whether different visual cognitive styles influence the sense of presence (i.e., simulated experience in VEs) and how visual cognitions and presence affect user satisfaction of the 3D integrated system, as well as to uncover empirical evidence of gender influence on those relationships. A total of 181 college students (90 men, 91 women) in diverse disciplines participated in an experiment using a VE stimulus and were given a questionnaire. The questionnaire was adapted to measure participants' tendencies to use object versus spatial visualization, their sense of presence, and user satisfaction in the VE. Using multigroup structural equation modeling, we examined 3D visual information processing and gender effects. The results identify the relationship among visual cognitions, presence, and user satisfaction in VEs. We find it interesting that the results demonstrated significant gender differences in satisfaction as well as in processing visual information that influences user experience of the 3D VR embedded interface. Whereas women's object visualization style was found to affect their sense of presence in VEs; for men, it was spatial visualization. This result supports and further explains findings of previous studies suggesting that gender effects account for differences in processing visual information. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, crowd simulation is considered from two aspects: intra-group simulation and inter-group simulation. We propose a unified framework for crowd simulation in real-time virtual environment. Based on this framework, for intra-group simulation, we propose a novel density-based information crowd simulation to collision-free. For inter-group simulation, we propose a novel discrete choice (DC) model to realistic simulation of crowds and path planning. Meanwhile, we also propose a variable bounding box method for intra-group/inter-groups intersection problem. The simulation results show that the developed framework allows different group structures to be easily modeled. And the proposed framework could be used for real-time navigation of many moving crowd in complicated virtual environments. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Collision-free; Crowd simulation; Density information; Discrete choice model; Inter-group; Intra-group",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927544504

Methods: Forty-two adult TBI survivors were included in a longitudinal study with a pre- and post-assessments. The experimental intervention involved weekly one-hour sessions conducted over six months. Participants were assessed using the Self-Awareness Deficits Interview (SADI), Patient Competency Rating Scale (PCRS), the Social Skills Scale (SSS), the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe), the System Usability Scale (SUS). Pearson's chi-squared test (χ 2) was applied to determine the percentage of participants who had changed their clinical classification in these tests. Feedback of the intervention was collected through the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). Results: SADI results showed an improvement in participant perceptions of deficits (χ 2∈=∈5.25, p∈<∈0.05), of their implications (χ 2∈=∈4.71, p∈<∈0.05), and of long-term planning (χ 2∈=∈7.86, p∈<∈0.01). PCRS results confirm these findings (χ 2∈=∈5.79, p∈<∈0.05). SSS results were also positive with respect to social skills outcomes (χ 2∈=∈17.52, p∈<∈0.01), and FrSBe results showed behavioral improvements (χ 2∈=∈34.12, p∈<∈0.01). Participants deemed the system accessible (80.43∈±∈8.01 out of 100) and regarded the intervention as interesting and useful (5.74∈±∈0.69 out of 7). Conclusions: Integrative videogame-based group therapy can improve self-awareness, social skills, and behaviors among individuals with chronic TBI, and the approach is considered effective and motivating. © 2015 Llorens et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Neuropsychology; Rehabilitation; Self-awareness; Social skills; Traumatic brain injury; Virtual reality","Sherer, M., Bergloff, P., Levin, E., High, Jr.W.M., Oden, K.E., Nick, T.G., Impaired awareness and employment outcome after traumatic brain injury (1998) J Head Trauma Rehabil, 13 (5), pp. 52-61. , 1:STN:280:DyaK1cvis1enuw%3D%3D 9753535; Sherer, M., Hart, T., Nick, T.G., Measurement of impaired self-awareness after traumatic brain injury: A comparison of the patient competency rating scale and the awareness questionnaire (2003) Brain Inj, 17 (1), pp. 25-37. , 12519645; Simmond, M., Fleming, J., Occupational therapy assessment of self-awareness following traumatic brain injury: A literature review (2003) Br J Occup Ther, 66, pp. 447-453; Bogod, N.M., Mateer, C.A., Macdonald, S.W.S., Self-awareness after traumatic brain injury: A comparison of measures and their relationship to executive functions (2003) J Int Neuropsychol Soc, 9 (3), pp. 450-458. , 12666769; Stuss, D.T., Levine, B., Adult clinical neuropsychology: Lessons from studies of the frontal lobes (2002) Annu Rev Psychol, 53, pp. 401-433. , 11752491; Ham, T.E., Bonnelle, V., Hellyer, P., Jilka, S., Robertson, I.H., Leech, R., The neural basis of impaired self-awareness after traumatic brain injury (2014) Brain, 137 (PART 2), pp. 586-597. , 3914476 24371217; Prigatano, G.P., Schacter, D.L., (1991) Awareness of Deficit after Brain Injury: Clinical and Theoretical Issues, , Oxford University Press New York; Katz, N., Fleming, J., Keren, N., Lightbody, S., Hartman-Maeir, A., Unawareness and/or denial of disability: Implications for occupational therapy intervention (2002) Can J Occup Ther, 69 (5), pp. 281-292. , 12501453; Fleming, J.M., Strong, J., Ashton, R., Self-awareness of deficits in adults with traumatic brain injury: How best to measure?

They are also targets for compounds of potential use in analgesic therapies. Here, we develop a strategy to discover analgesic drugs via structure-based virtual screening based on the recently published NMR structure of the hGlyR-α1 transmembrane domain (PDB ID: 2M6I) and the critical role of residue S296 in hGlyR-α1 potentiation by Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). We screened 1549 FDA-approved drugs in the DrugBank database on an ensemble of 180 hGlyR-α1 structures generated from molecular dynamics simulations of the NMR structure of the hGlyR-α1 transmembrane domain in different lipid environments. Thirteen hit compounds from the screening were selected for functional validation in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing hGlyR-α1. Only one compound showed no potentiation effects; seven potentiated hGlyR-α1 at a level greater than THC at 1 μM. Our virtual screening protocol is generally applicable to drug targets with lipid-facing binding sites.

In this study, a virtual reality system of casting production process named VR-Casting has been developed. The full range of virtual display about the casting process has been revealed under the network environment. Several key technologies applied in VR-Casting were introduced in this paper, such as a novel network running environment, the latest Web3D drawing standard named WebGL, levels of detail technology used for rendering on demand, and the detection and updating technology in the casting motions. Based on the above technologies, different 3D models and the virtual panoramic scene were established. Motion schema and user interface of the casting process was delicately designed to enable the system a better interactivity. The latest internet graphics standard WebGL was used to render the models. As VR-Casting is characterized as lightweight and cross-platform, it offers access to the visualization for various platforms and devices. The demonstration delivers VR-Casting has a broad application prospect like exhibition, education, training, and process analysis. Some tests were implemented on different devices, and the results demonstrated VR-Casting has a splendid performance when conducting tests on rendering models. When using VR-Casting, observer has a certain sense of immersion with arbitrarily adjusting of the observation angle and even watches deeply into the interior of the casts. Thus, observer can master the details in a more comprehensive and diverse way during the casting process. © 2015 Springer-Verlag London","Casting; Graphics rendering; Network; Virtual reality; WebGL",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926628373

It has developed in response to the demand for patient safety and the reduced training times for surgeons. Whilst there is an increasing role of simulation in orthopaedic training, the perception of patients and the general public of this novel method is yet unknown. Patients and the public were given the opportunity to perform a diagnostic knee arthroscopy on a virtual reality ARTHRO Mentor simulator. After their practice session, participants answered a validated questionnaire based on a 5-point Likert Scale assessing their opinions on arthroscopic simulation. Primary objective was observing perception of patients on orthopaedic virtual reality simulation. Findings: There were a total of 159 respondents, of which 86% were of the opinion that simulators are widely used in surgical training and 94% felt that they should be compulsory. 91% would feel safer having an operation by a surgeon trained on simulators, 87% desired their surgeon to be trained on simulators and 72% believed that additional simulator training resulted in better surgeons. Moreover, none of the respondents would want their operation to be performed by a surgeon who had not trained on a simulator. Cronbach's alpha was 0.969. Conclusions: There is also a clear public consensus for this method of training to be more widely utilised and it would enhance public perception of safer training of orthopaedic surgeons. This study of public perception provides a mandate to increase investment and infrastructure in orthopaedic simulation as part of promoting clinical governance. © 2015 Akhtar et al.","Arthroscopy; Perception; Public perception; Surgical simulation; Virtual reality","Chikwe, J., de Souza, A.C., Pepper, J.R., No time to train the surgeons (2004) Brit Med J, 328, pp. 418-419. , 14976074; Bowcott, O., NHS compensation costs rise to £807m.

For a rapidly developing field such as NOTES, a needs analysis must be conducted regularly to discover emerging research trends and areas of potential high impact for a virtual simulator. This paper presents a survey-based study which follows a similar study conducted by this group in 2011 (Sankaranarayanan et al. in Surg Endosc 27:1607–1616, 2013). Methods: A 32-point questionnaire was distributed at the 2012 Natural Orifice Surgery Consortium for Assessment and Research annual meeting. These data were subsequently augmented by an identical online survey, targeted at the members of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, and analyzed. Results: Twenty-eight NOTES experts participated in the 2012 study. Cholecystectomy (CE) procedure remained the most commonly performed NOTES technique, with 18 positive responses (64 %). In contrast to 2011, the popularity of the NOTES appendectomy (AE) was significantly lower, with only 2 (7 %) instances (CE vs. AE, p < 0.001), while the number of peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM, PE) cases had increased significantly, with 11 (39 %) positive responses, respectively (PE vs. AE, p = 0.013). Strong preference toward hybrid rather than pure NOTES techniques (82 vs. 11 %, p < 0.001) was also expressed. Other responses were similar to those in the 2011 study, with the VTEST™ utility in developing and testing new techniques and instruments ranked particularly high. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, a decision was made to focus exclusively on the transvaginal hybrid NOTES cholecystectomy procedure, including both rigid and flexible scope techniques. The importance of developing a virtual NOTES simulator was reaffirmed, with POEM identified as a promising candidate for future simulator development. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Natural orifice surgery; NOTES; POEM; Simulator; Transvaginal; Virtual reality",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926347238

This fMRI study was designed to investigate a neurobiological basis of social perception deficits of patients with schizophrenia in various social situations of daily life and their relationship with clinical symptoms and social dysfunction. Methods: Seventeen patients and 19 controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging, during which participants performed a virtual social perception task, containing an avatar's speech with positive, negative or neutral emotion in a virtual reality space. Participants were asked to determine whether or not the avatar's speech was appropriate to each situation. Results: The significant group × appropriateness interaction was seen in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), resulting from lower activity in patients in the inappropriate condition, and left DLPFC activity was negatively correlated with the severity of negative symptoms and positively correlated with the level of social functioning. The significant appropriateness × emotion interaction observed in the left superior temporal sulcus (STS) was present in controls, but absent in patients, resulting from the existence and absence of a difference between the inappropriate positive and negative conditions, respectively. Conclusions: These findings indicate that dysfunction of the DLPFC-STS network may underlie patients' abnormal social perception in various social situations of daily life. Abnormal functioning of this network may contribute to increases of negative symptoms and decreases of social functioning. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Daily life; Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; Schizophrenia; Social perception; Superior temporal sulcus","Ahmed, A.A., Vander Wyk, B.C., Neural processing of intentional biological motion in unaffected siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder: an fMRI study (2013) Brain Cogn, 83, pp. 297-306; Bara, B.G., Ciaramidaro, A., Walter, H., Adenzato, M., Intentional minds: a philosophical analysis of intention tested through fMRI experiments involving people with schizophrenia, people with autism, and healthy individuals (2011) Front Hum Neurosci, 5, p. 7; Berman, K.F., Illowsky, B.P., Weinberger, D.R., Physiological dysfunction of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia.

Twenty-four older adults were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups (virtual reality training and control). Both groups underwent three sessions including baseline slip, training and transfer of training on slippery surface. Both groups experienced two slips, one during baseline and the other during the transfer of training trial. The training group underwent 12 simulated slips using a visual perturbation induced by tilting a virtual reality scene while walking on the treadmill and the control group performed normal walking during the training session. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected during all the sessions. Results demonstrated a reduced incidence of falls in the training group during the transfer of training trial as compared to the control group. The training group was able to transfer reactive control strategies learned during training to the second slip trial. The reactive adjustments included reduced slip distance. Additionally, gait parameters reflective of gait instability (stride length, step width, variability in stride velocity) reduced after walking in the VR environment for 15–20 min. The results indicated a beneficial effect of the virtual reality training in reducing slip severity and recovery kinematics in healthy older adults. © 2014, Biomedical Engineering Society.","Biomechanics; Elderly; Fall prevention training; Falls; Virtual reality","Bhatt, T., Wang, E., Pai, Y.C., Retention of adaptive control over varying intervals: prevention of slip- induced backward balance loss during gait (2006) J.

It is possible that astronauts' orientation preferences could be a potential predictor for susceptibility to space motion sickness (SMS). The present study was conducted to confirm this relationship on Earth by quantifying orientation preferences and simulating SMS in a virtual reality environment. Two tests were carried out. The first was to quantitatively determine one's orientation preference. Thirty-two participants' vision and body cue preferences were determined by measuring perceptual up (PU) orientations. The ratio of vision and body vector (ROVB) was used as the indicator of one's orientation preference. The second test was to visually induce motion sickness symptoms that represent similar sensory conflicts as SMS using a virtual reality environment. Relationships between ROVB values and motion sickness scores were analyzed, which revealed cubic functions by using optimal fits. According to ROVB level, participants were divided into three groups - body group, vision group, and confusion group - and the factor of gender was further considered as a covariate in the analysis. Consistent differences in motion sickness scores were observed between the three groups. Thus, orientation preference had a significant relationship with susceptibility to simulated SMS symptoms. This knowledge could assist with astronaut selection and might be a useful countermeasure when developing new preflight trainings. © 2015 .","Quantitative orientation preference; Space motion sickness; Susceptibility; Virtual reality environment","Adams, W.J., Frames of reference for the light-from-above prior in visual search and shape judgments (2008) Cognition, 107, pp. 137-150; Albery, W., Martin, E., Development of space motion sickness in a ground-based human centrifuge (1996) Acta Astronaut., 38, pp. 721-731; Aoki, H., Oman, C.M., Buckland, D.A., Natapoff, A., Desktop-VR system for preflight 3D navigation training (2008) Acta Astronaut., 63, pp. 841-847; Barnett-Cowan, M., Jenkin, H.L., Dyde, R.T., Jenkin, M.R., Harris, L.R., Asymmetrical representation of body orientation (2013) J.

Cue exposure therapy (CET) has been proposed as an effective intervention. Objective: To determine which situations and specific cues trigger higher levels of binge craving and to use the results in the development of virtual reality scenarios in which CET could be applied with BN and BED patients. Method: Participants were 101 outpatients, 50 with BED and 51 with BN, according to DSM-5 criteria, and 63 healthy undergraduate students who completed a self-administered questionnaire to assess binge craving. Results: The likelihood of binge craving in the clinical group was greater when alone at home, during the afternoon/early evening and in the late evening/at night, at weekends, and at dinner time or between meals. Higher levels of craving were produced in the kitchen, bedroom, dining room, and bakery situations. With regard to the specific cues reported, the presence of and access to high calorie food and snacks was the most commonly reported cue. Although some gender differences regarding triggering factors were obtained, no statistical differences were observed between ED subtypes. BN and BED patients showed significantly higher levels of binge craving than controls in all the contexts except when feeling positive affect; in this situation, levels of craving were low in both groups. Conclusions: This information regarding trigger contexts and specific cues can be used to create valid and reliable virtual environments for CET. Indeed, the data from this study may serve to develop a wide range of situations with different levels of binge craving, in which the therapeutic aim is to extinguish conditioned responses and facilitate the generalization of craving extinction. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Binge eating; Clinical sample; Cue exposure; Food craving; Virtual reality","Abraham, S.F., Beumont, P.J.V., How patients describe bulimia or binge eating (1982) Psychological Medicine, 12 (3), pp. 625-635; Allison, S., Timmerman, G., Anatomy of a binge.

Can I step over that fence or do I need to duck under it? Can I step off of that ledge or do I need to climb off of it? These qualities of the environment that people perceive that allow them to act are called affordances. This article compares people's judgments of affordances on two tasks in both the real world and in virtual environments presented with head-mounted displays. The two tasks were stepping over or ducking under a pole, and stepping straight off of a ledge. Comparisons between the real world and virtual environments are important because they allow us to evaluate the fidelity of virtual environments. Another reason is that virtual environment technologies enable precise control of the myriad perceptual cues at work in the physical world and deepen our understanding of how people use vision to decide how to act. In the experiments presented here, the presence or absence of a self-avatar - an animated graphical representation of a person embedded in the virtual environment - was a central factor. Another important factor was the presence or absence of action, that is, whether people performed the task or reported that they could or could not perform the task. The results show that animated self-avatars provide critical information for people deciding what they can and cannot do in virtual environments, and that action is significant in people's affordance judgments. © 2015 ACM.","Affordances; Head-mounted displays; Height perception; Virtual reality","Blanke, O., Multisensory brain mechanisms of bodily self-consciousness (2012) Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 13 (8), pp. 556-571. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrn3292, (Aug. 2012); Bodenheimer, B., Ming, J., Wu, H., Narasimham, G., Rump, B., McNamara, T.P., Carr, T.H., Rieser, J.J., Distance estimation in virtual and real environments using bisection (2007) Proceedings of the Symposium on Applied Perception in Graphics and Visualization, pp. 35-40. , Tübingen, Germany; Creem-Regehr, S.H., Kunz, B.R., Perception and action (2010) Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science, 1 (6), pp. 800-810. , (2010); Dalgarno, B., Lee, M.J.W., What are the learning affordances of 3-d virtual environments?

The interest of such a circumstance is that properly designed virtual experiments can enforce particular and convenient conditions. In this paper, we present an application of this paradigm to the popular contrast source inversion (CSI) method. In particular, we first design a set of virtual experiments capable to induce contrast sources exhibiting circular symmetries (with respect to some pivot points). Then, we devise an original and effective regularized CSI scheme, in which a penalty term is added to the usual cost functional, in order to account for the symmetry of the auxiliary unknowns. Notably, the approach does not require any a priori assumption on the unknown contrast, as it relies on the particular nature of the virtual contrast sources. Results with single frequency Fresnel experimental data are given to assess the capabilities of the proposed approach. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Contrast Source Inversion; Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems; Linear Sampling Method; Microwave Imaging; Virtual Scattering Experiments","Colton, D., Kress, R., (1992) Inverse Acoustic and Electromagnetic Scattering Theory, , Berlin, Germany: Springer-Verlag; Kleinman, R.E., Van Den Berg, P.M., An extended modified gradient technique for profile inversion (1993) J.

With network virtualization, the problem of allocating resources to the various tenants, commonly known as the Virtual Network Embedding problem, emerges as a challenge. Its NP-Hard nature has drawn a lot of attention from the research community, many of which however overlooked the type of communication that a given VN may exhibit, assuming that they all exhibit a one-to-one (unicast) communication only. In this paper, we motivate the importance of characterizing the mode of communication in VN requests, and we focus our attention on the problem of embedding VNs with a one-to-many (multicast) communication mode. Throughout this paper, we highlight the unique properties of multicast VNs and its distinct Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, most notably the end-delay and delay-variation constraints for delay-sensitive multicast services. Further, we showcase the limitations of handling a multicast VN as unicast. To this extent, we formally define the VNE problem for Multicast VNs (MVNs) and prove its NP-Hard nature. We propose two novel approach to solve the Multicast VNE (MVNE) problem with end-delay and delay variation constraints: A 3-Step MVNE technique, and a Tabu-Search algorithm. We motivate the intuition behind our proposed embedding techniques, and provide a competitive analysis of our suggested approaches over multiple metrics and against other embedding heuristics. © 1972-2012 IEEE.",,"Chowdhury, N.M., A survey of network virtualization (2010) Comput.

We used a novel mathematical interpolation method based on the modified Shepard's method of Inverse Distance Weighting to compute dynamic clearance that reflected this interaction as well as minimal clearance. This proof-of-principle study included seven young healthy, four post-stroke and four healthy age-matched individuals. A virtual environment designed to assess obstacle circumvention was used to administer a locomotor (walking) and a perceptuo-motor (navigation with a joystick) task. In both tasks, participants were asked to navigate towards a target while avoiding collision with a moving obstacle that approached from either head-on, or 30° left or right. Among young individuals, dynamic clearance did not differ significantly between obstacle approach directions in both tasks. Post-stroke individuals maintained larger and smaller dynamic clearance during the locomotor and the perceptuo-motor task respectively as compared to age-matched controls. Dynamic clearance was larger than minimal distance from the obstacle irrespective of the group, task and obstacle approach direction. Also, in contrast to minimal distance, dynamic clearance can respond differently to different avoidance behaviors. Such a measure can be beneficial in contrasting obstacle avoidance behaviors in different populations with mobility problems. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Collision avoidance; Gait; Navigation; Virtual reality; Visual perception","Chance, S.S., Gaunet, F., Beall, A.C., Loomis, J.M., Locomotion mode affects the updating of objects encountered during travel: The contribution of vestibular and proprioceptive inputs to path integration (1998) Presence: Teleoperators And Virtual Environments, 7, pp. 168-178; Cinelli, M.E., Patla, A.E., Travel path conditions dictate the manner in which individuals avoid collisions (2007) Gait & Posture, 26, pp. 186-193; Darekar, A., Aravind, G., Lamontagne, A., Fung, J., Perceptual and navigational strategies for obstacle circumvention in a virtual environment (2011), pp. 1-5. , In Viritual Rehabilitation (ICVR), 2011 International ConferenceFait, P., McFadyen, B.J., Swaine, B., Cantin, J.F., Alterations to locomotor navigation in a complex environment at 7 and 30 days following a concussion in an elite athlete (2009) Brain Injury, 23, pp. 1-8; Fink, P.W., Foo, P.S., Warren, W.H., Obstacle avoidance during walking in real and virtual environments (2007) ACM Transactions on Applied Perception, 4, pp. 1-18; Franke, R., Nielson, G., Smooth interpolation of large sets of scattered data (1980) International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 15, pp. 1691-1704; Gerin-Lajoie, M., Richards, C.L., McFadyen, B.J., The negotiation of stationary and moving obstructions during walking: anticipatory locomotor adaptations and preservation of personal space (2005) Motor Control, 9, pp. 242-269; Gérin-Lajoie, M., Richards, C.L., Fung, J., McFadyen, B.J., Characteristics of personal space during obstacle circumvention in physical and virtual environments (2008) Gait and Posture, 27, pp. 239-247; Hackney, A.L., van Ruymbeke, N., Bryden, P.J., Cinelli, M.E., Direction of single obstacle circumvention in middle-aged children (2014) Gait and Posture, 40, pp. 113-117; Musselmen, K.E., Yang, J.F., Walking tasks encountered by urban-dwelling adults and persons with incomplete spinal cord injuries (2007) Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine, 39, pp. 567-574; Renka, R.J., Multivariate interpolation of large sets of scattered data (1988) ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, 14, pp. 139-148; Shepard, D., A two-dimensional interpolation function for irregularly-spaced data (1968), pp. 517-524. , In Proc. 1968 23rd ACM National Conf, New YorkShumway-Cook, A., Patla, A.E., Stewart, A., Ferrucci, L., Ciol, M.O., Guralnik, J.M., Environmental demands associated with community mobility in older adults with and without mobility disabilities (2010) Physical Therapy, 82, pp. 670-681; Vallis, L.A., McFadyen, B.J., Locomotor adjustments for circumvention of an obstacle in the travel path (2003) Experimental Brain Research, 152, pp. 409-414",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922682770

Information seeking has been demonstrated to be a main motivator driving web use. Given the challenge brought by quality in the early stage, the healthy development of virtual communities relies on sound information seekers. Mindfulness, which is regarded as a psychological state of consciousness, is an important factor for individuals to make a sound decision. This study develops a research model by extending the updated information systems success model with the consideration of the moderating effect of mindfulness. Data collected from users of virtual communities were used to test the model. The findings suggest that mindfulness negatively moderates the effects of information quality, system quality and service quality on perceived usefulness, which further impacts information seeking in virtual communities.

Taking advantage of such a tactile illusion is one way to provide and realize richer interaction feedback without employing and placing actuators directly at all stimulation target points. However, to further explore its potential, it is important to better understand the underlying physiological and neural mechanism. As such, we measured the brain wave patterns during such tactile illusion and mapped out the corresponding brain activation areas. Participants were given stimulations at different levels with the intention to create veridical (i.e., non-illusory) and phantom sensations at different locations along an external hand-held virtual ruler. The experimental data and analysis indicate that both veridical and illusory sensations involve, among others, the parietal lobe, one of the most important components in the tactile information pathway. In addition, we found that as for the illusory sensation, there is an additional processing resulting in the delay for the ERP (event-related potential) and involvement by the limbic lobe. These point to regarding illusion as a memory and recognition task as a possible explanation. The present study demonstrated some basic understanding; how humans process “virtual” objects and the way associated tactile illusion is generated will be valuable for HCI (Human-Computer Interaction). © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","EEG; ERP; Funneling; Illusory feedback; Neural mechanism; Phantom sensation; Vibro-tactile feedback","Borst, C.W., Cavanaugh, C.D., (2004) Haptic Controller Design and Palm-Sized Vibrotactile Array, , Technical Report, Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana at Lafayette: Lafayette, LA, USA; Borst, C.W., Baiyya, V.B., Enhancing VR-based Visualization with a 2D Vibrotactile Array (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology, pp. 183-186. , Newport Beach, CA, USA, 7 November; Yang, G., Jin, M., Jin, Y., Kang, S., T-mobile: Vibrotactile Display pad with Spatial and Directional Information for Hand-held Device (2010) Proceedings of the Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Taipei International Convention Center, pp. 5245-5250. , Taipei, Taiwan, 18–22 October; Piateski, E., Jones, L., Vibrotactile Pattern Recognition on the Arm and Torso (2005) Proceedings of the First Jointeurohaptics Conferenceand Symposium on Haptic Interfaces for Virtual Environment and Teleoperator Systems, pp. 90-95. , World Haptics 2005, Pisa, Italy, 18–20 March; Geldard, F.A., Sherrick, C.E., The Cutaneous “Rabbit”: A Perceptual Illusion (1972) Science, 178, pp. 178-179; Flach, R., Haggard, P., The cutaneous rabbit revisited (2006) J.

In this study, the ligand-based pharmacophore mapping and atom-based 3D-QSAR approach was carried out on a series of 40 novel pyrrolo[3, 2-d]pyrimidine derivatives acting as EGFR inhibitors. The best pharmacophore hypothesis AAADRR.295 was selected and an atom-based 3D-QSAR model was generated by applying partial least-squares algorithm. The developed model was validated and used as a 3D query in sequential virtual screening study to filter five chemical databases. The obtained compounds were further filtered according to Lipinski rule of five and fitness score. Subsequently, a multistep molecular docking study was employed on the retrieved hits and finally, 12 compounds were prioritized as potential leads against EGFR, which exhibited high docking scores, correlated binding mode to experimentally proven compounds and constructive drug-like properties. The results of this study provide detailed structural insights and emphasize the important binding features of these compounds, which may assists in the design and development of novel EGFR inhibitors. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","2-d]pyrimidine derivatives; 3D-QSAR; Cancer; EGFR; Molecular docking; Pharmacophore; Pyrrolo[3","Seymore, L., Novel anti-cancer agents in development: Exciting prospects and new challenges (1999) Cancer Treat Rev, 25, pp. 301-312; Buolamwini, J.K., Novel molecular targets for cancer drug discovery (2002) The Molecular Basis of Human Cancer, pp. 521-540. , Coleman WB, Tsongalis GJ, eds.

Subjects walked on a treadmill while watching a speed-matched, virtual hallway with and without mediolateral visual perturbations. A motion capture system tracked center of mass (CoM) motion and foot kinematics. Spectral analysis, detrended fluctuation analysis, and local divergence exponents quantified old and young adults' dynamic response to visual perturbations. Old and young adults walked normally with comparable CoM spectral characteristics, lateral step placement temporal persistence, and local divergence exponents. Perturbed visual flow induced significantly larger changes in mediolateral CoM motion in old vs. young adults. Moreover, visual perturbations disrupted the control of lateral step placement and compromised local dynamic stability more significantly in old than young adults. Advanced age induces a greater reliance on visual feedback to maintain balance during waking, an effect that may compensate for degradations in somatosensation. Our findings are relevant to the early diagnosis of sensory-induced balance impairments and also point to the potential use of virtual reality to evaluate sensory rehabilitation and balance training programs for old adults. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Elderly; Optical flow; Sensorimotor; Stability; Virtual reality","American college of sports medicine.

The main goal is to meet the diverse communication needs of the users, while the global system operation satisfies the business and societal goals of the infrastructure and service providers. This calls for solutions that consider both local and global network viewpoints and provide sophisticated system control in a stable and predictable way, while being service-aware. We propose a fully integrated solution along these lines: the VLSP, a service-aware softwaredefined infrastructure for networks and clouds. The VLSP consists of three main distributed systems: a facility performing uniformly logicallycentralized management and control of the infrastructure, called the virtual infrastructure management; an information management infrastructure able to maintain an accurate view of the infrastructure environment at both the local and system levels, called the virtual infrastructure information service; and a lightweight virtualization hypervisor able to perform configuration changes in the infrastructure resources, called the lightweight network hypervisor. We discuss representative use-case scenarios, while we demonstrate how VLSP tunes performance trade-offs for particular service demands. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",,"Galis, A., (2004) Programmable Networks for IP Service Deployment, , Artech House; McKeown, N., Openflow: Enabling Innovation in Campus Networks (2008) ACM SIGCOMM Computer Commun.

On one hand, the proliferation of user terminals such as smartphones, tablets, notebooks, smart TVs, game consoles, and desktop computers makes it extremely difficult to achieve the same level of protection regardless of the device used. On the other hand, when various users share devices (e.g., parents and kids using the same devices at home), the setup of distinct security profiles, policies, and protection rules for the different users of a terminal is far from trivial. In light of this, this article advocates for a paradigm shift in user protection. In our model, protection is decoupled from users' terminals, and it is provided by the access network through a trusted virtual domain. Each trusted virtual domain provides unified and homogeneous security for a single user irrespective of the terminal employed. We describe a user-centric model where nontechnically savvy users can define their own profiles and protection rules in an intuitive way. We show that our model can harness the virtualization power offered by next-generation access networks, especially from network functions virtualization in the points of presence at the edge of telecom operators. We also analyze the distinctive features of our model, and the challenges faced based on the experience gained in the development of a proof of concept. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",,"(2014) Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV) Architectural Framework, , http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV/001_099/002/01.02.01_60/gs_NFV002v010201p.pdf, December; Sherry, J., Making Middleboxes Someone Else's Problem: Network Processing as a Cloud Service Proc.

Its evolution models are too abstract. Set with theoretical parameters, they aim to discover the general evolution laws of supply networks, but the value of their research results in practical applications is weakened. Considering the features of complex supply networks, this paper builds the evolution model in the three dimensions of material, information, and time flows, and adopts a new methodology - agent-based computational experiment (Long, 2014) to implement the evolution model. In this paper, a three-dimensional-flow model and its modeling approaches are proposed. In this model, the approaches for static structure modeling and dynamic evolution modeling are given to support building the material flow model. A general approach for order hierarchical decomposition based on product process, and a coordination solution for agents' consistent knowledge understanding based on public and private ontology with partial information sharing are presented in the information flow modeling. To support collaborating time flows of agents in a distributed and heterogeneous virtual environment, a time flow collaboration scheme based on decoupled model and asynchronous parallel is proposed. The scheme not only ensures the event causality in the virtual world consistent with that in the real world, but also improves the efficiency of the agent-based computational experiment of supply networks to a great extent. In addition, this paper integrates the three-dimensional-flow model for supply network evolution into a reference architecture of agent-based computational experiment, and discusses the implementation solutions of its multiple layers. The architecture provides a more valuable reference to the three-dimensional-flow model implementation as well as the related studies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Agent-based computational experiment; Complex supply network; Evolution; Three-dimensional-flow model","Adamides, E.D., Pomonis, N., The co-evolution of product, production and supply chain decisions, and the emergence of manufacturing strategy (2009) International Journal of Production Economics, 121 (2), pp. 301-312; Chatfield, D.C., Hayya, J.C., Harrison, T.P., A multi-formalism architecture for agent-based, order-centric supply chain simulation (2007) Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory, 15 (2), pp. 153-174; Cigolini, R., Pero, M., Rossi, T., Sianesi, A., Linking supply chain configuration to supply chain performance.

Specifically, the concern of virtual machine (VM) physical co-residency stems from the threat that hostile tenants can leverage various forms of side channels (such as cache covert channels) to exfiltrate sensitive information of victims on the same physical system. However, on virtualized x86 systems, covert channel attacks have not yet proven to be practical, and thus the threat is widely considered a 'potential risk.' In this paper, we present a novel covert channel attack that is capable of high-bandwidth and reliable data transmission in the cloud. We first study the application of existing cache channel techniques in a virtualized environment and uncover their major insufficiency and difficulties. We then overcome these obstacles by: 1) redesigning a pure timing-based data transmission scheme, and 2) exploiting the memory bus as a high-bandwidth covert channel medium. We further design and implement a robust communication protocol and demonstrate realistic covert channel attacks on various virtualized x86 systems. Our experimental results show that covert channels do pose serious threats to information security in the cloud. Finally, we discuss our insights on covert channel mitigation in virtualized environments. © 2014 IEEE.","Cloud; covert channel; network security","Wang, Z., Lee, R.B., Covert and side channels due to processor architecture (2006) Proc. 22nd ACSAC, pp. 473-482; Ristenpart, T., Tromer, E., Shacham, H., Savage, S., Hey, you, get off of my cloud: Exploring information leakage in third-party compute clouds (2009) Proc. 16th ACM CCS, pp. 199-212; Zhang, Y., Juels, A., Oprea, A., Reiter, M.K., HomeAlone: Co-residency detection in the cloud via side-channel analysis (2011) Proc.

In particular, a 6-DOF UR-5 industrial robot arm is equipped with sensors to observe the welding process, including a compact 3D weld pool surface sensing system and an additional camera to provide direct view of the work-piece. Human welder operates a virtual welding torch, whose motion is tracked by a Leap sensor. To remotely operate the robot based on the motion information from the Leap sensor, a predictive control approach is proposed to accurately track the human motion by controlling the speed of the robot arm movement. Tracking experiments are conducted to track both simulated movement with varying speed and actual human hand movement. It is found that the proposed predictive controller is able to track human hand movement with satisfactory accuracy. A welding experiment has also been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed remotely-controlled welding system. A foundation is thus established to realize teleoperation and help transfer human knowledge to the welding robot. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Motion tracking; predictive control; robot arm; teleoperation; welding","Guu, A.C., Rokhlin, S.I., Arc weld process control using radiographic sensing (1992) Mater.

Mechanical response of biological soft tissue always exhibits a strong variability due to the complex microstructure and different loading conditions. The inhomogeneity in human artery tissue is modeled with a computational probabilistic approach by assuming that the instantaneous stress at a specific strain varies according to normal distribution. Material parameters of the artery tissue which are modeled with a combined logarithmic and polynomial energy equation are represented by a statistical function with normal distribution. Mean and standard deviation of the material parameters are determined using genetic algorithm (GA) and inverse mean-value first-order second-moment (IMVFOSM) method, respectively. This nondeterministic approach was verified using computer simulation based on the Monte-Carlo (MC) method. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the MC simulation corresponds well with that of the experimental stress-strain data and the probabilistic approach is further validated using data from other studies. By taking into account the inhomogeneous mechanical properties of human biological tissue, the proposed method is suitable for realistic virtual simulation as well as an accurate computational approach for medical device validation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Human arterial tissue; Medical simulation; Probabilistic approach; Tissue modeling; Uncertainty analysis","Alastrué, V., Garía, A., Peña, E., Rodríguez, J.F., Martínez, M.A., Doblaré, M., Numerical framework for patient-specific computational modelling of vascular tissue (2010) Int.

We are currently observing a transition from software-defined networking (SDN) focusing solely on programming packet-switching network elements based on lower-layer flow-oriented primitives toward the wider concept of infrastructure programmability. Such programmability extends vertically within the network stack to encompass optical layer capabilities as well as features located at upper layers of the traditional network stack. In addition, infrastructure programmability extends horizontally well beyond SDN to other resource stacks to encompass virtualized compute and storage resources. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",,,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927593282

Service chaining (i.e., steering traffic through a sequence of network functions) is one emerging application of software-defined networking. However, existing schemes steer traffic solely in the packet domain, which is well suited for fine-grained (e.g., peruser level) flows carrying a relatively small volume of traffic. This article discusses how packet-based schemes do not yield sufficient efficiency for large/aggregated flows steered through high-capacity core network functions. It introduces an optical steering domain into the operator's data centers for NFV service chaining at a coarse-grained traffic level using wavelength switching. Performance evaluation shows that the optical steering domain can achieve significant power savings compared to using packet technologies as flow rates and the number of vNFs per service chain grow. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",,"(2012) Network Functions Virtualization, an Introduction, Benefits, Enablers, Challenges & Call for Action, , http://portal.etsi.org/NFV/NFV_White_Paper.pdf, White Paper Oct; Wang, G., c-Through: Part-time Optics in Data Centers Proc.

Under particular conditions, such as in the rubber hand illusion external objects can be incorporated in one's own body representation, following congruent visuo-tactile stroking of one's own and a fake hand. This procedure induces an illusory sense of ownership for the fake hand and a shift of proprioceptive localization of the own hand towards the fake hand. Here we investigated whether pure visuo-motor, instead of visuo-tactile, congruency between one's own hand and a detached myoelectric-controlled robotic hand can induce similar embodiment effects. We found a shift of proprioceptive hand localization toward the robot hand, only following synchronized real hand/robot hand movements. Notably, no modulation was found of the sense of ownership following either synchronous or asynchronous-movement training. Our findings suggest that visuo-motor synchrony can drive the localization of one's own body parts in space, even when somatosensory input is kept constant and the experience of body ownership is maintained. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Body representation; Embodiment; Ownership; Peripersonal space; Rubber hand illusion","Armel, K.C., Ramachandran, V.S., Projecting sensations to external objects: evidence from skin conductance response (2003) Proc.

Both properties have been the subject of psychophysical characterisation in terms of magnitude estimation experiments and discrimination experiments, which are discussed. For viscosity, both oral and manual perception is discussed, as well as the perception of the viscosity of a mechanical system. For wetness, the relevant cues are identified and factors affecting perception are discussed. Finally, some conclusions are drawn pertaining to both properties. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Fluid; Psychophysics; Touch; Viscosity; Wetness","Ackerley, R., Olausson, H., Wessberg, J., McGlone, F., Wetness perception across body sites (2012) Neuroscience Letters, 522, pp. 73-77; Baumgartner, E., Wiebel, C.B., Gegenfurtner, K.R., Visual and haptic representations of material properties (2013) Multisensory Research, 26, pp. 429-455; Beauregard, G.L., Srinivasan, M.A., Durlach, N.I., The manual resolution of viscosity and mass (1995) Proceedings of the ASME dynamic systems and control division, pp. 657-662. , 57-2; Bentley, I.M., The synthetic experiment (1900) American Journal of Psychology, 11, pp. 405-425; Bergmann Tiest, W.M., Tactual perception of material properties (2010) Vision Research, 50, pp. 2775-2782; Bergmann Tiest, W.M., Kosters, N.D., Kappers, A.M.L., Daanen, H.A.M., Haptic perception of wetness (2012) Acta Psychologica, 141, pp. 159-163; Bergmann Tiest, W.M., Kosters, N.D., Kappers, A.M.L., Daanen, H.A.M., Phase change materials and the perception of wetness (2012) Ergonomics, 55, pp. 508-512; Bergmann Tiest, W.M., Vrijling, A.C.L., Kappers, A.M.L., Haptic discrimination and matching of viscosity (2013) IEEE Transactions on Haptics, 6, pp. 24-34; Christensen, C.M., Oral perception of solution viscosity (1979) Journal of Texture Studies, 10, pp. 153-164; Christensen, C.M., Effects of taste quality and intensity on oral perception of viscosity (1980) Perception & Psychophysics, 28, pp. 315-320; Christensen, C.M., Casper, L.M., Oral and nonoral perception of solution viscosity (1987) Journal of Food Science, 52, pp. 445-447; Eidelberg, L., Die Empfindung naß und trocken (1928) Zeitschrift für die gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie, 115, pp. 580-585; Filingeri, D., Redortier, B., Hodder, S., Havenith, G., The role of decreasing contact temperatures and skin cooling in the perception of skin wetness (2013) Neuroscience Letters, 551, pp. 65-69; Filingeri, D., Redortier, B., Hodder, S., Havenith, G., Thermal and tactile interactions in the perception of local skin wetness at rest and during exercise in thermo-neutral and warm environments (2014) Neuroscience, 258, pp. 121-130; Filingeri, D., Redortier, B., Hodder, S., Havenith, G., Warm temperature stimulus suppresses the perception of skin wetness during initial contact with a wet surface (2014) Skin Research and Technology; Fukazawa, T., Havenith, G., Differences in comfort perception in relation to local and whole body skin wettedness (2009) European Journal of Applied Physiology, 106, pp. 15-24; Guest, S., Ma, A., Mehrabyan, A., Essick, G., Hopkinson, A., McGlone, F., Perception of fluids with diverse rheology applied to the underarm versus forearm skin (2012) Somatosensory and Motor Research, 29, pp. 89-102; Houska, M., Valentova, H., Novotna, P., Strohalm, J., Sestak, J., Pokorny, J., Shear rates during oral and nonoral perception of viscosity of fluid foods (1998) Journal of Texture Studies, 29, pp. 603-615; Höver, R., Kósa, G., Székely, G., Harders, M., Data-driven haptic rendering-from viscous fluids to visco-elastic solids (2009) IEEE Transactions on Haptics, 2, pp. 15-27; Jeon, E., Yoo, S., Kim, E., Psychophysical determination of moisture perception in high-performance shirt fabrics in relation to sweating level (2011) Ergonomics, 54, pp. 576-586; Johansson, R.S., Vallbo Å, B., Tactile sensory coding in the glabrous skin of the human hand (1983) Trends in Neurosciences, 6, pp. 27-32; Jones, L.A., Hunter, I.W., A perceptual analysis of viscosity (1993) Experimental Brain Research, 94, pp. 343-351; Li, Y., Perceptions of temperature, moisture and comfort in clothing during environmental transients (2005) Ergonomics, 48, pp. 234-248; Li, Y., Plante, A.M., Holcombe, B.V., The physical mechanisms of the perception of dampness in fabrics (1993) Journal of Thermal Biology, 18, pp. 417-419; Moskowitz, H.R., Scales of subjective viscosity and fluidity of gum solutions (1972) Journal of Texture Studies, 3, pp. 89-100; Niedermann, R., Rossi, R.M., Objective and subjective evaluation of the human thermal sensation of wet fabrics (2012) Textile Research Journal, 82, pp. 374-384; Roberts, B.J., A study of the viscosity of saliva at different shear rates in dentate and edentulous patients (1977) Journal of Dentistry, 5, pp. 303-309; Scott Blair, G.W., Coppen, F.M.V., The subjective judgements of the elastic and plastic properties of soft bodies; the ""differential thresholds"" for viscosities and compression moduli (1939) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Manifestation of facial skin is subjected to the physical and physiological state of human emotions. The facial expression and appearance alters as we move, talk, think and endure stress under constant flux. The colors of skin is one of the key indicators of these changes and the color resolution is decided by the scattering and absorption of light within the skin layers containing chromophores in the melanin and hemoglobin oxygenation in the blood. Understanding the facial color distribution, homogeneity of the pigmentation or skin quality under stimuli are the key issues. We examine the correlation between blood oxygenation in changing facial skin color and basic natural emotional expressions such as angry, happy, sad and fear using the Pulse Oximetry and 3D skin analyzer. The data from seven subjects with three female of age 17, 25 and 35 years, four male of 22, 30, 36, 40 years under different number of partially extreme facial expressions are feed in the new dynamic model for simulation. Experimental results are analyzed to establish a direct relationship between human emotion and facial oxygenation. The strong emotion such as anger is found to stimulate more oxygen under facial skin transforming the face red or rosiness. Furthermore, other emotions assisted with less oxygen concentration create the skin pallor or whitish. Our results in perceiving the human emotions based on facial skin color may contribute towards the development of human aided virtual reality and game environment. ©2015, 3D Research Center, Kwangwoon University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Blood oxygenation; Emotion; Facial expression; Facial skin color; Pallor; Skin analysis; Virtual reality and game environment","Perrett, D.I., Effects of sexual dimorphism on facial attractiveness (1998) Nature, 394 (6696), pp. 884-887; Perrett, D.I., Symmetry and human facial attractiveness (1999) Evolution and Human Behavior, 20 (5), pp. 295-309; Rhodes, G., Sumich, A., Byatt, G., Are average facial configurations attractive only because of their symmetry?

The mode of transmission and the virulence of the pathogens are still enigmatic. Transcription regulatory elements, such as rho proteins, play an important role in the termination of transcription and/or the selection of genes in Brucella. Adverse effects of the transcription inhibitors play a key role in the non-successive transcription challenges faced by the pathogens. In the investigation presented here, we computationally predicted the transcription termination factor rho (TtFRho) inhibitors against Brucella melitensis 16M via a structure-based method. In view the unknown nature of its crystal structure, we constructed a robust three-dimensional homology model of TtFRho’s structure by comparative modeling with the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli TtFRho (Protein Data Bank ID: 1PVO) as a template in MODELLER (v 9.10). The modeled structure was optimized by applying a molecular dynamics simulation for 2 ns with the CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Macromolecular Mechanics) 27 force field in NAMD (NAnoscale Molecular Dynamics program; v 2.9) and then evaluated by calculating the stereochemical quality of the protein. The flexible docking for the interaction phenomenon of the template consists of ligand-related inhibitor molecules from the ZINC (ZINC Is Not Commercial) database using a structure-based virtual screening strategy against minimized TtFRho. Docking simulations revealed two inhibitors compounds – ZINC24934545 and ZINC72319544 – that showed high binding affinity among 2,829 drug analogs that bind with key active-site residues; these residues are considered for protein-ligand binding and unbinding pathways via steered molecular dynamics simulations. Arg215 in the model plays an important role in the stability of the protein-ligand complex via a hydrogen bonding interaction by aromatic-π contacts, and the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) analysis of best leads indicate nontoxic in nature with good potential for drug development. © 2015 Zhang et al.","ADMET analysis; Brucellosis; Rho proteins; SMD simulations; Therapeutics; Transcription inhibitors","Espinosa, E.J., Calero, M., Sridevi, K., Pfeffer, S.R., RhoBTB3: A Rho GTPase-family ATPase required for endosome to Golgi transport (2009) Cell, 137 (5), pp. 938-948; Banerjee, S., Chalissery, J., Bandey, I., Sen, R., Rho-dependent transcription termination: More questions than answers (2006) J Microbiol, 44 (1), pp. 11-22; Caldelari, I., Chao, Y., Romby, P., Vogel, J., RNA-mediated regulation in pathogenic bacteria (2013) Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med, 3 (9); Schmidt, M.C., Chamberlin, M.J., Binding of Rho factor to Escherichia coli RNA polymerase mediated by nusA protein (1984) J Biol Chem, 259 (24), pp. 15000-15002; Ingham, C.J., Dennis, J., Furneaux, P.A., Autogenous regulation of transcription termination factor Rho and the requirement for Nus factors in Bacillus subtilis (1999) Mol Microbiol, 31 (2), pp. 651-663; Fiorentini, C., Falzano, L., Travaglione, S., Fabbri, A., Hijacking Rho GTPases by protein toxins and apoptosis: Molecular strategies of pathogenic bacteria (2003) Cell Death Differ, 10 (2), pp. 147-152; Veeranagouda, Y., Husain, F., Tenorio, E.L., Wexler, H.M., Identification of genes required for the survival of B.

Most studies investigated each construct separately, precluding analysis of the interactive and immersive nature of real-life situation. Specialized batteries of tests are under investigation to assess social cognition, which is thought now as a link between neurocognitive disorders and impaired functioning. However, this link accounts for a limited part of the variance of real-life functioning. To fill this gap, advances in virtual reality and affective computing have made it possible to carry out experimental investigations of naturalistic social cognition, in controlled conditions, with good reproducibility. This approach is illustrated with the description of a new paradigm based on an original virtual card game in which subjects interpret emotional displays from a female virtual agent, and decipher her helping intentions. Independent variables concerning emotional expression in terms of valence and intensity were manipulated. We show how several useful dependant variables, ranging from classic experimental psychology data to metacognition or subjective experiences records, may be extracted from a single experiment. Methodological issues about the immersion into a simulated intersubjective situation are considered.The example of this new flexible experimental setting, with regards to the many constructs recognized in social neurosciences, constitutes a rationale for focusing on this potential intermediate link between standardized tests and real-life functioning, and also for using it as an innovative media for cognitive remediation. © 2015 Oker, Prigent, Courgeon, Eyharabide, Urbach, Bazin, Amorim, Passerieux, Martin and Brunet-Gouet..","Facial expression; Schizophrenia; Social cognition; Theory of mind; Virtual agents","Alsina-Jurnet, I., Gutiérrez-Maldonado, J., Influence of personality and individual abilities on the sense of presence experienced in anxiety triggering virtual environments (2010) Int.

This paper describes how a 3-D multimode visual immersive system (3DMVIS) is developed, including system architecture, triplet lens module, head orientation tracking circuit, display module, and sensor signal processing. It supports two operation modes for different applications, corresponding to different combinations of lens. As a portable head-mounted display (HMD) device, it can be used in extensive virtual reality and telepresence applications. In addition, this HMD provides visual accommodation with the aid of manual focus and compatibility with various types of 3-D videos. Hence, users with various levels of myopia can experience this facility without wearing glasses. Meanwhile, a typical application in telepresence is investigated along with a compact panoramic camera system. The 3DMVIS is tested and evaluated with various virtual reality scenes, standard-format 3-D movies, and real-world 360° panoramic videos. In addition, comparisons with other commercial counterparts are presented. Technical specification indicates that the 3DMVIS with its telepresence system satisfies the requirements of practical applications.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926140910

Method Using a fully immersive virtual reality system interfaced with a 3D movement measurement system, younger (7-9 years) and older (10-12 years) children's crossing behaviours were assessed. The parent viewed the same traffic conditions and indicated if their child would cross and how successful she/he expected the child would be when doing so. Results Comparing children's performance with what their parents expected they would do revealed that parents significantly overestimated the inter-vehicle gap threshold of their children, erroneously assuming that children would show safer pedestrian behaviours and select larger inter-vehicle gaps to cross into than they actually did; there were no effects of child age or sex. Child and parent scores were not correlated and a logistic regression indicated these were independent of one another. Conclusions Parents were not accurate in estimating the traffic conditions under which their children would try and cross the street. If parents are not adequately supervising when children cross streets, they may be placing their children at risk of pedestrian injury because they are assuming their children will select larger (safer) inter-vehicle gaps when crossing than children actually do. © 2015 by the BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929590964

Aberrant Wnt-4 activity causes various anomalies leading to gastric, colon, or breast cancer. Wnt-4 is a conserved protein in structure and sequence. All Wnt proteins contain an unusual fold comprising of a thumb (or N-terminal domain) and index finger (or C-terminal domain) bifurcated by a palm domain. The aim of this study was to identify the best inhibitors of Wnt-4 that not only interact with Wnt-4 protein but also with the covalently bound acyl group to inhibit aberrant Wnt-4 activity. A systematic computational approach was used to analyze inhibition of Wnt-4. Palmitoleic acid was docked into Wnt-4 protein, followed by ligand-based virtual screening of nearly 209,847 compounds; conformer generation of 271 compounds resulted from extensive virtual screening and comparative docking of 10,531 conformers of 271 unique compounds through GOLD (Genetic Optimization for Ligand Docking), AutoDock-Vina, and FRED (Fast Rigid Exhaustive Docking) was subsequently performed. Linux scripts was used to handle the libraries of compounds. The best compounds were selected on the basis of having maximum interactions to protein with bound palmitoleic acid. These represented lead inhibitors in further experiments. Palmitoleic acid is important for efficient Wnt activity, but aberrant Wnt-4 expression can be inhibited by designing inhibitors interacting with both protein and palmitoleic acid. © 2015 Hammad and Azam.","Cancer; Comparative study; Inhibitor searching; Molecular docking; Natural products; Thumb-index fold; Virtual screening","Nusse, R., Varmust, H.E., (1992) Wnt Genes.

Simulated surgeries took place over four days with intermittent spacing in between (average time between surgeries of 4.77 (Formula presented.) 0.73 days). The volume of tumor removed (cc), volume of healthy brain removed (cc), and instrument path length (mm) were recorded. Additionally, surgical effectiveness (% tumor removed divided by % healthy brain removed) and efficiency (% tumor removed divided by instrument movement in mm) were calculated. Performance was compared (1) between groups, and (2) for each participant over time to assess the learning curve. In addition, the effect of real-time instruction (“coaching”) was assessed with a randomly selected group of medical students.Results: Neurosurgery residents removed less healthy brain, were more effective in removing tumor and sparing healthy brain tissue, required less instrument movement, and were more efficient in removing tumor tissue than medical students. Medical students approached the resident level of performance over serial sessions. Coached medical students showed more conservative surgical behavior, removing both less tumor and less healthy brain. In sum, neurosurgery residents removed more tumor, removed less healthy brain, and required less instrument movement than medical students. Coaching modified medical student performance.Conclusions: Virtual Reality brain surgery can differentiate operators based on both recent and long-term experience and may be useful in the acquisition and assessment of neurosurgical skills. Coaching alters the learning curve of naïve inexperienced individuals. © 2015 CARS","Coaching; Glioblastoma multiforme tumor; NeuroTouch; Simulator; Training; Virtual reality",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925624396

For maximum utility, prosthetic limbs should accept movement commands and provide force and motion feedback, which can be conveyed with vibrotactile feedback (VIBF). While prior studies have shown that force-based VIBF benefits control, the merits of motion-based VIBF are unclear. Our goal was to clarify the effectiveness of position- and velocity-based VIBF for prosthetic arm control. Methods: Healthy adults with normal limb function practiced a goal-directed task with a virtual myoelectric prosthetic arm. A linear resonant actuator on the wrist provided VIBF. Two groups with nine subjects each received amplitude modulated VIBF in addition to visual feedback while practicing the task. In one group, the VIBF was proportional to the virtual arm's position, and in the other group, velocity. A control group of nine subjects received only visual feedback. Subjects practiced for 240 trials, followed by 180 trials with feedback manipulations for the VIBF groups. Performance was characterized by end-point error, movement time, and a composite skill measure that combined these quantities. A second experiment with a new group of five subjects assessed discrimination capabilities between different position- and velocity-based VIBF profiles. Results: With practice all groups improved their skill in controlling the virtual prosthetic arm. Subjects who received additional position- and velocity-based VIBF learned at the same rate as the control group, who received only visual feedback (learning rate time constant: about 40 trials). When visual feedback was subsequently removed leaving only VIBF, performance was no better than with no feedback at all. When VIBF was removed leaving only visual feedback, about half of the participants performed better, instead of worse. The VIBF discrimination tests showed that subjects could detect virtual arm angular position and velocity differences of about 5 deg and 20 deg/s, respectively. Conclusions: Kinematic VIBF did not increase the rate of skill acquisition or improve performance when controlling a virtual myoelectric prosthetic arm, whether provided in isolation or coupled with visual feedback. VIBF had a deleterious effect on performance for some individuals, who may have had difficulty integrating kinematic VIBF information into their control strategies. © 2015 Hasson and Manczurowsky; licensee BioMed Central.","Motor control; Motor learning; Myoelectric; Prosthetics; Vibrotactile feedback; Virtual reality","McCloskey, D., Kinesthetic sensibility (1978) Physiol Rev, 58 (4), pp. 763-820. , 360251; Collins, D.F., Refshauge, K.M., Todd, G., Gandevia, S.C., Cutaneous receptors contribute to kinesthesia at the index finger, elbow, and knee (2005) J Neurophysiol, 94 (3), pp. 1699-1706. , 1:STN:280:DC%2BD2MvjvFWjtA%3D%3D 15917323; Edin, B.B., Quantitative analysis of static strain sensitivity in human mechanoreceptors from hairy skin (1992) J Neurophysiol, 67 (5), pp. 1105-1113. , 1597700; Schultz, A.E., Kuiken, T.A., Neural interfaces for control of upper limb prostheses: The state of the art and future possibilities (2011) PM R, 3 (1), pp. 55-67. , 21257135; Dhillon, G.S., Horch, K.W., Direct neural sensory feedback and control of a prosthetic arm (2005) IEEE Trans Neural Syst Rehabil Eng, 13 (4), pp. 468-472. , 16425828; Gasson, M., Hutt, B., Goodhew, I., Kyberd, P., Warwick, K., Invasive neural prosthesis for neural signal detection and nerve stimulation (2005) Int J Adapt Control, 19 (5), pp. 365-375; Tan, D.W., Schiefer, M.A., Keith, M.W., Anderson, J.R., Tyler, J., Tyler, D.J., A neural interface provides long-term stable natural touch perception (2014) Sci Transl Med, 6 (257), p. 257ra138. , 25298320; Antfolk, C., D'Alonzo, M., Rosén, B., Lundborg, G., Sebelius, F., Cipriani, C., Sensory feedback in upper limb prosthetics (2013) Expert Rev Med Devices, 10 (1), pp. 45-54. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXnsVel 23278223; Stepp, C.E., An, Q., Matsuoka, Y., Repeated training with augmentative vibrotactile feedback increases object manipulation performance (2012) PLoS One, 7 (2), p. 32743. , 3287982 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38XjsFyksb0%3D 22384283; Wolpert, D.M., Ghahramani, Z., Computational principles of movement neuroscience (2000) Nat Neurosci, 3, pp. 1212-1217. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD3cXotlKit7k%3D 11127840; An, Q., Matsuoka, Y., Stepp, C.E., (2011) Multi-day Training with Vibrotactile Feedback for Virtual Object Manipulation, pp. 1-5. , IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR) Zurich DOI: 10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975337; Rombokas, E., Stepp, C.E., Chang, C., Malhotra, M., Matsuoka, Y., Vibrotactile sensory substitution for electromyographic control of object manipulation (2013) IEEE Trans Biomed Eng, 60 (8), pp. 2226-2232. , 23508245; Pylatiuk, C., Kargov, A., Schulz, S., Design and evaluation of a low-cost force feedback system for myoelectric prosthetic hands (2006) J Prosthet Orthot, 18 (2), pp. 57-61; Chatterjee, A., Chaubey, P., Martin, J., Thakor, N., Testing a prosthetic haptic feedback simulator with an interactive force matching task (2008) J Prosthet Orthot, 20 (2), pp. 27-34; Saunders, I., Vijayakumar, S., The role of feed-forward and feedback processes for closed-loop prosthesis control (2011) J Neuroeng Rehabil, 8 (60), pp. 1-12; Stepp, C.E., Matsuoka, Y., (2010) Relative to Direct Haptic Feedback, Remote Vibrotactile Feedback Improves but Slows Object Manipulation, pp. 2089-2092. , Annual International Conference of the IEEE, Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC) Buenos Aires DOI: 10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626120; Cipriani, C., Zaccone, F., Micera, S., Carrozza, M.C., On the shared control of an EMG-controlled prosthetic hand: Analysis of user-prosthesis interaction (2008) IEEE Trans Robot, 24 (1), pp. 170-184; Peerdeman, B., Boere, D., Witteveen, H., Hermens, H., Stramigioli, S., Rietman, J., Myoelectric forearm prostheses: State of the art from a user-centered perspective (2011) J Rehabil Res Dev, 48 (6), pp. 719-738. , 21938658; Mann, R.W., Reimers, S.D., Kinesthetic sensing for the EMG controlled ""boston Arm"" (1970) IEEE Trans Man-Mach Syst, 11 (1), pp. 110-115; Bark, K., Wheeler, J.W., Premakumar, S., Cutkosky, M.R., (2008) Comparison of Skin Stretch and Vibrotactile Stimulation for Feedback of Proprioceptive Information, pp. 71-78. , IEEE International Symposium on Haptic Interfaces for Virtual Environment and Teleoperator Systems (HAPTICS) Reno, NE DOI: 10.1109/HAPTICS.2008.4479916; Schlag, J., Schlag-Rey, M., Through the eye, slowly; Delays and localization errors in the visual system (2002) Nat Rev Neurosci, 3 (3), p. 191. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD38Xit1GrtLY%3D 11994751; Regan, D., Gray, R., Hamstra, S., Evidence for a neural mechanism that encodes angles (1996) Vision Res, 36 (2), p. 323. , 1:STN:280:DyaK287mslWqtw%3D%3D 8594831; Lieberman, J., Breazeal, C., TIKL: Development of a wearable vibrotactile feedback suit for improved human motor learning (2007) IEEE Trans Robot, 23 (5), pp. 919-926; Shmuelof, L., Krakauer, J.W., Mazzoni, P., How is a motor skill learned?

The objective of this study was to use a ""virtual mirror"" that scaled visual movement feedback to assess body perception during active movement in military personnel with CNSLBP (n = 15) as compared to military healthy control subjects (n = 15). Subjects performed a trunk flexion task while sitting and standing in front of a large screen displaying a full-body virtual mirror-image (avatar) in real-time. Avatar movements were scaled to appear greater, identical, or smaller than the subjects' actual movements. A total of 126 trials with 11 different scaling factors were pseudo-randomized across 6 blocks. After each trial, subjects had to decide whether the avatar's movements were ""greater"" or ""smaller"" than their own movements. Based on this two-alternative forced choice paradigm, a psychophysical curve was fitted to the data for each subject, and several metrics were derived from this curve. In addition, task adherence (kinematics) and virtual reality immersion were assessed. Groups displayed a similar ability to discriminate between different levels of movement scaling. Still, subjects with CNSLBP showed an abnormal performance and tended to overestimate their own movements (a right-shifted psychophysical curve). Subjects showed adequate task adherence, and on average virtual reality immersion was reported to be very good. In conclusion, these results extend previous work in patients with CNSLBP, and denote an important relationship between body perception, movement and pain. As such, the assessment of body perception during active movement can offer new avenues for understanding and managing body perception disturbances and abnormal movement patterns in patients with pain. © 2015 Roosink et al.",,"Moseley, G.L., Flor, H., Targeting cortical representations in the treatment of chronic pain: A review (2012) Neu-rorehabil Neural Repair, 26, pp. 646-652. , PMID: 22331213; Lewis, J.S., Kersten, P., McPherson, K.M., Taylor, G.J., Harris, N., McCabe, C.S., Wherever is my arm?

As known, the number of possible disassembly sequences increases significantly with the number of parts in a product. Thus, generating proper disassembly sequences is critical. Most existing methods often require tremendous computational resources, while, at the same time, they often fail to find realistic and optimal solutions for complex product disassembly. For selective disassembly, for instance, it is important to eliminate the components which are unrelated with the target prior to sequence generation. In order to address this configuration, this paper deals with a method for generating the feasible disassembly sequences for selective disassembly. It is based on the lowest levels of a disassembly product graph. Instead of considering the geometric constraints for each pair of components, the proposed method considers the geometric contact and collision relationships among the components in order to generate the proposed disassembly geometry contacting graph (DGCG). The generation of the disassembly sequences is based on the investigated three cases called micro-units, which consider all the possible situations of relationships among the components in the DGCG. The latter is then used for disassembly sequence generation, thus allowing decreasing the number of possible disassembly sequences. For this purpose, a mixed Virtual Reality Disassembly Environment (VRDE) is developed based on Python programming language using mixed Visualization Toolkit (VTK) and Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) libraries. It is applied for automatic generation of the selective disassembly sequences and is illustrated within two examples. © 2015 Springer-Verlag London","Collision detection; Disassembly geometry contacting graph; Disassembly sequence generation; Geometric contacts; Selective disassembly; Virtual Reality Disassembly Environment",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925431480

The critical issue for a given infrastructure provider (InP), is how to provide customized and on demand resources for multiple service providers (SPs) with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. The should also fairly distribute the network physical resources, such as bandwidth of each physical link, buffer spaces, and processing cycles at each node. In this paper, we propose a new framework based on game theory, for both link and node dynamic allocation between multiple infrastructure providers (InPs) and service providers (SPs). Our approach focuses on provisioning and managing the physical resources in a virtualized network infrastructure. We propose a two-stage approach based on non-cooperative games. The first one is the resource negotiation game where the SP requests link and node resources from multiple InPs. The InP may reject the SP’s request when it can potentially cause network congestion. The second stage of the proposal concerns dynamic resource provisioning and consists of two non cooperative games; the node allocation game and the link allocation game. The objective of both games is to allocate physical resources for different isolated VNs that are sharing the same physical substrate network. In the node allocation game, the proportional share mechanism is used. Every SP assigns a weight and submits a bid to each physical node and thereafter it receives a share proportional to its bid. In the link allocation game we investigate the case when multiple SPs compete for a portion of the available physical network capacity. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves high resource utilization, improves the network performance, and fairly distributes the link and node resources between multiple SPs. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Game theory; Nash equilibrium; Network Virtualization; Resource allocation; Virtual Network Embedding",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925397454

This is due to (1) the lack of convexity and (2) the lack of smoothness (and even continuity). The classic approach consists in minimizing instead a convex surrogate. In this paper, we propose to replace the usually considered deterministic decision rule by a stochastic one, which allows obtaining a smooth risk (generalizing the expected binary loss, and more generally the cost-sensitive loss). Practically, this (empirical) risk is minimized by performing a gradient descent in the function space linearly spanned by a base learner (a.k.a. boosting). We provide a convergence analysis of the resulting algorithm and experiment it on a bunch of synthetic and real-world data sets (with noiseless and noisy domains, compared to convex and non-convex boosters). © 2015 The Author(s)","Binary loss; Boosting; Multi-class classification; Noise-tolerant learning",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925423210

Objective This study aimed at assessing the impact of training with a virtual patient on confidence in providing clinical care for traumatized refugee patients. Methods The authors developed an educational tool based on virtual patient methodology portraying the case of ""Mrs. K"", a traumatized refugee woman with symptoms of PTSD and depression. A group (N=32) of resident psychiatrists tested the system and their confidence in different aspects of providing clinical care for this patient group was evaluated pre- and posttest by using a validated confidence questionnaire. Cronbach's α was calculated for all clusters. Changes between pre- and post-test were compared by using the matched-pair t-test, binomial distribution for exact significance test and a calculation of effect sizes (Cohen's d). Results A statistically significant improvement was exhibited in overall confidence (mean Ä: 0.34; p<0.0001; d: 0.89) as well as in four more specific domains of clinical care, with the area of identifying and evaluating trauma-related diagnoses and disability showing the most prominent improvement (mean Ä: 0.47; p<0.0001; d: 1.00). Conclusions This VP-system can lead to physicians' improvement of confidence in providing transcultural clinical care for traumatized refugee patients. Further research is required to investigate improvement in actual performance and cognitive outcomes with several VPs and in a longterm effect perspective. © 2015 Pantziaras et al.",,"Fleetwood, J., Vaught, W., Feldman, D., Gracely, E., Kassutto, Z., Novack, D., MedEthEx online: A com-puter-based learning program in medical ethics and communication skills (2000) Teach Learn Med, 12, pp. 96-104. , PMID: 11228685; Stevens, A., Hernandex, J., Johnsen, K., Dickerson, R., Raij, A., Harrison, C., The use of virtual patients to teach medical students history taking and communication skills (2006) Am J Surg, 191 (6), pp. 806-811. , PMID: 16720154; McGee, J.B., Neill, J., Goldman, L., Casey, E., Using multimedia virtual patients to enhance the clinical curriculum for medical students (1997) Studies in Health Technology and Informatics, 52, pp. 732-735; Srinivasan, M., Hwang, J.C., West, D., Yellowlees, P.M., Assessment of clinical skills using simulator technologies (2006) Acad Psychiatry, 30, pp. 505-515. , PMID: 17139022; Ellaway, R., Poulton, T., Fors, U., McGee, J.B., Albright, S., Building a virtual patient commons (2008) Med Teach, 30, pp. 170-174. , PMID: 18464142; Saleh, N., The value of virtual patients in medical education (2010) Annals of Behavioral Science and Medical Education, 16, pp. 29-31; Triola, M., Feldman, H., Kalet, A.L., Zabar, S., Kachur, E.K., Gillespie, C., A randomized trial of teaching clinical skills using virtual and live standardized patients (2006) J Gen Intern Med, 21 (5), pp. 424-429. , PMID: 16704382; Raij, A.B., Johnsen, K., Dickerson, R.F., Lok, Cohen, M.S., Duerson, M., Comparing interpersonal interactions with a virtual human to those with a real human.

Here, we explore the effectiveness of active participation in web-based citizen science activities as a means of increasing participant engagement in rehabilitation exercises, through the use of a low-cost haptic joystick interfaced with a laptop computer. Using the joystick, patients navigate a virtual environment representing the site of a citizen science project situated in a polluted canal. Participants are tasked with following a path on a laptop screen representing the canal. The experiment consists of two conditions: in one condition, a citizen science component where participants classify images from the canal is included; and in the other, the citizen science component is absent. Both conditions are tested on a group of young patients undergoing rehabilitation treatments and a group of healthy subjects. A survey administered at the end of both tasks reveals that participants prefer performing the scientific task, and are more likely to choose to repeat it, even at the cost of increasing the time of their rehabilitation exercise. Furthermore, performance indices based on data collected from the joystick indicate significant differences in the trajectories created by patients and healthy subjects, suggesting that the low-cost device can be used in a rehabilitation setting for gauging patient recovery. © 2015 Laut et al.",,"Gunasekera, W.S.L., Bendall, J., Rehabilitation of neurologically injured patients (2005) Neurosurgery, pp. 407-421. , London: Springer;

A universal problem for motile animals is the discovery that a learned route is blocked and a detour is required. Given the substantial neuroscience research on spatial navigation and decision-making it is surprising that so little is known about how the brain solves the detour problem. Here we review the limited number of relevant functional neuroimaging, single unit recording and lesion studies. We find that while the prefrontal cortex (PFC) consistently responds to detours, the hippocampus does not. Recent evidence suggests the hippocampus tracks information about the future path distance to the goal. Based on this evidence we postulate a conceptual model in which: Lateral PFC provides a prediction error signal about the change in the path, frontopolar and superior PFC support the re-formulation of the route plan as a novel subgoal and the hippocampus simulates the new path. More data will be required to validate this model and understand (1) how the system processes the different options; and (2) deals with situations where a new path becomes available (i.e., shortcuts). © 2015 Spiers and Gilbert.","Artificial intelligence; Goals; Hippocampus; Place cells; Planning; Prediction error; Reinforcement learning; Virtual reality","Alvernhe, A., Save, E., Poucet, B., Local remapping of place cell firing in the Tolman detour task (2011) Eur.

There are different tracking solutions based on different physical principles, which mainly define their performance parameters. However, special requirements have to be considered for rehabilitation purposes. This paper studies and compares the accuracy and jitter of three tracking solutions (optical, electromagnetic, and skeleton tracking) in a practical scenario and analyzes the subjective perceptions of 19 healthy subjects, 22 stroke survivors, and 14 physical therapists. The optical tracking system provided the best accuracy (1.074 ± 0.417 cm) while the electromagnetic device provided the most inaccurate results (11.027 ± 2.364 cm). However, this tracking solution provided the best jitter values (0.324 ± 0.093 cm), in contrast to the skeleton tracking, which had the worst results (1.522 ± 0.858 cm). Healthy individuals and professionals preferred the skeleton tracking solution rather than the optical and electromagnetic solution (in that order). Individuals with stroke chose the optical solution over the other options. Our results show that subjective perceptions and preferences are far from being constant among different populations, thus suggesting that these considerations, together with the performance parameters, should be also taken into account when designing a rehabilitation system. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Electromagnetic tracking; Kinect; Motion tracking; Optical tracking; Stroke; Virtual reality; Virtual rehabilitation","Milgram, P., Takemura, H., Utsumi, A., Kishino, F., Augmented reality: A Class of Displays on the Reality-Virtuality Continuum (1995) In Proceedings of the SPIE Conference on Telemanipulator and Telepresence Technologies, Boston, MA, USA, pp. 282-292. , 21 December; Sveistrup, H., Motor rehabilitation using virtual reality (2004) J.

The approach consists in providing a collaborative system associating a user immersed in VR and an automatic path planning process. It is based on semantic, topological and geometric representations of the environment and the planning process is split in two phases: coarse and fine planning. The automatic planner suggests a path to the user and guides him trough a haptic device. The user can escape from the proposed solution if he wants to explore a possible better way. In this case, the interactive system detects the users intention and computes in real-time a new path starting from the users guess. Experiments illustrate the different aspects of the approach: multi-representation of the environment, path planning process, users intent prediction and control sharing. © 2015 Springer-Verlag France","Interactive simulation; Multi-layer architecture; Path planning; Virtual reality",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925012771

This paper involves constructing an integrative behavior framework for autonomous virtual miner agents that populate believably virtual coalmine environment to simulate human behaviors of underground coalmine. In this study, we present an emotional behavior model for virtual miner based on cognitive appraisal theories. The proposed models can generate more believable behaviors in virtual environment based on the personalized emotion states, internal motivation needs, and behavior selection thresholds of virtual miners. In addition, we take into account the impacts of underground mine workers’ personality straits on the intensity threshold of emotions, the emotion’s decay, and the motivation update process. Finally, we implement an interactive virtual environment for underground human behavior simulation. The behavior believability of virtual miner was evaluated with user assessment method. Experimental results show that the proposed models can create more realistic real-time virtual coalmine environments to simulate human behavior resulting in underground accidents. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Emotion; Multi-agent; Virtual environment; Virtual human",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924690089

Lack of interaction and system fidelity is often reported as a main issue in such virtual reality applications. This limitation is a crucial issue as thorough ergonomic analysis is required for an investigation of the biomechanics. In the current study, we investigated the biomechanical responses of the shoulder joint in a simulated assembly task for comparison with the biomechanical responses in virtual environments. Sixteen male healthy novice subjects performed the task on three different platforms: real (RE), virtual (VE), and virtual environment with force feedback (VEF) with low and high precision demands. The subjects repeated the task 12 times (i.e., 12 cycles). High density electromyography fromthe upper trapezius and rotation angles of the shoulder joint were recorded and split into the cycles. The angular trajectories and velocity profiles of the shoulder joint angles over a cycle were computed in 3D. The inter-subject similarity in terms of normalized mutual information on kinematics and electromyography was investigated. Compared with RE the task in VE and VEF was characterized by lower kinematic maxima. The inter-subject similarity in RE compared with intra-subject similarity across the platforms was lower in terms of movement trajectories and greater in terms of trapezius muscle activation. The precision demand resulted in lower inter-and intra-subject similarity across platforms. The proposed approach identifies biomechanical differences in the shoulder joint in both VE and VEF compared with the RE platform, but these differences are less marked in VEmostly due to technical limitations of co-localizing the force feedback system in the VEF platform. © 2015 Samani et al.",,"Chryssolouris, G., Mavrikios, D., Fragos, D., Karabatsou, V., A virtual reality-based experimentation environment for the verification of human-related factors in assembly processes (2000) Robot Comput Integrated Manuf, 16, pp. 267-276; Rebelo, F., Noriega, P., Duarte, E., Soares, M., Using virtual reality to assess user experience (2012) Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, 54, pp. 964-982. , PMID: 22455315; Ma, L., Chablat, D., Bennis, F., Zhang, W., A new simple dynamic muscle fatigue model and its validation (2009) Int J Ind Ergonomics, 39, pp. 211-220; Chaffin, D.B., Digital human modeling for vehicle and workplace design (2001) Society of Automotive Engineers, , Warrendale, PA; Stoffregen, T.A., Bardy, B.G., Smart, L., Pagulayan, R., On the nature and evaluation of fidelity in virtual environments (2003) Virtual and Adaptive Environments: Applications, Implications, and Human Performance Issues, pp. 111-128; McMahan, R.P., Bowman, D.A., Zielinski, D.J., Brady, R.B., Evaluating display fidelity and interaction fidelity in a virtual reality game (2012) Visualization and Computer Graphics IEEE Transactions on, 18, pp. 626-633. , PMID: 22402690; Pontonnier, C., Samani, A., Badawi, M., Madeleine, P., Dumont, G., Assessing the ability of a vr-based assembly task simulation to evaluate physical risk factors (2014) Visualization and Computer Graphics IEEE Transactions on, 20, pp. 664-674; Whitman, L.E., Jorgensen, M., Hathiyari, K., Malzahn, D., Virtual reality: Its usefulness for ergonomic analysis (2004) Proceedings of the 36th Conference on Winter Simulation, pp. 1740-1745; Hu, B., Ma, L., Zhang, W., Salvendy, G., Chablat, D., Predicting real-world ergonomic measurements by simulation in a virtual environment (2011) Int J Ind Ergonomics, 41, pp. 64-71; Arias, P., Robles-Garcia, V., Sanmartin, G., Flores, J., Cudeiro, J., Virtual reality as a tool for evaluation of repetitive rhythmic movements in the elderly and parkinson's disease patients (2012) PLoS One, 7, p. e30021. , PMID: 22279559; Lovern, B., Stroud, L., Ferran, N., Evans, S., Evans, R., Motion analysis of the glenohumeral joint during activities of daily living (2010) Comput Methods Biomech Biomed Engin, 13, pp. 803-809. , PMID: 21153974; Soechting, J., Effect of target size on spatial and temporal characteristics of a pointing movement in man (1984) Experimental Brain Research, 54, pp. 121-132. , PMID: 6698142; Pontonnier, C., De Zee, M., Samani, A., Dumont, G., Madeleine, P., Trend validation of a musculoskeletal model with a workstation design parameter (2011) Proceedings of the ISB Technical Group on Computer Simulation Symposium, pp. 83-84; Pontonnier, C., De Zee, M., Samani, A., Dumont, G., Madeleine, P., Strengths and limitations of a musculoskeletal model for an analysis of simulated meat cutting tasks (2014) Appl Ergon, 45, pp. 592-600. , PMID: 23972453; Merletti, R., Holobar, A., Farina, D., Analysis of motor units with high-density surface electromyography (2008) J Electromyogr Kinesiol, 18, pp. 879-890. , PMID: 19004645; Farina, D., Leclerc, F., Arendt-Nielsen, L., Buttelli, O., Madeleine, P., The change in spatial distribution of upper trapezius muscle activity is correlated to contraction duration (2008) J Electromyogr Kinesiol, 18, pp. 16-25. , PMID: 17049273; Samani, A., Holtermann, A., Søgaard, K., Madeleine, P., Active biofeedback changes the spatial distribution of upper trapezius muscle activity during computer work (2010) Eur J Appl Physiol, 110, pp. 415-423. , PMID: 20512502; Madeleine, P., Leclerc, F., Arendt-Nielsen, L., Ravier, P., Farina, D., Experimental muscle pain changes the spatial distribution of upper trapezius muscle activity during sustained contraction (2006) Clin Neurophysiol, 117, pp. 2436-2445. , PMID: 16996301; Visser, B., De Looze, M.P., De Graaff, M.P., Van Dieën, J.H., Effects of precision demands and mental pressure on muscle activation and hand forces in computer mouse tasks (2004) Ergonomics, 47, pp. 202-217. , PMID: 14660213; Pontonnier, C., Dumont, G., Samani, A., Madeleine, P., Badawi, M., Designing and evaluating a workstation in real and virtual environment: Toward virtual reality based ergonomic design sessions (2014) J Multimodal User Interfaces, 8, pp. 199-208; Mathiassen, S.E., Nordander, C., Svendsen, S.W., Wellman, H.M., Dempsey, P.G., Task-based estimation of mechanical job exposure in occupational groups (2005) Scand J Work Environ Health, pp. 138-151; Mathiassen, S.E., Diversity and variation in biomechanical exposure: What is it, and why would we like to know?

Virtualization attains multifarious resource management objectives including proactive server maintenance, load balancing, pervasive service availability, power management, and fault tolerance by virtual machine (VM) migration. VM migration is a resource-intensive operation as it constantly requires adequate CPU cycles, memory capacity, system cache, and network bandwidth. Consequently, it adversely affects the performance of running applications and cannot be entirely overlooked in contemporary data centers, particularly when user SLA and critical business goals are to be met. The unavailability of a comprehensive survey on VM migration schemes that covers various VM migration aspects such as migration patterns, sequence, application performance, bandwidth optimization, and migration granularity has motivated this review of existing schemes. This paper reviews state-of-the-art live and non-live VM migration schemes. Through an extensive literature review, a detailed thematic taxonomy is proposed for the categorization of VM migration schemes. Critical aspects and related features of current VM migration schemes are inspected through detailed qualitative investigation. We extract significant parameters from existing literature to discuss the commonalities and variances among VM migration schemes. Finally, open research issues and challenges with VM migration that require further consideration to develop optimal VM migration schemes in Cloud Data Centers are briefly addressed. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Data Centers; Post-copy; Pre-copy; Virtualization; VM migration",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924561558

The available PPAR ligands have several side effects leading to health risks justifying the search for new bioactive ligands to activate the PPAR subtypes, in special PPARδ, the less studied PPAR isoform. Here, we used a structure-based virtual screening protocol in order to find out new PPAR ligands. From a lead-like subset of purchasable compounds, we identified 5 compounds with potential PPAR affinity and, from preliminary in vitro assays, 4 of them showed promising biological activity.

As with visual and vibrotactile biofeedback, kinesthetic haptic feedback may assist in postural control, and can achieve balance control. Kinesthetic haptic feedback in terms of body sway can be delivered via a commercially available haptic device and can enhance the balance stability of both young healthy subjects and stroke patients. Method: Our system features a waist-attached smartphone, software running on a computer (PC), and a dedicated Phantom Omni® device. Young healthy participants performed balance tasks after assumption of each of four distinct postures for 30 s (one foot on the ground; the Tandem Romberg stance; one foot on foam; and the Tandem Romberg stance on foam) with eyes closed. Patient eyes were not closed and assumption of the Romberg stance (only) was tested during a balance task 25 s in duration. An Android application running continuously on the smartphone sent mediolateral (ML) and anteroposterior (AP) tilt angles to a PC, which generated kinesthetic haptic feedback via Phantom Omni®. A total of 16 subjects, 8 of whom were young healthy and 8 of whom had suffered stroke, participated in the study. Results: Post-experiment data analysis was performed using MATLAB®. Mean Velocity Displacement (MVD), Planar Deviation (PD), Mediolateral Trajectory (MLT) and Anteroposterior Trajectory (APT) parameters were analyzed to measure reduction in body sway. Our kinesthetic haptic feedback system was effective to reduce postural sway in young healthy subjects regardless of posture and the condition of the substrate (the ground) and to improve MVD and PD in stroke patients who assumed the Romberg stance. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) revealed that kinesthetic haptic feedback significantly reduced body sway in both categories of subjects. Conclusion: Kinesthetic haptic feedback can be implemented using a commercial haptic device and a smartphone. Intuitive balance cues were created using the handle of a haptic device, rendering the approach very simple yet efficient in practice. This novel form of biofeedback will be a useful rehabilitation tool improving the balance of stroke patients. © 2015 Afzal et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Balance training; Kinesthetic haptic feedback; Light touch; Postural stability; Smartphone; Stroke patients",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928233578

We used a computational model to simulate episodes of fibrillation, which we then characterized in terms of both their duration and the population dynamics of the electrical waves which drove them. Monte Carlo sampling revealed that episode durations followed an exponential decay distribution and wave population sizes followed a normal distribution. Half-lives of reentrant episodes increased exponentially with either increasing tissue area to boundary length ratio (A/BL) or decreasing action potential duration (APD), resistance (R) or capacitance (C). We found that the qualitative form of fibrillatory activity (e.g., multi-wavelet reentry (MWR) vs. rotors) was dependent on the ratio of resistance and capacitance to APD; MWR was reliably produced below a ratio of 0.18. We found that a composite of these electrophysiologic parameters, which we term the fibrillogenicity index (Fb = A/(BL∗APD∗R∗C)), reliably predicted the duration of MWR episodes (r2 = 0.93). Given that some of the quantities comprising Fb are amenable to manipulation (via either pharmacologic treatment or catheter ablation), these findings provide a theoretical basis for the development of titrated therapies of atrial fibrillation.

A freeze interaction technique allows users to freeze the augmented view and interact with the virtual content while the camera image is still. In the past, the strength of the freeze interaction technique was that it was able to overcome a shaky view by enabling users to experience a comfortable interaction. However, it froze the whole augmented scene. When a virtual object is updating continuously, the real-world view from the camera remains as a still picture until the user unfreezes the scene, thus reducing the real-time augmented reality experience which, to the user, is not attractive enough. To overcome the current problem, a ‘Freeze-Object’ interaction technique has been implemented for handheld augmented reality. The Freeze-Object interaction technique allows the user to interact with a frozen virtual object in a live real-world scene. A comparative user study was conducted to evaluate the ‘Freeze-Object’ interaction technique in a handheld touch AR environment. The Freeze-Object interaction technique was compared with the existing freeze technique in terms of user performance and user preference of the interaction technique. Users were asked to perform three basic manipulation tasks (translation, rotation and scaling) using both interaction techniques. The results indicated that there was a significant difference between both techniques with regard to the translation task and that for the overall tasks, the users preferred the Freeze-Object interaction over the existing freeze interaction technique because the former technique allows users to see live the real-world view with a frozen virtual object. The improved freeze interaction technique can be used for various applications, such as interior design and maintenance. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Handheld augmented reality; Interaction technique; Touch interaction; User experiment",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924388655

These multidisciplinary interactions lead to challenges that are refected in the high rate of errors occurring during endovascular procedures. Endovascular virtual reality (VR) simulation has evolved from simple benchtop devices to full physic simulators with advanced haptics and dynamic imaging and physiological controls. The latest developments in this feld include the use of fully immersive simulated hybrid angiosuites to train whole endovascular teams in crisis resource management and novel technologies that enable practitioners to build VR simulations based on patient-specifc anatomy. As our understanding of the skills, both technical and nontechnical, required for optimal endovascular performance improves, the requisite tools for objective assessment of these skills are being developed and will further enable the use of VR simulation in the training and assessment of endovascular interventionalists and their entire teams. Simulation training that allows deliberate practice without danger to patients may be key to bridging the gap between new endovascular technology and improved patient outcomes.

The challenge stems partly from the complexity and fluidity of this social process, but also from its covert nature. One powerful tool to enhance experimental control over such dynamic social interactions has been the use of avatars in virtual reality (VR); information about an individual in such an interaction can be collected through the analysis of his or her neurophysiological and behavioral responses. We have developed a unique platform, the Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment (EEVEE), which is built around three main components: (1) different avatars capable of expressing feelings and emotions at various levels based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS); (2) systems for measuring the physiological responses of the observer (heart and respiration rate, skin conductance, gaze and eye movements, facial expression); and (3) a multimodal interface linking the avatar’s behavior to the observer’s neurophysiological response. In this article, we provide a detailed description of the components of this innovative platform and validation data from the first phases of development. Our data show that healthy adults can discriminate different negative emotions, including pain, expressed by avatars at varying intensities. We also provide evidence that masking part of an avatar’s face (top or bottom half) does not prevent the detection of different levels of pain. This innovative and flexible platform provides a unique tool to study and even modulate empathy in a comprehensive and ecological manner in various populations, notably individuals suffering from neurological or psychiatric disorders. © 2015 Jackson, Michon, Geslin, Carignan and Beaudoin.","Affective computing; Avatar; Emotions; Empathy; FACS; Pain; Virtual reality","Achim, A.M., Guitton, M., Jackson, P.L., Boutin, A., Monetta, L., On what ground do we mentalize?

The challenges involved in capturing the movements of humans performing an assembly operation in a real work environment were overcome by developing a marker-based motion capture system and using it in a cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE). The development of the system focuses on real-time human motion capture and automated simulation for ergonomic analysis. Human movements were tracked in a CAVE, with infrared (IR) LEDs mounted on a human body. The captured motion data were used to generate a simulation in real-time and perform an ergonomic analysis in Jack software. The simulation also included the use of Microsoft Kinect as a marker-less human body capture system for the purpose of scaling the digital human model in Jack. The developed system has been demonstrated for human motion capture and ergonomic analysis for the fastening operation of an aircraft fuselage. © 2015 Springer-Verlag London","Assembly simulation; CAVE; Ergonomic analysis; Firefly; Kinect; Motion capture; Virtual fastening",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924257685

In this article, we propose a novel approach to virtual camera control, which builds upon camera control and player modelling to provide the user with an adaptive point-of-view. To achieve this goal, we propose a methodology to model the player’s preferences on virtual camera movements and we employ the resulting models to tailor the viewpoint movements to the player type and her game-play style. Ultimately, the methodology is applied to a 3D platform game and is evaluated through a controlled experiment; the results suggest that the resulting adaptive cinematographic experience is favoured by some player types and it can generate a positive impact on the game performance. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Computer games; Gaze interaction; Player modelling; Virtual camera control",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924176109

However, one of the drawbacks of this concept is the decrease in its performance throughout the time. The objective of this paper is to present a new thermocline-like storage concept, which aims at circumventing this issue. The proposed concept consists of a storage tank filled with a combination of solid material and encapsulated PCMs, forming a multi-layered packed bed, with molten salt as the heat transfer fluid. The performance evaluation of each of the prototypes proposed is virtually tested by means of a detailed numerical methodology which considers the heat transfer and fluid dynamics phenomena present in these devices. The virtual tests carried out are designed so as to take into account several charging and discharging cycles until periodic state is achieved, i.e. when the same amount of energy is stored/released in consecutive charging/discharging cycles. As a result, the dependence of the storage capacity on the PCMs temperatures, the total energy and exergy stored/released, as well as the efficiencies of the storing process are compared for the different thermocline, single PCM, cascaded PCM and the proposed multi-layered solid-PCM (MLSPCM) configurations. The analysis shows that the multi-layered solid-PCM concept is a promising alternative for thermal storage in CSP plants. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","CSP; Multi-layered solid-PCM; Numerical analysis; Phase change materials; Thermal energy storage; Thermocline","Medrano, M., Gil, A., Martorell, I., Potau, X., Cabeza, L.F., State of the art on high temperature thermal energy storage for power generation.

So, we proposed a classification method support vector machine (SVM) with spectral information and texture features (ST-SVM), which incorporates texture features in remotely sensed images into SVM. Using kernel methods, the spectral information and texture features are jointly used for the classification by a SVM formulation. Then, the texture features were calculated based on segmented block matrix image objects using the panchromatic band. A comparison of classification results on real-world data sets demonstrates that the texture features in this paper are useful supplement information for the spectral object-oriented classification, and proposed ST-SVM classification accuracy than the traditional SVM method with only spectral information. © 2015 The Natural Computing Applications Forum","Kernel method; Remotely sensed images classification; ST-SVM; SVM",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924207026

The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the acceptability for elderly subjects of a VR experience using the image-based rendering virtual environment (IBVE) approach and secondly to test the hypothesis that visual cues using VR may enhance the generation of autobiographical memories. Methods: Eighteen healthy volunteers (mean age 68.2 years) presenting memory complaints with a Mini-Mental State Examination score higher than 27 and no history of neuropsychiatric disease were included. Participants were asked to perform an autobiographical fluency task in four conditions. The first condition was a baseline grey screen, the second was a photograph of a well-known location in the participant’s home city (FamPhoto), and the last two conditions displayed VR, ie, a familiar image-based virtual environment (FamIBVE) consisting of an image-based representation of a known landmark square in the center of the city of experimentation (Nice) and an unknown image-based virtual environment (UnknoIBVE), which was captured in a public housing neighborhood containing unrecognizable building fronts. After each of the four experimental conditions, participants filled in self-report questionnaires to assess the task acceptability (levels of emotion, motivation, security, fatigue, and familiarity). CyberSickness and Presence questionnaires were also assessed after the two VR conditions. Autobiographical memory was assessed using a verbal fluency task and quality of the recollection was assessed using the “remember/know” procedure. Results: All subjects completed the experiment. Sense of security and fatigue were not significantly different between the conditions with and without VR. The FamPhoto condition yielded a higher emotion score than the other conditions (P<0.05). The CyberSickness questionnaire showed that participants did not experience sickness during the experiment across the VR conditions. VR stimulates autobiographical memory, as demonstrated by the increased total number of responses on the autobiographical fluency task and the increased number of conscious recollections of memories for familiar versus unknown scenes (P<0.01). Conclusion: The study indicates that VR using the FamIBVE system is well tolerated by the elderly. VR can also stimulate recollections of autobiographical memory and convey familiarity of a given scene, which is an essential requirement for use of VR during reminiscence therapy. © 2015 Benoit et al.","Elderly; Image-based rendering; Immersive environment; Memory; Reminiscence therapy; Virtual reality","Robert, P.H., Konig, A., Rieu, S., Recommendations for ICT use in Alzheimer’s disease assessment: Monaco CTAD expert meeting (2013) J Nutr Health Aging, 17 (8), pp. 653-660; Wichers, M., Simons, C.J., Kramer, I.M., Momentary assessment technology as a tool to help patients with depression help themselves (2011) Acta Psychiatr Scand, 124 (4), pp. 262-272; Leo, G., De Brivio, E., Sautter, S., Supporting autobiographical memory in patients with Alzheimer’s disease using smart phones (2011) Appl Neuropsychol, 18 (1), pp. 69-76; Browne, G., Berry, E., Kapur, N., SenseCam improves memory for recent events and quality of life in a patient with memory retrieval difficulties (2011) Memory, 19 (7), pp. 713-722; Rothbaum, B.O., Hodges, L.F., Ready, D., Graap, K., Alarcon, R.D., Virtual reality exposure therapy for Vietnam veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (2001) J Clin Psychiatry, 62 (8), pp. 617-622; Rizzo, A., Buckwalter, J., Neumann, U., Kesselman, C., Thiebaux, M., Basic issues in the application of virtual reality for the assessment and rehabilitation of cognitive impairments and functional dis abilities (1998) Cyberpsychol Behav, 1 (1), pp. 59-78; Plancher, G., Tirard, A., Gyselinck, V., Nicolas, S., Piolino, P., Using virtual reality to characterize episodic memory profiles in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease: Influence of active and passive encoding (2012) Neuropsychologia, 50 (5), pp. 592-602; Rizzo, A., Kim, G., A SWOT analysis of the field of VR rehabilitation and therapy (2005) Presence, 14, pp. 119-146; Werner, P., Rabinowitz, S., Klinger, E., Korczyn, A.D., Josman, N., Use of the virtual action planning supermarket for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment: A preliminary study (2009) Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord, 27 (4), pp. 301-309; Plancher, G., Barra, J., Orriols, E., Piolino, P., The influence of action on episodic memory: A virtual reality study (2013) Q J Exp Psychol A, 66 (5), pp. 895-909; Parsey, C.M., Schmitter-Edgecombe, M., Applications of technology in neuropsychological assessment (2013) Clin Neuropsychol, 27 (8), pp. 1328-1361; Chen, C., Individual differences in a spatial-semantic virtual environment (2000) J am Soc Inf Sci, 51, pp. 529-542; Cohen-Mansfield, J., Dakheel-Ali, M., Marx, M.S., Engagement in persons with dementia: The concept and its measurement (2009) Am J Geriatr Psychiatry, 17 (4), pp. 299-307; Chung, C., Pollock, A., Campbell, T., Durward, B., Hagen, S., Cognitive rehabilitation for executive dysfunction in adults with stroke or other adult nonprogressive acquired brain damage (2013) Stroke, 44 (7), pp. e77-e78; Laver, K., George, S., Ratcliffe, J., Crotty, M., Virtual reality stroke rehabilitation – hype or hope?

As people age, there are notable declines in proprioception due to changes in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Moreover, the risk of stroke increases with age, with approximately two-thirds of stroke-related hospitalizations occurring in people over the age of 65. In this literature review, we first summarize behavioral studies investigating proprioceptive deficits in normally aging older adults and stroke patients, and discuss the differences in proprioceptive function between these populations. We then provide a state of the art review the literature regarding therapist- and robot-based rehabilitation of the upper extremity proprioceptive dysfunction in stroke populations and discuss avenues of future research. © 2015 Hughes, Tommasino, Budhota and Campolo.","Aging; Proprioception; Rehabilitation robotics; Stroke; Upper extremity","Acerra, N.E., Souvlis, T., Moseley, G., Does mirror-box therapy improve sensory and motor changes in the early post-stroke population?

Virtual Reality is extended in every industry, in every sector, at any level. Important improvements both in software and hardware have had an important impact in its use in the shipbuilding industry, where it is necessary to handle complex ship 3D models with huge amount of data. So, efficiency is the base condition in the Virtual Reality navigation around a vessel. To enhance it, there are three important factors that play a fundamental role. The first one is having an appropriate CAD system with all the information of the ship in a single data base. The second important issue is to have a viewer, which is a tool that allows the management of the 3D model to be used in Virtual Reality environments. No need to say that a good integration between the viewer and the CAD system will be translated into more functionality and better performance. Finally, the third important player is hardware, which makes possibility the Virtual Reality navigation in many different environments. This paper describes first of all different efficient uses of Virtual Reality in the shipbuilding industry, taking in consideration all the agents involved and describing in particular the advantages for any of them. Regarding the software requirements, it will be described in particular the new FVIEWER, developed by SENER for the Virtual Reality navigation and design review and based on the FORAN system. From the hardware side, it will be described some of the most relevant and feasible applications of the Virtual Reality, taking in consideration potential uses and accessible technology in the market. The future of the Virtual Reality in shipbuilding will be explained after that. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying behavioral confounds in VR environments are still poorly understood. In two experiments, we examined the effect of fully immersive 3D stereoscopic presentations and less immersive 2D VR environments on brain functions and behavioral outcomes. In Experiment 1 we examined behavioral and neural underpinnings of spatial navigation tasks using electroencephalography (EEG). In Experiment 2, we examined EEG correlates of postural stability and balance. Our major findings showed that fully immersive 3D VR induced a higher subjective sense of presence along with enhanced success rate of spatial navigation compared to 2D. In Experiment 1 power of frontal midline EEG (FM-theta) was significantly higher during the encoding phase of route presentation in the 3D VR. In Experiment 2, the 3D VR resulted in greater postural instability and modulation of EEG patterns as a function of 3D versus 2D environments. The findings support the inference that the fully immersive 3D enriched-environment requires allocation of more brain and sensory resources for cognitive/motor control during both tasks than 2D presentations. This is further evidence that 3D VR tasks using EEG may be a promising approach for performance enhancement and potential applications in clinical/rehabilitation settings. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","2D versus 3D immersion; EEG theta power; Virtual reality","Adkin, A., Quant, S., Maki, B., McIlroy, W., Cortical responses associated with predictable and unpredictable compensatory balance reactions (2006) Exp.

Using value theory, this paper aims to assess the experiential brand value of real-life brands that have moved to the Virtual World of Second Life. A key premise is that current brand offerings in Virtual Worlds do not offer consumers adequate experiential value. The results demonstrate both the validity of an axiological approach to examining brand value, and highlight significant problems in consumer perceptions of the experiential value of brands within the Virtual World. A key finding is the difficulty in creating emotional brand value in Second Life which has serious implications for the sustainability of current real-life brands in Virtual Worlds.

This research proposes a framework of virtual testing based on statistical inference for new product development comprising of three successive steps: (i) statistical model calibration, (ii) hypothesis test for validity check and (iii) virtual qualification. Statistical model calibration first improves the predictive capability of a computational model in a calibration domain. Next, the hypothesis test is performed with limited observed data to see if a calibrated model is sufficiently predictive for virtual testing of a new product design. An area metric and the u-pooling method are employed for the hypothesis test to measure the degree of mismatch between predicted and observed results while considering statistical uncertainty in the area metric due to the lack of experimental data. Once the calibrated model becomes valid, the virtual qualification process can be executed with a qualified model for new product developments. The qualification process builds a design decision matrix to aid in rational decision-making for product design alternatives. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through the case study of a tire tread block. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Model calibration; Model validation; Validity check; Virtual qualification","AIAA, P.T.C., Guide for the verification and validation of computational fluid dynamic simulations (1998) AIAA Guide; ASME, P.T.C., Guide for verification and validation in computational solid mechanics, ASME (2006) New York; Babuska, I., Oden, J.T., Verification and validation in computational engineering and science: basic concepts (2004) Comput Methods Appl Mech, 193 (36-38), pp. 4057-4066; Campbell, K., Statistical calibration of computer simulations (2006) Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 91 (10-11), pp. 1358-1363; Chen, W., Tsui, K., Wang, S., A design-driven validation approach using Bayesian prediction models (2008) J Mech Des, 140 (2), p. 021101; Chen, W., Baghdasaryan, L., Buranathiti, T., Cao, J., Model validation via uncertainty propagation (2004) AIAA J, 42, pp. 1406-1415; Cho, J.C., Jung, B.C., Prediction of tread pattern wear by an explicit finite element model (2007) Tire Sci Technol, 35 (4), pp. 276-299; Choi, J.H., Lee, W.H., Park, J.J., Youn, B.D., A study on robust design optimization of layered plate bonding process considering uncertainties (2008) Struct Multidiscip Optim, 35 (6), pp. 531-540; Datta, B.N., Finite element model updating and partial eigenvalue assignment in structural dynamics: recent developments on computational methods (2005) Math Model Anal, pp. 15-27; Ferson, S., Oberkampf, W.L., Ginzburg, L., Model validation and predictive capability for the thermal challenge problem (2008) Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng, 197 (29-32), pp. 2408-2430; Higdon, D., Nakhleh, C., Gattiker, J., Williams, B., A Bayesian calibration approach to the thermal problem (2008) Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng, 197 (29-32), pp. 2431-2441; Hills, R.G., Truncano, T.G., (2002) Statistical validation of engineering and scientific models: a maximum likelihood based metric, SAND2001–1783, , Sandia National Labs, Albuquerque:; Hofstetter, K., Grohs, C., Eberhardsteiner, J., Mang, H.A., Sliding behaviour of simplified tire tread patterns investigated by means of FEM (2006) Comput Struct, 84 (17-18), pp. 1151-1163; Jung, B.C., Lee, D., Youn, B.D., Optimal design of constrained-layer damping structures considering material and operational condition variability (2009) AIAA J, 47 (12), pp. 2985-2995; Kennedy, M.C., O’Hagan, A., Bayesian calibration of computer models (2002) J R Stat Soc Ser B, 63 (3), pp. 425-464; Kennedy, M.C., O’Hagan, A., Bayesian calibration of computer models (2001) J R Stat Soc, 63, pp. 425-464; Liu, F., Bayarri, M.J., Berger, J.O., Paulo, R., Sacks, J., A Bayesian analysis of the thermal challenge problem (2008) Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng, 197 (29-32), pp. 2457-2466; Modarres, M., (1999) Kaminskiy, , M., and Krivtsov, V: Reliability engineering and risk analysis; a practical guide, CRC Press; Oberkampf, W.L., Trucano, T.G., Hirsch, C., Verification, validation, and predictive capability in computational engineering and physics (2004) Appl Mech Rev, 57, p. 345; Oberkampf, W.L., Barone, M.F., Measures of agreement between computation and experiment: validation metrics (2006) J Comput Phys, 217, pp. 5-36; Roache, P.J., Verification of codes and calculations (1998) AIAA J, 36 (5), pp. 696-702; Thacker, B.H., Doebling, S.W., Hemez, F.M., Anderson, M.C., Pepin, J.E., Rodriguez, E.A., (2004) Concepts of model verification and validation, Technical report, LA-14167, , Los Alamos National Lab, Los Alamos:; Trucano, T.G., Swiler, L.P., Igusa, T., Oberkampf, W.L., Pilch, M., Calibration, validation, and sensitivity analysis: what’s what (2006) Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 91 (10-11), pp. 1331-1357; Xi, Z., Hu, C., Youn, B.D., A comparative study of probability estimation methods for reliability analysis (2012) Struct Multidiscip Optim, 45 (1), pp. 33-52; Xiong, Y., Chen, W., Tsui, K., Apley, D.W., A better understanding of model updating strategies in validating engineering models (2009) Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng, 198 (15-16), pp. 1327-1337; Youn, B.D., Xi, Z., Wang, P., Eigenvector dimension reduction (EDR) method for sensitivity-free probability analysis (2008) Struct Multidiscip Optim, 37 (1), pp. 13-28; Youn, B.D., Jung, B.C., Xi, Z.M., Kim, S.B., Lee, W.R., A hierarchical framework for statistical model calibration in engineering product development (2011) Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng, 200, pp. 1421-1431; Wang, P., Youn, B.D., Xi, Z., Kloess, A., Bayesian reliability analysis with evolving, insufficient, and subjective data sets (2009) J Mech Des 131(11); Zhang, R., Mahadevan, S., Bayesian methodology for reliability model acceptance (2003) Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 80, pp. 95-103",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928259373

The technology enables users to naturally and intuitively manipulate objects and navigate in 3D space. The zSpace virtual holography platform is described. The platform provides a 3D display and head-tracking technology that transforms PCs into virtual-holographic computing facility using a stereoscopic user interface with an interactive stylus. The major components of the platform and its potential benefits, along with some of the current applications are briefly described. The use of the zSpace platform to explore and manipulate a number of space system models is outlined. The models considered include Titan Saturn system, a joint NASA/ESA mission; Mars Science Lab concept; James Webb Telescope; and a Lunar Lander concept. In each of the applications considered, the platform is enhanced by using multimodal interactions, and providing support for multiuser collaboration. The multimodal interactions, which enable more engaging, enhanced accessibility, are achieved by fusing information from a set of stylus input, 3D gestures, and neural input. Simultaneous and collaborative multiuser interactions are described, which support both local and distributed teams, using variety of displays.

A major challenge is the embedding problem of mapping virtual networks (VNs) onto PIP infrastructure. In the literature, a good deal of research has focused on providing heuristic approaches to this NP-hard problem, usually with the assumption that the PIP infrastructure is operational at all times. In virtualization environment, a single physical node/link failure can result in one or more logical link failures as it effects all VNs with a mapping that spans over. Setting up a dedicated backup for each VN embedding that is not shared with others is an inefficient use of resources. To address these concerns, this paper proposes two classes of periodic VN protection against link and node failures: (a) in the physical layer, by using a path or segment $p$ -cycle technique and a column generation optimization model, and (b) in the VN layer, by augmenting the topology with redundant resources and subsequently applying a column generation mapping model. Our simulations show a clear advantage of our approaches over benchmarks in terms of PIP profit, backup cost/rate and resource use. © 1968-2012 IEEE.","Column generation; Embedding; Fault-tolerance; Integer linear programming; Logical link failure; Logical protection; P-cycle; Physical link failure; Physical node failure; Physical protection; Virtual network","Chowdhury, M., Boutaba, R., A Survey of Network Virtualization (2010) Computer Networks, 54 (5), pp. 862-876. , Apr; Baucke, S., Virtualization Approach: Concept, 4WARD Project (2009) Deliverable 3.1.0; Carapinha, J., Jimenez, J., Network Virtualization-A View from the Bottom (2009) Proc.

The superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) is the primary white matter tract connecting lateral frontal with lateral parietal regions; it is distinct from the arcuate fasciculus, which interconnects the frontal and temporal lobes. Here we report a direct, quantitative comparison of SLF connectivity using virtual in vivo dissection of the SLF in chimpanzees and humans. SLF I, the superior-most branch of the SLF, showed similar patterns of connectivity between humans and chimpanzees, and was proportionally volumetrically larger in chimpanzees. SLF II, the middle branch, and SLF III, the inferior-most branch, showed species differences in frontal connectivity. In humans, SLF II showed greater connectivity with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas in chimps SLF II showed greater connectivity with the inferior frontal gyrus. SLF III was right-lateralized and proportionally volumetrically larger in humans, and human SLF III showed relatively reduced connectivity with dorsal premotor cortex and greater extension into the anterior inferior frontal gyrus, especially in the right hemisphere. These results have implications for the evolution of fronto-parietal functions including spatial attention to observed actions, social learning, and tool use, and are in line with previous research suggesting a unique role for the right anterior inferior frontal gyrus in the evolution of human fronto-parietal network architecture. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Cerebral asymmetry; Diffusion tensor imaging; Evolution; Laterality; Tractography; White matter","Andersson, J.L.R., Jenkinson, M., Smith, S., (2007) Non-linear Optimisation: FMRIB Technical Report, , www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/analysis/techrep, (TR07JA1 from; Aron, A.R., Robbins, T.W., Poldrack, R.A., Inhibition and the right inferior frontal cortex (2004) Trends Cogn.

Herein, hierarchical structure-based virtual screening against the sphingosine kinase 1(SphK1) binding pocket was performed. Consequently, three compounds have been identified as dual inhibitors of SphK1 and SphK2. Among them, compound 25 exhibited comparable SphK1 and SphK2 inhibitory activities to the positive control N,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS) 1, and exerted anti-proliferative effects on U937 cells. Furthermore, molecule dynamic (MD) simulations have been conducted to provide a more detailed insight into the binding model between SphK1 and 25 in a state close to physiological conditions. 25 may serve as a potential novel scaffold for further development of SphK1 inhibitors.

The aim of this study is to find out the best electrical configuration by analyzing annual energy generation of the same BIPV system, in terms of nominal power, without changing physical locations of the PV modules in the PV arrays. For this purpose, the spatial structure of the PV system including the PV modules and the surrounding obstacles is taken into account on the basis of virtual reality environment. In this study, chimneys which are located on the residential roof-top area are considered to create the effect of shading over the PV array. The locations of PV modules are kept stationary, which is the main point of this paper, while comparing the performances of the configurations with the same surrounding obstacles that causes partial shading conditions. The same spatial structure with twelve distinct PV array configurations is considered. The same settling conditions on the roof-top area allow fair comparisons between PV array configurations. The payback time analysis is also performed with considering local and global maximum power points (MPPs) of PV arrays by comparing the annual energy yield of the different configurations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","BIPV systems; Partial shading; Payback time; PV configurations; Virtual reality","Kadri, R., Andrei, H., Gaubert, J.P., Ivanovici, T., Champenois, G., Andrei, P., Modeling of the photovoltaic cell circuit parameters for optimum connection model and real-time emulator with partial shadowing conditions (2012) Energy, 42, pp. 57-67; Chouder, A., Silvestre, S., Taghezouit, B., Karatepe, E., Monitoring, modeling and simulation of PV systems using LabVIEW (2013) Sol Energy, 91, pp. 337-349; Thevenard, D., Pelland, S., Estimating the uncertainty in long-term photovoltaic yield predictions (2013) Sol Energy, 91, pp. 432-445; Hossein, M., Keyhani, A., Mobli, H., Abrinia, K., Sharifi, A., Areview of principle and sun-tracking methods for maximizing solar systems output (2009) Renew Sust Energy Rev, 13, pp. 1800-1818; Syafaruddin, K.E., Hiyama, T., Performance enhancement of photovoltaic array through string and central based MPPT system under non-uniform irradiance conditions (2012) Energy Convers Manag, 62, pp. 131-140; Karatepe, E., Hiyama, T., Boztepe, M., Colak, M., Voltage based power compensation system for photovoltaic system generation under shaded insolation conditions (2008) Energy Convers Manag, 49, pp. 2307-2316; Chowdhury, S.R., Saha, H., Maximum power point tracking of partially shaded solar photovoltaic arrays (2010) Sol Energy Mater Sol C, 94, pp. 1441-1447; Koutroulis, E., Blaabjerg, F., A new technique for tracking the global maximum power point of PV arrays operating under-partial shading conditions IEEE J Photovolt., , doi:10.1109/JPHOTOV.2012.2183578; Miyatake, M., Veerachary, M., Toriumi, F., Fujii, N., Ko, H., Maximum power point tracking of multiple photovoltaic arrays: a PSO approach (2011) IEEE Trans Aero Electron Syst, 47 (1); Loulas, N.M., Karteris, M.M., Pilavachi, P.A., Papadopoulos, A.M., Photovoltaics in urban environment: a case study for typical apartment buildings in Greece (2012) Renew Energy, 48, pp. 453-463; Strzalka, A., Alam, N., Duminil, E., Coors, V., Eicker, U., Large scale integration of photovoltaic in cities (2012) Appl Energy, 93, pp. 413-421; Wang, Y.J., Hsu, P.C., An investigation on partial shading of PV modules with different connection configurations of PV cells (2011) Energy, 36, pp. 3069-3078; Karatepe, E., Syafaruddin, H.T., Simple and high-efficiency photovoltaic system under non-uniform operating conditions (2010) IET Renew Power Gen, 4, pp. 354-368; Rani, B.I., Ilango, G.S., Nagamani, C., Enhanced power generation from PV array under partial shading conditions by shade dispersion using Su Do Ku configuration (2012) IEEE Trans Sust Energy; Celik, B., Karatepe, E., Gokmen, N., Silvestre, S., Avirtual reality study of surrounding obstacles on BIPV systems for estimation of long-term performance of partially shaded PV arrays (2013) Renew Energy, 60, pp. 402-414; (1993) Handbook of fundamentals, , Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers, American Society of Heating, Atlanta; Karatepe, E., Boztepe, M., Çolak, M., Development of a suitable model for characterizing photovoltaic arrays with shaded solar cells (2007) Sol Energy, 81, pp. 1977-1992; Silvestre, S., Boronat, A., Chouder, A., Study of bypass diodes configuration on PV modules (2009) Appl Energy, 86, pp. 1632-1640; Soler-Bientz, R., Gòmez-Castro, F., Omar-Ricalde, L., Developing a computational tool to assess shadow pattern on a horizontal plane, preliminary results 35th IEEE photovoltaic specialists conference 20-25 June 2010, , Hawaii, USA; Lazou, A.A., Papatsoris, A.D., The economics of photovoltaic stand-alone residential households: a case study for various European and Mediterranean locations (2000) Sol Energy Mater Sol C, 62, pp. 411-427; Ordenes, M., Marioski, D.L., Braun, P., Rüther, R., The impact of building-integrated photovoltaics on the energy demand of multi-family dwelling in Brazil (2007) Energy Build, 39, pp. 629-642; Hwang, T., Kang, S., Kim, J.T., Optimization of the building integrated photovoltaic system in office buildings-Focus on the orientation, inclined angle and installed area (2012) Energy Build, 46, pp. 92-104; Lu, L., Yang, H.X., Environmental payback time analysis of a roof-mounted building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system in Hong Kong (2010) Appl Energy, 87, pp. 3625-3631",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910024216

The Parallel Distributed Processing model (PDPM) postulates that responding to (RJA) and initiating (IJA) joint attention are predominantly supported by posterior-parietal and frontal regions respectively. It also argues that these neural networks integrate during development, supporting the parallel processes of self- and other-attention representation during interactions. However, direct evidence for the PDPM is limited due to a lack of ecologically valid experimental paradigms that can capture both RJA and IJA. Building on existing interactive approaches, we developed a virtual reality paradigm where participants engaged in an online interaction to complete a cooperative task. By including tightly controlled baseline conditions to remove activity associated with non-social task demands, we were able to directly contrast the neural correlates of RJA and IJA to determine whether these processes are supported by common brain regions. Both RJA and IJA activated broad frontotemporoparietal networks. Critically, a conjunction analysis identified that a subset of these regions were common to both RJA and IJA. This right-lateralised network included the dorsal portion of the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), middle temporal gyrus (MTG), precentral gyrus, posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and precuneus. Additional activation was observed in this network for IJA relative to RJA at MFG, IFG, TPJ and precuneus. This is the first imaging study to directly investigate the neural correlates common to RJA and IJA engagement, and thus support the assumption that a broad integrated network underlies the parallel aspects of both initiating and responding to joint attention. © 2014.","Eye tracking; FMRI; Interaction; Joint attention; Social cognition; Virtual reality","Amodio, D.M., Frith, C.D., Meeting of minds: the medial frontal cortex and social cognition (2006) Nat.

More specifically, it is difficult to achieve a fast enough graphic update rate (at least 30 Hz) on commodity PC hardware by utilizing traditional triangle-based rendering algorithms. In recent years, point-based rendering (PBR) has been shown to offer the potential to outperform the traditional triangle-based rendering in speed when it is applied to highly complex soft tissue cutting models. Nevertheless, the PBR algorithms are still limited in visual quality due to inherent contrast distortion. We propose an adaptive image contrast enhancement algorithm as a postprocessing module for PBR, providing high visual rendering quality as well as acceptable rendering efficiency. Our approach is based on a perceptible image quality technique with automatic parameter selection, resulting in a visual quality comparable to existing conventional PBR algorithms. Experimental results show that our adaptive image contrast enhancement algorithm produces encouraging results both visually and numerically compared to representative algorithms, and experiments conducted on the latest hardware demonstrate that the proposed PBR framework with the postprocessing module is superior to the conventional PBR algorithm and that the proposed contrast enhancement algorithm can be utilized in (or compatible with) various variants of the conventional PBR algorithm. © 2015 SPIE and IS & T.","adaptive contrast enhancement; Automatic parameter selection; contrast distortion; perceptual features; point-based rendering","Courtecuisse, H., Real-time simulation of contact and cutting of heterogeneous soft-tissues (2014) Med.

However, as robotic systems are increasingly becoming sophisticated and are performing more complex tasks, realizing these benefits requires new approaches to teleoperation. This paper introduces a novel haptic mediator interface for teleoperating mobile robotic platforms that have a variety of manipulators and functions. Identical master-slave bilateral teleoperation of the robotic manipulators is achieved by representing them in virtual reality and by allowing the operator to interact with them using a multipoint haptic device. The operator is also able to command motions to the mobile platform by using a novel haptic interaction metaphor rather than a separate dedicated input device. The presented interaction techniques enable the operator to perform a wide range of control functions and achieve functionality similar to that of conventional teleoperation schemes that use a single haptic interface. The mediator interface is presented, and important considerations such as workspace mapping and scaling are discussed. © 2015 IEEE.","Bilateral teleoperation; haptic grasping; mediator interface; mobile robotics","Imaida, T., Yokokohji, Y., Doi, T., Oda, M., Yoshikwa, T., Ground-space bilateral teleoperation experiment using Ets-Vii robot arm with direct kinesthetic coupling (2001) Proc.

During the last decade, with the boom of dedicated music players and mobile phones, the everyday use of light headphones has become highly popular. Current headphones are also paving the way for more sophisticated assisted listening devices. Today, active noise control (ANC), equalization techniques, and a hear-through function are already a standard part of many headphones that people commonly use while traveling. It is not difficult to predict that, in the near future, a headset will be a ?hearing aid for those with normal hearing,? which can improve listening conditions for example in a noisy environment. © 2014 IEEE.",,"White, J., Schmidt, D.C., Golparvar-Fard, M., Applications of augmented reality (2014) Proc.

All the molecules satisfied Lipinski's rule of five confirming their oral bioavailability. They also show good bioactivity score for protease and enzyme inhibition. ADME/Tox studies conducted shows that almost all the derivatives are free from toxicity risks. It is observed that these molecules exhibit fairly good drug score and are orally viable molecules.

Because most of the build time for Java projects is spent executing tests, researchers have focused on speeding up testing. They've integrated two complementary approaches into a system that seamlessly supports Ant and Maven JUnit build processes. The first approach, unit test virtualization, isolates in-memory dependencies among test cases, which otherwise are isolated inefficiently by restarting the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) before every test. The system supports just-in-time reinitialization of only the small portion of memory needed by the next test, reusing a single JVM. The implementation of this approach is called VMVM (Virtual Machine in the Virtual Machine, pronounced 'vroom vroom'). In addition, simple setup and tear-down resource management methods designed for sequential execution lead to conflicts when the resources are accessed concurrently. So, the second approach, virtualized unit test virtualization, isolates external dependencies such as files and network ports while long-running tests execute in parallel. For this, the system distributes testing jobs in round-robin manner among OS-level virtual machines. The result is, on average, a 51 percent speedup of application build times. The implementation of this approach is called VMVMVM (Virtual Machine in a Virtual Machine on a Virtual Machine 'vroom vroom vroom'). © 2015 IEEE.","software engineering; test execution; testing tools","Yoo, S., Harman, M., Regression testing minimization, selection and prioritization: A survey (2012) Software Testing, Verification and Reliability, 22 (2), pp. 67-120; Rothermel, G., Harrold, M.J., Analyzing regression test selection techniques (1996) IEEE Trans.

In this context, augmented reality (AR) is one of the most suitable solutions. However, it is still not ready to be effectively used in industry. A crucial problem is the legibility of text seen through AR head-worn displays (HWDs). AR interface designers have no standard guidelines to follow, especially for these devices. Literature and anecdotal evidence suggest that legibility depends mainly on background, display technology (that is, see-through optical or video HWDs), and text style (for example, plain text, outline, or billboard). Furthermore, there are constraints to consider in industrial environments, such as standard color-coding practices and workplace lighting. The authors examine aspects affecting text legibility with an emphasis on deriving guidelines to support AR interface designers. Their results suggest that enhancing text contrast via software, along with using the outline or billboard style, is an effective practice to improve legibility in many situations. If one text style is needed for both types of HWD, their results suggest that colored billboards (with neutral white text) are effective. When color coding is not mandatory, white text and blue billboard are more effective than other styles tested. © 1981-2012 IEEE.","augmented reality; computer graphics; head-worn displays; human-computer interface; Industrie 4.0; mixed reality; style guides; usability engineering; vision I/O","Fite-Georgel, P., Is There a Reality in Industrial Augmented Reality Proc. 10th IEEE Int'l Symp.

Industrial operators are important barriers against accidents. Distributed Situation Awareness (DSA) has been shown to correlate with positive performance and goal achievement. The role of individual operators as barriers against accidents calls for a greater understanding of DSA in the process industry and industrial plants. Industrial operators must cope with uncertainties with regards to the information they must process in normal and abnormal situations, while working in geographically dispersed locations and with different teams. The significance of DSA during an abnormal situation increases manifold and influences the possible consequences of an accident scenario. Aim of this article is to consider the effect of two distinct training methods on DSA and safety-related performance of industrial operators during an accident scenario. The results show that participants trained with the help of 3D virtual environments (N=12) were able to maintain better DSA and performed effectively within a simulated scenario as compared to those (N=12) trained with a conventional training method. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Industrial safety; Plant operators; Plant simulator; Training methods; Virtual environments","Aggarwal, R., Black, S.A., Hance, J.R., Darzi, A., Cheshire, N.J.W., Virtual reality simulation training can improve inexperienced surgeons' endovascular skills (2006) Eur.

Although it facilitates improved utilization of resources, virtualization can lead to performance degradation due to the sharing of physical resources like CPU, memory, network interfaces, disk controllers, etc. Multi-tenancy can cause highly unpredictable performance for concurrent I/O applications running inside virtual machines that share local disk storage in Cloud. Disk I/O requests in a typical Cloud setup may have varied requirements in terms of latency and throughput as they arise from a range of heterogeneous applications having diverse performance goals. This necessitates providing differential performance services to different I/O applications. In this paper, we present PriDyn, a novel scheduling framework which is designed to consider I/O performance metrics of applications such as acceptable latency and convert them to an appropriate priority value for disk access based on the current system state. This framework aims to provide differentiated I/O service to various applications and ensures predictable performance for critical applications in multi-tenant Cloud environment. We demonstrate through experimental validations on real world I/O traces that this framework achieves appreciable enhancements in I/O performance, indicating that this approach is a promising step towards enabling QoS guarantees on Cloud storage. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","differentiated service; disk scheduling; multi-tenancy; QoS; Virtualization","Beloglazov, A., Buyya, R., Energy efficient resource management in virtualized cloud data centers Proc. 10th IEEE/ACM Int.

Specifically, we proposed a simple but effective EGT (Evolutionary Game Theory)-based mechanism, VPEF (Voluntary Principle and round-based Entry Fee), to drive the networking environment into cooperative. VPEF builds incentive mechanism as two simple system rules: The first is VP meaning that all behaviors are voluntarily conducted by users: Users voluntarily participate (after paying round-based entry fee), voluntarily contribute resource, and voluntarily punish other defectors (incurring extra cost to those so-called punishers); The second is EF meaning that an arbitrarily small round-based entry fee is set for each user who wants to participate in the community. We presented a generic analytical framework of evolutionary dynamics to model VPEF scheme, and theoretically proved that VPEF scheme's efficiency loss defined as the ratio of system time, in which no users will provide resource, is 4/(8 + M). M is the number of users in community-based collaborative system. Finally, the simulated results using content availability as an example verified our theoretical analysis. © 2015 IEEE.","Community-based autonomous networks; Entry fee; Evolutionary game theory; Incentive mechanism; Voluntary principle","Plagemann, T., Canonico, R., Domingo-Pascual, J., Guerrero, C., Mauthe, A., Infrastructures for community networks (2008) Content Delivery Networks, , R.

To support high-quality Video-on-Demand (VoD) in mobile wireless networks, using virtual community-based approaches to balance the efficiency of content sharing and maintenance cost of performance-aware solutions has attracted increasing research interest. In this paper, we propose a novel Performance-aware Mobile Community-based VoD streaming solution over vehicular ad hoc networks (PMCV). PMCV relies on a newly designed mobile community detection scheme and an innovative community member management mechanism. The former employs a novel fuzzy ant-inspired clustering algorithm and an innovative mobility similarity estimation model to group together the mobile users with similar behavior in terms of playback and movement into mobile communities. The latter introduces the role and task of members, member join and leave, collaborative store and search for resources, and replacement of a broker member. Simulation-based testing shows how PMCV outperforms another state-of-the-art solution in terms of performance. © 2014 IEEE.","Mobile community; vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs); Video-on-Demand (VoD) st","Taleb, T., A stable routing protocol to support its services in VANET networks (2007) IEEE Trans.
