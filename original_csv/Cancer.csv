However, about 10% of EGFR wild type (wt) patients respond to TKI, with unknown molecular mechanisms of sensitivity. We considered a case series of 34 EGFR wt NSCLC patients responsive to erlotinib after at least one line of therapy. Responsive patients were matched with an equal number of non-responsive EGFR wt patients. A panel of 26 genes, for a total of 214 somatic mutations, was analyzed by MassARRAY® System (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA). A 15% KRAS mutation was observed in both groups, with a prevalence of G12C in non-responders (80% vs. 40% in responders). NOTCH1, p53 and EGFR-resistance-related mutations were found more frequently in non-responders, whereas EGFR-sensitizing mutations and alterations in genes involved in proliferation pathways were more frequent in responders. In conclusion, our findings indicate that p53, NOTCH1 and exon 20 EGFR mutations seem to be related to TKI resistance. KRAS mutations do not appear to influence the TKI response, although G12C mutation is more frequent in non-responders. Finally, the use of highly sensitive methodologies could lead to the identification of under-represented EGFR mutations potentially associated with TKI sensitivity. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","EGFR wt; Endoplasmic reticulum stress; KRAS; NSCLC; p53","Mok, T.S., Wu, Y.L., Thongprasert, S., Yang, C.H., Chu, D.T., Saijo, N., Sunpaweravong, P., Ichinose, Y., Gefitinib or carboplatin-paclitaxel in pulmonary adenocarcinoma (2009) N.

The diagnostic value of AZGP1 in serum of prostate and breast cancer patients has been reported. Analyzing “The Cancer Genome Atlas” data, we found that in colon cancer AZGP1 gene expression was upregulated at transcriptional level. We hypothesized that AZGP1 could be used as a diagnostic marker of colon cancer. First, we confirmed AZGP1 expression was higher in a set of 28 tumor tissues than in normal colonic mucosa tissues by real-time quantitative PCR and western blot in a Chinese population. We verified that serum concentration of AZGP1 was higher in 120 colon cancer patients compared with 40 healthy controls by ELISA (p < 0.001). Then receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the predictive diagnostic value of AZGP1 in serum. The area under the curve (AUC) of AZGP1 was 0.742 (p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.656–0.827) in between the AUC of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and the AUC of CA19-9, suggesting that predictive diagnostic value of AZGP1 is between CEA and Carbohydrate 19-9 (CA19-9). The combination of AZGP1 with traditional serum biomarkers, CEA and CA19-9, could result in better diagnostic results. To further validate the diagnostic value of AZGP1, a tissue microarray containing 190 samples of primary colon cancer tissue paired with normal colonic tissue was analysed and the result showed that AZGP1 was significantly upregulated in 68.4% (130 of 190) of the primary cancer lesions. In contrast, there was a weakly positive staining in 29.5% (56 of 190) of the normal colonic tissue samples (p < 0.001). Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed on the serum data, and showed that the diagnostic value of AZGP1 had 63.3% sensitivity and 65.0% specificity. Combination of AZGP1, CEA and CA19-9 had improved diagnosis value accuracy with 74.2% sensitivity and 72.5% specificity. These results suggest that AZGP1 is a useful diagnostic biomarker in tissues and serum from a Chinese population. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","AZGP1 protein; Clinical marker; Colon cancer; Human; Tissue array analysis","Nelson, R.S., Thorson, A.G., Colorectal cancer screening (2009) Curr.

We examined the relationship among 5-MeC levels, DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) immunostaining levels, and clinicopathologic features. Tissue samples included 23 normal urothelia and 150 urothelial neoplasia, which comprised 40 non-invasive and 110 invasive UCs. The levels of 5-MeC and DNMT1 were assessed based on their immunoreactivities and then divided into low and high levels. In addition, we collected information on clinical variables, pathologic features, and recurrent status from patient questionnaires and medical records. Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression model were used for analyses. Results showed that 5-MeC levels were positively associated with DNMT1 levels in UC (p = 0.0288). Both 5-MeC and DNMT1 were low in approximately 50% (76/150) of UC. The percentage of low 5-MeC levels was higher in invasive UC (65/110; 59%) than in normal urothelia (2/23; 13%) and non-invasive UC (18/40; 45%). Clinical factors were independently associated with low 5-MeC levels after adjusting for age and sex, including cancer stages II–IV, presence of UC in situ, and marked inflammation. Low 5-MeC levels in stage I invasive UC were not significantly different from those of non-invasive tumors (p = 0.8478). Low DNMT1 levels were only associated with UC with squamous differentiation (p = 0.0365). Neither 5-MeC nor DNMT1 levels were associated with UC recurrence.

In many breast cancers, estrogen, progesterone and epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cells proliferate in response to growth factors and growth factor antagonists are a mainstay of treatment. However, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells lack receptor expression, are frequently more aggressive and are resistant to growth factor inhibition. Downstream of growth factor receptors, signal transduction proceeds via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3k), Akt and FOXO3a inhibition, the latter being partly responsible for coordinated increases in glycolysis and apoptosis resistance. FOXO3a may be an attractive therapeutic target for TNBC. Therefore we have undertaken a systematic review of FOXO3a as a target for breast cancer therapeutics. Methods: Articles from NCBI were retrieved systematically when reporting primary data about FOXO3a expression in breast cancer cells after cytotoxic drug treatment. Results: Increased FOXO3a expression is common following cytotoxic drug treatment and is associated with apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. There is some evidence that metabolic enzyme expression is also altered and that this effect is also elicited in TNBC cells. FOXO3a expression serves as a positive prognostic marker, especially in estrogen (ER) receptor positive cells. Discussion: FOXO3a is upregulated by a number of receptor-dependent and -independent anti-cancer drugs and associates with apoptosis. The identification of microRNA that regulate FOXO3a directly suggest that it offers a tangible therapeutic target that merits wider evaluation. © Taylor et al.","Apoptosis; Glycolysis; Metabolism; Oxidative stress; Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Triple negative breast cancer","Andre, F., Zielinski, C.C., Optimal strategies for the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer with currently approved agents (2012) Ann Oncol, 23, pp. 646-651; Berrada, N., Delaloge, S., Andre, F., Treatment of triple-negative metastatic breast cancer: toward individualized targeted treatments or chemosensitization?

Five new agents that prolong survival in this group have emerged in the past 5 years, and sipuleucel-T is among them. Sipuleucel-T is the only immunotherapy shown to improve survival in prostate cancer. It is currently indicated in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients, as it has never shown a direct cancer effect. This paper describes the process of creating the sipuleucel-T product from the manufacturing and patient aspects. It discusses the four placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of sipuleucel-T, focusing on survival and adverse events. There are three RCTs in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, all of which showed improved overall survival without meaningful decreases in symptoms, tumor volumes, or prostate-specific antigen levels. One RCT in castration-sensitive, biochemically relapsed prostate cancer attempted to find a decrease in biochemical failure, but that endpoint was not reached. Adverse events in all four of these studies centered around cytokine release. This paper also reviews a Phase II study of sipuleucel-T given neoadjuvantly that speaks to its mechanism of action. Additionally, there is a registry study of sipuleucel-T that has been used to evaluate immunological parameters of the product in men ≥80 years of age and men who had previously been treated with palliative radiation.

Because of high throughput of gene expression data for healthy and patient samples, a variable selection method can be applied to reduce complexity of the model and improve the classification performance. Since variable selection procedures pose a risk of over-fitting, when a large number of variables with respect to sample are used, we have proposed a method for coupling data dimension reduction and variable selection in the present study. This approach uses the concept of variable clustering for the original data set. Significant components of local principal component analysis models have just been retained from all clusters. Then, the variable selection algorithm is performed on these locally derived principal component variables. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on two gene expression data sets; namely, acute Leukemia and small round blue-cell tumor (SRBCT). Our results confirmed that the classification models achieved on the reduced data were better than those obtained on the entire microarray gene expression profile. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Clustering of variable; Genetic algorithm; Kohonen self-organizing map; Linear discriminant analysis; Microarray gene expression","Whelehan, O.P., Earll, M.E., Johansson, E., Toft, M., Eriksson, L., Detection of ovarian cancer using chemometric analysis of proteomic profiles (2006) Chemometr.

Therefore, targeting these features may improve the response to cancer therapy. In this study, we provided direct evidence that the α-tocopherol derivative ESeroS-GS inhibited the viability, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells. ESeroS-GS induced cell death in different cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner but showed no significant effects on MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells. Although the ESeroS-GS-induced cell death in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was accompanied with the generation of reactive oxygen species and the down regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), no such effect on reactive oxygen species and MMP was seen in MCF-10A cells. Further studies indicated that ESeroS-GS down-regulated the expression of hexokinase II, SDH B, UQCRC2 and COX II in MDA-MB-231 cells but not in MCF-10A cells. The down-regulation of these enzymes accounts for the decreased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis in MDA-MB-231cells upon ESeroS-GS treatment. We also found that sub-toxic concentration of ESeroS-GS treatment resulted in the impairment of F-actin cytoskeleton assembly and the consequently decreased migratory and invasive ability of MDA-MB-231 cells, which might be due to the inhibition of cellular energy metabolism. These results indicate that ESeroS-GS shows potential to become a novel anti-cancer agent by targeting the energy metabolism of cancer cells. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Drug access to brain metastases and normal brain is key to management of cranial disease. In this study, positron emission tomography (PET) scanning after administration of radiolabelled lapatinib was used to obtain direct evidence of cranial drug access. Methods: Patients with Her-2+ metastatic breast cancer either with at least one 1-cm diameter brain metastasis or without brain metastases underwent dynamic carbon-11 radiolabelled lapatinib ([11C]lapatinib)-PET. Less than 20 μg of [11C]lapatinib was administered before and after 8 days of oral lapatinib (1,500 mg once daily). Radial arterial blood sampling was performed throughout the 90-min scan. The contribution of blood volume activity to the tissue signal was excluded to calculate lapatinib uptake in normal brain and metastases. Partitioning of radioactivity between plasma and tissue (V<inf>T</inf>) was calculated and the tissue concentration of lapatinib derived. Plasma lapatinib levels were measured and adverse events noted. Results: Six patients (three with brain metastases) were recruited. About 80% plasma radioactivity corresponded to intact [11C]lapatinib after 60 min. PET signal in the brain corresponded to circulating radioactivity levels, with no [11C]lapatinib uptake observed in normal brain tissue. In contrast, radioactivity uptake in cranial metastases was significantly higher (p = 0.002) than that could be accounted by circulating radioactivity levels, consistent with [11C]lapatinib uptake in brain metastases. There was no difference in lapatinib uptake between the baseline and day 8 scans, suggesting no effect of increased drug access by inhibition of the drug efflux proteins by therapeutic doses of lapatinib. Conclusions: Increased lapatinib uptake was observed in brain metastases but not in normal brain.

The variation in the climate, the geographical location and the rich ethnomedicinal traditions has made the Darjeeling Himalayas an abode of invaluable repository of traditional medicinal plants. In this study, we explored the in vitro anticancer properties of traditionally used medicinal plants from the Darjeeling hills against different human cancer cell lines. Methods: The ethanolic leaf extracts of 30 medicinal plants were tested for their cytotoxicity against human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF 7), human hepatocarcinoma cell line (HepG2) and human cervix adenocarcinoma cell line (HeLa). The cytotoxicity was evaluated by performing MTT assay, trypan blue exclusion assay and morphological assessment under phase contrast inverted microscope. For the extracts which tested positive, IC50 (the concentration that inhibited cell growth by 50%) was calculated. The extract(s) were further subjected to Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) to determine their phytochemical profile. Results: Out of the 30 plant extracts tested, five plants, Artemisia indica, Eupatorium odoratum, Eupatorium adenophorum, Maesa macrophylla and Phlogacanthus thyrsiformis showed a &gt; 50% growth inhibition of cancer cell lines at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. The sensitivity to different extracts varied according to the cell type under investigation. Of these plants, Maesa macrophylla, exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity against HeLa and MCF7 cell with IC50 values of 9.55 μg/ml and 16.19 μg/ml respectively. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of coumarins, flavonoids, tannins, saponins, steroids and terpenes. Conclusions: This is perhaps the first report of screening of traditional medicinal plants from Darjeeling district in West Bengal, India, for their cytotoxic activity against three human cancerous cell lines MCF7, HeLa and HepG2. The extracts of Maesa macrophylla significantly inhibited the growth of HeLa and MCF7 cancerous cell lines and constituted of multiple known biologically active compounds. The present study may provide the landmark for further exploration of M. macrophylla for its potent anticancer constituents. © 2015 Tiwary et al.","Anticancer; Cytotoxicity; Darjeeling; Medicinal plants; Phytochemicals","Jemal, A., Siegel, R., Ward, E., Murray, T., Xu, J., Thun, M.J., Cancer statistics (2007) CA Cancer J Clin, 57, pp. 43-66; Ferlay, J., Shin, H.R., Bray, F., Forman, D., Mathers, C., Parkin, D., Estimates of worldwide burden of cancer in 2008: GLOBOCAN 2008 (2010) Int J Cancer, 127, pp. 2893-2917; Dikshit, R., Gupta, P.C., Ramasundarahettige, C., Gajalakshmi, V., Aleksandrowicz, L., Badwe, R., Cancer mortality in India: a nationally representative survey (2012) Lancet, 379, pp. 1807-1816; Ali, I., Wani, W.A., Saleem, K., Cancer scenario in India with future perspectives (2011) Canc Ther, 8, pp. 56-70; Gullett, N.P., Ruhul Amin, A.R., Bayraktar, S., Pezzuto, J.M., Shin, D.M., Khuri, F.R., Cancer prevention with natural compounds (2010) Semin Oncol, 37, pp. 258-281; Shah, U., Shah, R., Acharya, S., Acharya, N., Novel anticancer agents from plant sources (2013) Chin J Nat Med, 11 (1), pp. 16-23; Cragg, G.M., Newman, D.J., Plant as source of anticancer agents (2005) J Ethnopharmacol, 100, pp. 72-79; Cirla, A., Mann, J., Combrestatins: from natural product to drug discovery (2003) Nat Prod Rep, 20, pp. 558-564; Luduena, R.F., Multiple form of tubulin: different gene products and covalent modification (1998) Int Rev Cytology, 178 (13), pp. 207-275; Itokawa, H., Wang, X., Lee, K.-H., Homoharringtonine and related compounds.

Box 30.001,Groningen, Netherlands","Background: Deformable image registration allows volume of interest (VOI)- and voxel-based analysis of longitudinal changes in fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tumor uptake in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study evaluates the performance of the elastix toolbox deformable image registration algorithm for VOI and voxel-wise assessment of longitudinal variations in FDG tumor uptake in NSCLC patients. Methods: Evaluation of the elastix toolbox was performed using 18F-FDG PET/CT at baseline and after 2 cycles of therapy (follow-up) data in advanced NSCLC patients. The elastix toolbox, an integrated part of the IMALYTICS workstation, was used to apply a CT-based non-linear image registration of follow-up PET/CT data using the baseline PET/CT data as reference. Lesion statistics were compared to assess the impact on therapy response assessment. Next, CT-based deformable image registration was performed anew on the deformed follow-up PET/CT data using the original follow-up PET/CT data as reference, yielding a realigned follow-up PET dataset. Performance was evaluated by determining the correlation coefficient between original and realigned follow-up PET datasets. The intra- and extra-thoracic tumors were automatically delineated on the original PET using a 41% of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) adaptive threshold. Equivalence between reference and realigned images was tested (determining 95% range of the difference) and estimating the percentage of voxel values that fell within that range. Results: Thirty-nine patients with 191 tumor lesions were included. In 37/39 and 12/39 patients, respectively, thoracic and non-thoracic lesions were evaluable for response assessment. Using the EORTC/SUVmax-based criteria, 5/37 patients had a discordant response of thoracic, and 2/12 a discordant response of non-thoracic lesions between the reference and the realigned image. FDG uptake values of corresponding tumor voxels in the original and realigned reference PET correlated well (R2=0.98). Using equivalence testing, 94% of all the voxel values fell within the 95% range of the difference between original and realigned reference PET. Conclusions: The elastix toolbox impacts lesion statistics and therefore therapy response assessment in a clinically significant way. The elastix toolbox is therefore not applicable in its current form and/or standard settings for PET response evaluation. Further optimization and validation of this technique is necessary prior to clinical implementation. © 2015, Kerner et al.; licensee Springer.","Elastix; Image deformation; NSCLC; PET/CT","Eisenhauer, E.A., Therasse, P., Bogaerts, J., Schwartz, L.H., Sargent, D., Ford, R., New response evaluation criteria in solid tumours: revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1) (2009) Eur J Cancer., 45, pp. 228-247. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD1M%2Fgs12rug%3D%3D, PID: 19097774; Sunaga, N., Oriuchi, N., Kaira, K., Yanagitani, N., Tomizawa, Y., Hisada, T., Usefulness of FDG-PET for early prediction of the response to gefitinib in non-small cell lung cancer (2008) Lung Cancer., 59, pp. 203-210. , PID: 17913282; Kobe, C., Scheffler, M., Holstein, A., Zander, T., Nogova, L., Lammertsma, A.A., Predictive value of early and late residual 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 18 F-fluorothymidine uptake using different SUV measurements in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer treated with erlotinib (2012) Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging., 39, pp. 1117-1127. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38XosVWiu7k%3D, PID: 22526960; Tiseo, M., Ippolito, M., Scarlattei, M., Spadaro, P., Cosentino, S., Latteri, F., Predictive and prognostic value of early response assessment using 18FDG-PET in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with erlotinib (2014) Cancer Chemother Pharmacol., 73, pp. 299-307. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXhvValtrzL, PID: 24258456; Young, H., Baum, R., Cremerius, U., Herholz, K., Hoekstra, O., Lammertsma, A.A., Measurement of clinical and subclinical tumour response using [18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography: review and 1999 EORTC recommendations.

Box 700Helsinki, Finland","Majority of the known breast cancer susceptibility genes have a role in DNA repair and the most important high-risk genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are specifically involved in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA double-strand breaks. A central player in HRR is RAD51 that binds DNA at the damage site. The RAD51 paralogs RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3 facilitate the binding of RAD51 to DNA. While germline mutations in RAD51C and RAD51D are associated with high ovarian cancer risk and RAD51B polymorphisms with breast cancer, the contribution of RAD51, XRCC3, and XRCC2 is more unclear. To investigate the role of RAD51, XRCC3, and XRCC2 in breast cancer predisposition and to identify putative recurrent founder mutations in the Finnish population where such mutations have been observed in most of the currently known susceptibility genes, we screened 182 familial Finnish breast or ovarian cancer patients for germline variation in the RAD51and XRCC3 genes and 342 patients for variation in XRCC2, with a subset of the patients selected on the basis of decreased RAD51 protein expression on tumors. We also performed haplotype analyses for 1516 breast cancer cases and 1234 controls to assess the common variation in these genes. No pathogenic mutations were detected in any of the genes and the distribution of haplotypes was similar between cases and controls. Our results suggest that RAD51, XRCC3, and XRCC2 do not substantially contribute to breast cancer predisposition in the Finnish population. © 2015, Pelttari et al.; licensee Springer.","Breast cancer; RAD51; XRCC2; XRCC3","Antoniou, A.C., Sinilnikova, O.M., Simard, J., Léoné, M., Dumont, M., Neuhausen, S.L., Struewing, J.P., Gronwald, J., RAD51 135G → C modifies breast cancer risk among BRCA2 mutation carriers: results from a combined analysis of 19 studies (2007) Am J Hum Genet, 81, pp. 1186-1200; Bartkova, J., Tommiska, J., Oplustilova, L., Aaltonen, K., Tamminen, A., Heikkinen, T., Mistrik, M., Bartek, J., Aberrations of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 DNA damage sensor complex in human breast cancer: MRE11 as a candidate familial cancer-predisposing gene (2008) Mol Oncol, 2, pp. 296-316; Breast Cancer Association Consortium, Commonly studied single-nucleotide polymorphisms and breast cancer: results from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (2006) J Natl Cancer Inst, 98, pp. 1382-1396; Eerola, H., Blomqvist, C., Pukkala, E., Pyrhönen, S., Nevanlinna, H., Familial breast cancer in southern Finland: how prevalent are breast cancer families and can we trust the family history reported by patients?

We explored emergency clinicians’ attitudes to the ED environment when caring for patients who present with advanced cancer, and how these attitudes are affected by access to palliative care services, palliative care education, staff type, ED experience and patient demographic, hospital type and region. Methods: We electronically surveyed clinicians from the College of Emergency Nursing Australasia, Australian College of Emergency Nursing and Australasian College for Emergency Medicine working in an Australian ED.Results: Respondents were 444 doctors and 237 nurses. They reported overcrowding, noise, lack of time and privacy as barriers to care. Most (93.3%) agreed/strongly agreed that the dying patient should be allocated private space in ED. 73.6% (451) felt unable to provide a desired level of care to advanced cancer patients in ED. Clinician attitudes were affected by staff type, experience, ED demographic and hospital type, but not education in palliative care. Conclusions: ED environments place pressure on clinicians delivering care to people with advanced cancer. Integrating palliative care services in ED and redesigning EDs to better match its multifaceted functions should be considered. © 2015, Weiland et al.; licensee Springer.","Cancer; Emergency medicine; End-of-life care; Palliative care; Survey","Bailey CJ, Murphy R, Porock D.

Case description: This report describes ALPPS in a 63-year-old male patient with rectal cancer and synchronous multiple liver metastases. The primary lesion was resected, followed by chemotherapy. We had planned to completely resect the metastases in both liver lobes, but CT volumetry revealed a very small FLR (364 ml, 29% of the total liver volume, 0.61% of total body weight). His indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes was 12.7%. Because of the risk of tumor progression in the interim, we performed ALPPS. During the first stage, the tumor in segment 3 was resected, the right lobe was mobilized, the liver was partitioned, and the right portal vein was ligated. The right hepatic artery, duct and vein were secured with vessel loops. CT on postoperative day 6 showed sufficient FLR increase (from 364 ml to 573 ml, or from 0.61% to 0.96% of total body weight) and ICGR15 improvement to 3.4%. The second stage of ALPPS was on postoperative day 7, completing resection of the metastases. The patient recovered well and was discharged 21 days after the second step. Discussion and evaluation: The ALPPS approach has many advantages, but it lacks evidence of long-term results. Considering the high mortality and morbidity rates of ALPPS, it is essential to evaluate its risks and benefits in individual patients and determine the strict criteria for this surgical method. Conclusions: ALPPS procedure rapidly increases FLR, permitting extended hepatectomy for patients with initially insufficient FLR. © 2015, Ome et al.; licensee Springer.","ALPPS; Associated liver partition and portal vein ligation; Colorectal cancer; Liver metastasis; Two-stage hepatectomy","Adam, R., Laurent, A., Azoulay, D., Castaing, D., Bismuth, H., Two-stage hepatectomy: a planned strategy to treat irresectable liver tumors (2000) Ann Surg, 232, pp. 777-785; Alvarez, F.A., Ardiles, V., Sanchez Claria, R., Pekolj, J., de Santibañes, E., Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS): tips and tricks (2013) J Gastrointest Surg, 17, pp. 814-821; Azoulay, D., Castaing, D., Smail, A., Adam, R., Cailliez, V., Laurent, A., Lemoine, A., Bismuth, H., Resection of nonresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer after percutaneous portal vein embolization (2000) Ann Surg, 231, pp. 480-486; Baumgart, J., Lang, S., Lang, H., A new method for induction of liver hypertrophy prior to right trisectionectomy: a report of three cases (2011) HPB (Oxford), 13, pp. 71-72. , abstract P0008L; de Santibañes, E., Clavien, P.A., Playing Play-Doh to prevent postoperative liver failure: the “ALPPS” approach (2012) Ann Surg, 255, pp. 415-417; de Santibañes, E., Alvarez, F.A., Ardiles, V., How to avoid postoperative liver failure: a novel method (2012) World J Surg, 36, pp. 125-128; Dokmak, S., Belghiti, J., Which limits to the “ALPPS” approach?

It displays a distinct clinical behavior. This study aims to assess the clinical, molecular and prognostic characteristics of TNBC patients. Patients/Methods: TNBC patients, referred to a tertiary medical center, 1/1/2000 – 31/12/2005, were included. Clinical, molecular and prognostic characteristics were retrospectively collected from patients’ records. Results: Overall, 122 consecutive TNBC patients were included with a median age of 54 years. Among the TNBC patients, 101 (82.8%) were Jews and 21 (17.2%) were Arabs. Family history for breast cancer was reported in 30 patients (24.6%). Genetic counseling was conducted in 30 patients (24.6%); 22/30 (73.3%) had BRCA1/2 mutations. Median tumor size was 2 cm and positive lymph nodes were detected in pathological examination in 40 patients (34%). At the time of data analysis, 21/118 patients (17.8%), who initially presented with early disease, had developed metastasis. Local recurrence was detected in four patients (3.4%). The overall survival (OS) was significantly longer for patients younger than 60 years compared to those ≥ 60 years, (Hazard ratio (HR) =2.1, p=0.046). Nulliparous patients had significantly higher OS than patients with a reproductive history of ≥ 4 children. (HR=0.31, p= 0.041). Mortality rate was higher for Arabs versus Jews but did not reach significance, (HR=1.33; P=0.64). Conclusions: TNBC represents an exclusive clinical behavior. Older age and parity were found to be poor prognostic factors. Further larger studies are needed to reaffirm our findings and explore the genetics among non-BRCA1/2 TNBC patients. © 2015, Asleh-Aburaya and Fried; licensee Springer.","BRCA mutation; Distant metastasis; Overall Survival; Triple Negative Breast Cancer","Amirikia, K.C., Mills, P., Bush, J., Newman, L.A., Higher population-based incidence rates of triple-negative breast cancer among young African-American women: implications for breast cancer screening recommendations (2011) Cancer, 117 (12), pp. 2747-2753; Atchley, D.P., Albarracin, C.T., Lopez, A., Valero, V., Amos, C.I., Gonzalez-Angulo, A.M., Hortobagyi, G.N., Arun, B.K., Clinical and pathologic characteristics of patients with BRCA-positive and BRCA-negative breast cancer (2008) J Clin Oncol, 26 (26), pp. 4282-4288; Badve, S., Dabbas, D.J., Schnitt, S.J., Baehner, F.L., Decker, T., Eusebi, V., Fox, S.B., Reis-Filho, J.S., Basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers: a critical review with an emphasis on the implications for pathologists and oncologists (2011) Mod Pathol, 24, pp. 157-167; Boyle, P., Triple-negative breast cancer: epidemiological considerations and recommendations (2012) Ann Oncol, 23, pp. 7-12; Carey, L., Winer, E., Viale, G., Cameron, D., Gianni, L., Triple-negative breast cancer: disease entity or title of convenience?

However, there are particular pancreatic tumors having various grades of malignancy such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. We examined whether the cut-off value of maximum standardized uptake value (SUV<inf>max</inf>) determined by pancreatic ductal cancers is also applicable for other pancreatic tumors. One hundred thirty six patients with pancreatic tumors underwent FDG-PET imaging. We first analyzed the cut-off value to differentiate pancreatic ductal cancers from mass-forming chronic pancreatitis. Secondly, we determined the cut-off value between malignant IPMN and benign IPMN. Thirdly, we computed a cut-off value between malignant pancreatic tumors and benign tumors irrespective of tumor type. The optimal cut-off value to differentiate ductal cancers from mass-forming chronic pancreatitis was 2.5. The optimal cut-off value for differentiating malignant IPMN from benign IPMN was also 2.5, similar to that of reported studies. In all types of pancreatic tumors, the cut-off value was also 2.5. The accuracy for detecting malignancy was 93.4% for all tumors. In the FDG-PET study for pancreatic tumors, an SUV<inf>max</inf> of 2.5 would be justified as a cut-off value to differentiate malignant lesions. © 2015, Yoshioka et al.; licensee Springer.","Cut-off; FDG-PET; IPMN; Non-ductal pancreatic cancer; SUV","Bares, R., Klever, P., Hauptmann, S., Hellwig, D., Fass, J., Cremerius, U., Schumpelick, V., Büll, U., F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET in vivo evaluation of pancreatic glucose metabolism for detection of pancreatic cancer (1994) Radiology, 192, pp. 79-86; Beiderwellen, K.J., Poeppel, T.D., Hartung-Knemeyer, V., Buchbender, C., Kuehl, H., Bockisch, A., Lauenstein, T.C., Simultaneous 65Ga-DOTATOC PET/MRI in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: initial results (2013) Invest Radiol, 48, pp. 273-279; Berberat, P., Freiss, H., Kashiwagi, M., Berger, H.G., Büchler, M.W., Diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer by positron emission tomography (1999) World J Surg, 23, pp. 882-887; Brom, M., Oyen, W.J.G., Joosten, L., Gotthardt, M., Boerman, O.C., 68Ga-labelled exendin-3, a new agent for the detection of insulinomas with PET (2010) Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging, 37, pp. 1345-1355; Delbeke, D., Oncological applications of FDG-PET imaging (1999) J Nucl Med, 40, pp. 1706-1715; Delbeke, D., Rose, D.M., Chapman, W.C., Pinson, C.W., Wright, J.K., Beauchamp, R.D., Shyr, Y., Leach, S.D., Optimal interpretation of FDG PET in the diagnosis, staging and management of pancreatic carcinoma (1999) J Nucl Med, 40, pp. 1784-1791; Delbeke, D., Coleman, R.E., Guiberteau, M.J., Brown, M.L., Royal, H.D., Siegel, B.A., Townsend, D.W., Holbrook, S., Procedure guideline for tumor imaging with 18F-FDG PET/CT 1.0 (2006) J Nucl Med, 47, pp. 885-895; Eriksson, O., Velikyan, I., Selvaraju, R.K., Kandeel, F., Johansson, L., Antoni, G., Eriksson, B., Korsgren, O., Detection of metastatic insulinoma by positron emission tomography with [(68)ga]exendin-4-a case report (2014) J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 99, pp. 1519-1524; Gabriel, M., Decristoforo, C., Kendler, D., Dobrozemsky, G., Heute, D., Uprimny, C., Kovacs, P., Virgolini, I.J., 68Ga-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotide PET in neuroendocrine tumors: comparison with somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and CT (2007) J Nucl Med, 48, pp. 508-518; Herrmann, K., Erkan, M., Dobritz, M., Schuster, T., Siveke, J.T., Beer, A.J., Wester, H.J., Buck, A.K., Comparison of 3′-deoxy-3′-[18F] fluorothymidine positron emission tomography (FLT PET) and FDG PET/CT for the detection and characterization of pancreatic tunours (2012) Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging, 39, pp. 846-851; Hong, H.S., Yun, M., Cho, A., Choi, J.Y., Kim, M.J., Kim, K.W., Choi, Y.J., Lee, J.D., The utility of F-18 FDG PET/CT in the evaluation of pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (2010) Clin Nucl Med, 35, pp. 776-779; Imdahl, A., Nitzsche, E., Krautmann, F., Högerle, S., Boos, S., Einert, A., Sontheimer, J., Farthmann, E.H., Evaluation of positron emission tomography with 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose for the differentiation of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer (1999) Br J Surg, 86, pp. 194-199; Inokuma, T., Tamaki, N., Torizuka, T., Fujita, T., Magata, Y., Yonekura, Y., Ohshio, G., Konishi, J., Value of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose and thallium-201 in the detection of pancreatic cancer (1995) J Nucl Med, 36, pp. 229-235; Ishizu, K., Sadato, N., Yonekura, Y., Nishizawa, S., Magata, Y., Tamaki, N., Tsuchida, T., Konishi, J., Enhanced detection of brain tumors by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET with glucose loading (1994) J Comput Assist Tomogr, 18, pp. 12-15; Jansson, T., Westlin, J.E., Ahlstrom, H., Lija, A., Langstrom, B., Bergh, J., Positron emission tomography studies in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer: A method for early therapy evaluation?

The pretreatment levels of these markers were evaluated through immunoassays carried out in 58 patients. The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method and differences between groups were compared by means of the Log-Rank test. Association of risk factors with survival was evaluated using the univariate and multivariate Cox modelling procedures. Higher CEA (>5 ng/mL) and sEGFR (>56.87 ng/mL) concentrations associated significantly with a higher overall survival. The pre-treatment sEGFR serum levels constituted an independent prognostic factor. The EGFR gene mutational status and the sEGFR level combination was the single to associate significantly with longer progression-free survival periods, in circumstances in which the EGFR gene was mutated and increased protein serum levels were detected. The overall survival as assessed through a Cox analysis revealed similar death hazards with respect to low sEGFR levels combined both with non-mutated EGFR genotypes and low CEA serum levels. Our results suggest that the pre-treatment CEA and sEGFR serum levels may provide a comparable source of information to that supplied by the EGFR gene mutational status with respect to the prognosis of erlotinib treated NSCLC patients. A combined sEGFR and CEA level appraisal could be of considerable value to select patients to undergo EGFR-TKI treatments. © 2015, Romero-Ventosa et al.; licensee Springer.","CEA; EGFR; Erlotinib; Non-small cell lung cancer; Prognosis; Survival prediction","Baselga, J., Why the epidermal growth factor receptor?

The introduction of intraperitoneal chemotherapy in 2006 had led to a 16 month improvement in the overall survival. However, catheter-related complication and the complexity of the procedure had deterred intraperitoneal route as the preferred route of treatment. Other alternative treatments had been developed by incorporating other FDA-approved agents or procedures such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), hyperthermic intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) and the administration of bevacizumab. Various clinical trials were conducted on these alternatives as both the first-line treatment and second- or third-line therapy for the recurrent disease. The outcome of these studies were summarized and discussed. A prospective improvement in the treatment of ovarian cancer could be done through the use of a drug delivery system. Selected promising recent developments in ovarian cancer drug delivery systems using different delivery vehicles, surface modifications, materials and drugs were also reviewed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, no clinical trials have compared the efficacy and toxicity of platinum combination and docetaxel as subsequent re-challenge chemotherapies after cancer recurrence following CRT. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of platinum combination chemotherapy versus docetaxel monotherapy in NSCLC patients previously treated with platinum-based CRT. From September 2002 to December 2009, at three participating institutions, 24 patients with locally advanced NSCLC, who had previously received platinum-based CRT, were treated with platinum combination re-challenge therapy, whereas 61 received docetaxel monotherapy. We reviewed their medical charts to evaluate patient characteristics and data regarding treatment response, survival, and toxicity. The response rates were 16.7% and 6.6% in the platinum combination chemotherapy and docetaxel monotherapy groups, respectively (p = 0.09), whereas disease control rates were 58.3% and 57.4%, respectively (p = 0.82). Progression-free survival was similar between the two groups (median, 4.2 vs. 2.3 months; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51–1.29; p = 0.38), as was overall survival (median, 16.5 vs. 13.0 months; HR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.47–1.41; p = 0.47). The incidence and severity of toxicity was also similar between the two groups. Hematological toxicity, particularly leukopenia and neutropenia, was more frequent in the docetaxel group. Our results indicated that platinum combination re-challenge was equivalent to docetaxel for relapsed patients previously treated with platinum-based CRT. © 2015, Imai et al.; licensee Springer.","Chemoradiotherapy; Docetaxel; Non-small cell lung cancer; Platinum combination; Recurrence; Second-line chemotherapy","Ardizzoni, A., Tiseo, M., Boni, L., Vincent, A.D., Passalacqua, R., Buti, S., Amoroso, D., Smit, E.F., Pemetrexed versus pemetrexed and carboplatin as second-line chemotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: results of the GOIRC 02-2006 randomized phase II study and pooled analysis with the NVALT7 trial (2012) J Clin Oncol, 30 (36), pp. 4501-4507; Auperin, A., Le Pechoux, C., Rolland, E., Curran, W.J., Furuse, K., Fournel, P., Belderbos, J., Pignon, J.P., Meta-analysis of concomitant versus sequential radiochemotherapy in locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (2010) J Clin Oncol, 28 (13), pp. 2181-2190; Auperin, A., Le Pechoux, C., Pignon, J.P., Koning, C., Jeremic, B., Clamon, G., Einhorn, L., Arriagada, R., Concomitant radio-chemotherapy based on platin compounds in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): a meta-analysis of individual data from 1764 patients (2006) Ann Oncol, 17 (3), pp. 473-483; Azzoli, C.G., Temin, S., Aliff, T., Baker, S., Jr., Brahmer, J., Johnson, D.H., Laskin, J.L., Giaccone, G., 2011 Focused Update of 2009 American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline Update on Chemotherapy for Stage IV Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (2011) J Clin Oncol, 29 (28), pp. 3825-3831; Cosaert, J., Quoix, E., Platinum drugs in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (2002) Br J Cancer, 87 (8), pp. 825-833; D'Addario, G., Pintilie, M., Leighl, N.B., Feld, R., Cerny, T., Shepherd, F.A., Platinum-based versus non-platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis of the published literature (2005) J Clin Oncol, 23 (13), pp. 2926-2936; Ebi, N., Kubota, K., Nishiwaki, Y., Hojo, F., Matsumoto, T., Kakinuma, R., Ohmatsu, H., Kodama, T., Second-line chemotherapy for relapsed small cell lung cancer (1997) Jpn J Clin Oncol, 27 (3), pp. 166-169; Fossella, F.V., DeVore, R., Kerr, R.N., Crawford, J., Natale, R.R., Dunphy, F., Kalman, L., Hammershaimb, L., Randomized phase III trial of docetaxel versus vinorelbine or ifosfamide in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens.

To provide a comprehensive basis for nevertheless observed slight differences in tracer biodistribution and dosimetry, the characteristics of [68Ga]HA-DOTATATE were investigated in a detailed preclinical study. Methods: Affinities of natGa-HA-DOTATATE and natGa-DOTATATE to sst<inf>1–5</inf> were determined using membrane preparations and [125I]SST-28 as radioligand. Internalization into AR42J cells was studied in dual-tracer studies with [125I]TOC as internal reference. Biodistribution was investigated using AR42J tumor-bearing CD1 mice, and specificity of tracer uptake was confirmed in competition studies by coinjection of 0.8 mg TOC/kg. Results: Sst<inf>2</inf> affinities (IC<inf>50</inf>) of [natGa]HA-DOTATATE (1.4 ± 0.8 nM, logP: −3.16) and [natGa]DOTATATE (1.2 ± 0.6 nM, logP: −3.69) were nearly identical. Both compounds displayed IC<inf>50</inf> > 1 μM for sst<inf>1,3,4</inf>, while sst<inf>5</inf> affinity was markedly increased for natGa-HA-DOTATATE (102 ± 65 nM vs >1 μM for natGa-DOTATATE). [natLu]HA-DOTATATE and [natLu]DOTATATE showed slightly lower, identical sst<inf>2</inf> affinities (2.0 ± 1.6 and 2.0 ± 0.8 nM, respectively) and sst<inf>3</inf> affinities of 93 ± 1 and 162 ± 16 nM. Internalization of [68Ga]HA-DOTATATE was tenfold higher than that of [125I]TOC but only sixfold higher for [68Ga]DOTATATE and [177Lu]HA-DOTATATE. While [68Ga]HA-DOTATATE and [68Ga]DOTATATE had shown similar target- and non-target uptake in patients, biodistribution studies in mice at 1 h post injection (n = 5) revealed slightly increased non-specific uptake of [68Ga]HA-DOTATATE in the blood, liver, and intestines (0.7 ± 0.3, 1.0 ± 0.2, and 4.0 ± 0.7 %iD/g vs 0.3 ± 0.1, 0.5 ± 0.1, and 2.7 ± 0.8 %iD/g for [68Ga]DOTATATE). However, sst-mediated accumulation of [68Ga]HA-DOTATATE in the pancreas, adrenals, and tumor was significantly enhanced (36.6 ± 4.3, 10.8 ± 3.2, and 33.6 ± 10.9 %iD/g vs 26.1 ± 5.0, 5.1 ± 1.4, and 24.1 ± 4.9 %iD/g, respectively). Consequently, tumor/background ratios for [68Ga]HA-DOTATATE in the AR42J model are comparable or slightly increased compared to [68Ga]DOTATATE. Conclusions: The present preclinical data fully confirm the general biodistribution pattern and excellent in vivo sst-targeting characteristics previously observed for [68Ga]HA-DOTATATE in patients. The effect of slightly enhanced lipophilicity on background accumulation and normal organ dose is compensated by the high uptake of [68Ga]HA-DOTATATE in tumor.

Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), however, its positive effects are diminished under hypoxia. We wanted to determine if co-treatment with cisplatin and histone deacetalyse (HDAC) inhibitor panobinostat can reduce hypoxia-induced cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells, and to elucidate mechanism involved. Methods: Expression status of different HDACS was determined in two cell lines and in tumor tissue from 20 patients. Cells were treated with cisplatin, panobinostat, or with combination of both under normoxic and hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. Cell cycle, viability, acetylation of histones, and activation of apoptosis were determined. HIF-1α stability and its interaction with HDAC4 were analyzed. Results: Most class I and II HDACs were expressed in NSCLC cells and tumor samples. Co-treatment of tumor cells with cisplatin and panobinostat decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis more efficiently than in primary, non-malignant bronchial epithelial cells. Co-treatment induced apoptosis by causing chromatin fragmentation, activation of caspases-3 and 7 and PARP cleavage. Toxic effects were more pronounced under hypoxic conditions. Co-treatment resulted in destabilization and degradation of HIF-1α and HDAC4, a protein responsible for acetylation and de/stabilization of HIF-1α. Direct interaction between HDAC4 and HIF-1α proteins in H23 cells was detected. Conclusions: Here we show that hypoxia-induced cisplatin resistance can be overcome by combining cisplatin with panobinostat, a potent HDAC inhibitor. These findings may contribute to the development of a new therapeutic strategy for NSCLC. © 2015 Fischer et al.","Apoptosis; Cisplatin; HIF-1α; Non-small cell lung cancer; Panobinostat","Jemal, A., Bray, F., Center, M.M., Ferlay, J., Ward, E., Forman, D., Global cancer statistics (2011) CA Cancer J Clin, 61, pp. 69-90;

Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to linifanib 17.5 mg once daily or sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. Patients were stratified by region (Outside Asia, Japan, and rest of Asia), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score (ECOG PS; 0 or 1), vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread (yes or no), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (yes or no). The primary end point of the study was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were time to progression (TTP) and objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1. Results We randomly assigned 1,035 patients (median age, 60 years; Asian, 66.6%; ECOG PS 0, 65.2%; HBV, 49.1%; vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread, 70.1%). Median OS was 9.1 months on the linifanib arm (95% CI, 8.1 to 10.2) and 9.8 months on the sorafenib arm (95% CI, 8.3 to 11.0; hazard ratio [HR], 1.046; 95% CI, 0.896 to 1.221). For prespecified stratification subgroups, OS HRs ranged from 0.793 to 1.119 and the 95% CI contained 1.0. Median TTP was 5.4 months on the linifanib arm (95% CI, 4.2 to 5.6) and 4.0 months on the sorafenib arm (95% CI, 2.8 to 4.2; HR, 0.759; 95% CI, 0.643 to 0.895; P = .001). Best response rate was 13.0% on the linifanib arm versus 6.9% on the sorafenib arm. Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs); serious AEs; and AEs leading to discontinuation, dose interruption, and reduction were more frequent with linifanib (all P <.001). Conclusion Linifanib and sorafenib had similar OS in advanced HCC. Predefined superiority and noninferiority OS boundaries were not met for linifanib and the study failed to meet the primary end point. TTP and ORR favored linifanib; safety results favored sorafenib.

Our objective was to determine use of tumor marker tests such as carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 15-3/CA 27.29 and associated Medicare costs in early-stage breast cancer survivors. Methods By using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare records for patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer between 2001 and 2007, tumor marker usage within 2 years after diagnosis was identified by billing codes. Logistic regression models were used to identify clinical and demographic factors associated with use of tumor markers. To determine impact on costs of care, we used multivariable regression, controlling for other factors known to influence total medical costs. Results We identified 39,650 eligible patients. Of these, 16,653 (42%) received at least one tumor marker assessment, averaging 5.7 tests over 2 years, with rates of use per person increasing over time. Factors significantly associated with use included age at diagnosis, diagnosis year, stage at diagnosis, race/ethnicity, geographic region, and urban/rural status. Rates of advanced imaging, but not biopsies, were significantly higher in the assessment group. Medical costs for patients who received at least one test were approximately 29% greater than costs for those who did not, adjusting for other factors. Conclusion Breast cancer tumor markers are frequently used among women with early-stage disease and are associated with an increase in both diagnostic procedures and total cost of care. A better understanding of factors driving the use of and the potential benefits and harms of surveillancebased tumor marker testing is needed.

Methods We analyzed the associations between prediagnosis (n = 3,797) and postdiagnosis (n = 1,759) leisure time physical activity (LTPA) and TV watching and overall and disease-specific mortality among patients with CRC. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs, adjusting for known mortality risk factors. Results Comparing survivors of CRC reporting more than 7 hours per week (h/wk) of prediagnosis LTPA with those reporting no LTPA, we found a 20% lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.95; P for trend =.021). Postdiagnosis LTPA of > 7 h/wk, compared with none, was associated with a 31% lower all-cause mortality risk (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.98; P for trend =.006), independent of prediagnosis activity. Compared with 0 to 2 TV hours per day (h/d) before diagnosis, those reporting > 5 h/d of TV before diagnosis had a 22% increased all-cause mortality risk (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.41; P trend = .002), and more postdiagnosis TV watching was associated with a nonsignificant 25% increase in all-cause mortality risk (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.67; P for trend = .126). Conclusion LTPA was inversely associated with all-cause mortality, whereas more TV watching was associated with increased mortality risk. For both LTPA and TV watching, postdiagnosis measures independently explained the association with mortality. Clinicians should promote both minimizing TV time and increasing physical activity for longevity among survivors of CRC, regardless of previous behaviors.

Precise estimates of the risk, presentation, and outcomes of cancer in patients with AT need to be addressed in large series. Patients and Methods In this large retrospective cohort, 69 patients with cancers (24.5%) were identified among 279 patients with AT. Centralized review was performed on 60% of the lymphomas. Incidence rates were compared with the French population, and risk factors were analyzed. Results Eight patients developed acute leukemias (including four T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias), 12 developed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 38 developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), three developed T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), and eight developed carcinoma at a median age of 8.3, 10.6, 9.7, 24.2, and 31.4 years, respectively (P < .001). The majority of NHLs were aggressive B-cell NHL. Epstein-Barr virus was associated with all of the HLs and 50% of the NHLs. Overall survival was shorter in patients with AT who developed cancer compared with those who did not develop cancer (15 v 24 years, respectively; P < .001). Survival was improved in patients who achieved a major response to treatment (3.46 v 0.87 years for major v minor responses, respectively; P = .011). Immunodeficiency was associated with increased risk of cancer. ATM mutation type was associated with a difference in survival in the entire cohort but not with cancer incidence or cancer survival. Conclusion B-cell NHL, HL, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia occur at a high rate and earlier age than carcinomas in AT. T-PLLs are rarer than initially reported. Prognosis is poor, but patients may benefit from treatment with an improved survival. © 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,"Louis-Bar, D., Sur un syndrome progressif comprenant des télangiectasies capillaires cutanées et conjonctivales symétriques, à disposition naevoïde et des troubles cérébelleux (1941) Confin Neurol, 4, pp. 32-42;

Patients and Methods Data from seven GCT trials conducted by the Children's Oncology Group (United States) or the Children's Cancer and Leukemia Group (United Kingdom) between 1985 and 2009 were merged to create a data set of patients with stage II to IV disease treated with platinum-based therapy. A parametric cure model was used to evaluate the prognostic importance of age, tumor site, stage, histology, tumor markers, and treatment regimen and estimate the percentage of patients who achieved long-term disease-free (LTDF) survival in each subgroup of the final model. Validation of the model was conducted using the bootstrap method. Results In multivariable analysis of 519 patients with GCTs, stage IV disease (P = .001), age ≥ 11 years (P < .001), and tumor site (P > .001) were significant predictors of worse LTDF survival. Elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥10,000 ng/mL was associated with worse outcome, whereas pure yolk sac tumor (YST) was associated with better outcome, although neither met criteria for statistical significance. The analysis identified a group of patients age > 11 years with either stage III to IV extragonadal tumors or stage IV ovarian tumors with predicted LTDF survival < 70%. A bootstrap procedure showed retention of age, tumor site, and stage in > 94%, AFP in 12%, and YST in 27% of the replications. Conclusion Clinical trial data from two large national pediatric clinical trial organizations have produced a new evidence-based risk stratification of malignant pediatric GCTs that identifies a poor-risk group warranting intensified therapy.

Although cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the treatment of choice in the general population, the use of CBT-I in patients with cancer is complicated, because it can result in transient but substantial increases in daytime sleepiness. In this study, we evaluated whether CBT-I, in combination with the wakefulness-promoting agent armodafinil (A), results in better insomnia treatment outcomes in cancer survivors than CBT-I alone. Patients and Methods We report on a randomized trial of 96 cancer survivors (mean age, 56 years; female, 87.5%; breast cancer, 68%). The primary analyses examined whether one of the 7-week intervention conditions (ie, CBT-I, A, or both), when compared with a placebo capsule (P) group, produced significantly greater clinical gains. Insomnia was assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index and sleep quality by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory. All patients received sleep hygiene instructions. Results Analyses controlling for baseline differences showed that both the CBT-I plus A (P = .001) and CBT-I plus P (P= .010) groups had significantly greater reductions in insomnia severity postintervention than the P group, with effect sizes of 1.31 and 1.02, respectively. Similar improvements were seen for sleep quality. Gains on both measures persisted 3 months later. CBT-I plus A was not significantly different from CBT-I plus P (P =.421), and A alone was not significantly different from P alone (P =.584). Conclusion CBT-I results in significant and durable improvements in insomnia and sleep quality. A did not significantly improve the efficacy of CBT-I or independently affect insomnia or sleep quality.

Exploratory analyses of studies that used COX-2 inhibitors have demonstrated potentially superior outcome in patients in whom the urinary metabolite of PGE2 (PGE-M) is suppressed. We hypothesized that patients with disease defined by PGE-M suppression would benefit from the addition of apricoxib to second-line docetaxel or pemetrexed. Patients and Methods Patients with NSCLC who had disease progression after one line of platinum-based therapy, performance status of 0 to 2, and normal organ function were potentially eligible. Only patients with a 50% decrease in urinary PGE-M after 5 days of treatment with apricoxib could enroll. Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 or pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 once every 21 days per the investigator was administered with apricoxib or placebo 400 mg once per day. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Exploratory analysis was performed regarding baseline urinary PGE-M and outcomes. Results In all, 101 patients completed screening, and 72 of the 80 who demonstrated 50% suppression were randomly assigned to apricoxib or placebo. Toxicity was similar between the arms. No improvement in PFS was seen with apricoxib versus placebo. The median PFS for the control arm was 97 days (95% CI, 52 to 193 days) versus 85 days (95% CI, 67 to 142 days) for the experimental arm (P =.91).

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has a policy and set of procedures for endorsing clinical practice guidelines that have been developed by other professional organizations. Methods The Familial Risk-Colorectal Cancer: European Society for Medical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline published in 2013 on behalf of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Guidelines Working Group in Annals of Oncology was reviewed for developmental rigor by methodologists, with content and recommendations reviewed by an ASCO endorsement panel. Results The ASCO endorsement panel determined that the recommendations of the ESMO guidelines are clear, thorough, and based on the most relevant scientific evidence. The ASCO panel endorsed the ESMO guidelines and added a few qualifying statements. Recommendations Approximately 5% to 6% of patient cases of CRC are associated with germline mutations that confer an inherited predisposition for cancer. The possibility of a hereditary cancer syndrome should be assessed for every patient at the time of CRC diagnosis. A diagnosis of Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, or another genetic syndrome can influence clinical management for patients with CRC and their family members. Screening for hereditary cancer syndromes in patients with CRC should include review of personal and family histories and testing of tumors for DNA mismatch repair deficiency and/or microsatellite instability. Formal genetic evaluation is recommended for individuals who meet defined criteria.

Ramucirumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 antibody that binds vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and blocks ligand-stimulated activation. The ROSE/TRIO-012 trial evaluated ramucirumab with docetaxel in unresectable, locally recurrent, or metastatic breast cancer. Patients and Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multinational phase III trial, 1,144 patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -negative breast cancer who had not received cytotoxic chemotherapy in the advanced setting were randomly assigned at a two-to-one ratio to receive docetaxel 75 mg/m2 plus ramucirumab 10 mg/kg or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 plus placebo once every 3 weeks. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other withdrawal criteria. Patients were stratified by previous taxane therapy, visceral metastasis, hormone receptor status, and geographic region. An independent data monitoring committee oversaw the trial. The primary end point was investigator-assessed PFS. Results: Median PFS in patients treated with ramucirumab plus docetaxel was 9.5 months, compared with 8.2 months in patients who received placebo plus docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; P = .077). Median overall survival was 27.3 months in patients who received ramucirumab plus docetaxel, compared with 27.2 months in patients who received placebo plus docetaxel (HR, 1.01; P = .915). Toxicities seen at significantly higher rates in patients receiving ramucirumab included fatigue, hypertension, febrile neutropenia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, and stomatitis. Conclusion: Addition of ramucirumab to docetaxel in HER2-negative advanced breast cancer did not meaningfully improve important clinical outcomes. © 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,"Jitawatanarat, P., Wee, W., Update on antiangiogenic therapy in colorectal cancer: Aflibercept and regorafenib (2013) J Gastrointest Oncol, 4, pp. 231-238;

We evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of S-1 in a recurrent colon cancer patient with CML treated with dasatinib. Patient: A 70-year-old man had undergone surgery three times for sigmoid colon cancer and recurrence. Systemic chemotherapy with S-1 plus oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab as a clinical trial had already been administered because of metastatic colon cancer. The patient's medical history was CML, and he had been receiving dasatinib treatment (100 mg once daily). Based on the diagnosis of unresectable and multiple metastases, S-1 monotherapy was started. S-1 (120 mg/day) was taken for 28 consecutive days, followed by a 14-day rest. Blood samples were obtained before and after the first administration of S-1. The plasma pharmacokinetics of S-1 were comparable to a pharmacokinetics study of S-1. Results: The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-8) of tegafur (FT), 5-chloro-2, 4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP), oxonate (Oxo), and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was 4,309.2, 716.3, 86.8, and 492.75 ng h/mL, respectively, after S-1 administration. The pharmacokinetics of FT, CDHP, Oxo, and 5-FU after treatment with S-1 were not significantly different from a phase I pharmacokinetics study of S-1. During treatment with S-1 and dasatinib, CML relapse and serious myelosuppression were not observed. Conclusions: Our report suggests that S-1 is an important treatment option for recurrent colorectal cancer in patients with CML treated with dasatinib. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Chronic myeloid leukemia; Dasatinib; Pharmacokinetics; Recurrent colon cancer; S-1","Jemal, A., Siegel, R., Xu, J., Cancer statistics (2010) CA Cancer J Clin, 60, pp. 277-300. , 20610543 10.3322/caac.20073; Edwards, B.K., Ward, E., Kohler, B.A., Report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2006, featuring colorectal cancer trends and impact of interventions (risk factors, screening, and treatment) to reduce future rates (2010) Cancer, 116, pp. 544-573. , 3619726 19998273 10.1002/cncr.24760; Goldberg, R.M., Sargent, D.J., Morton, R.F., A randomized controlled trial of fl uorouracil plus leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin combinations in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer (2004) J Clin Oncol, 22, pp. 23-30. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2cXpsVKitbY%3D 14665611; Tournigand, C., Andre, T., Achille, E., FOLFIRI followed by FOLFOX6 or the reverse sequence in advanced colorectal cancer: A randomized GERCOR study (2004) J Clin Oncol, 22, pp. 229-237. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2cXpsVKit7w%3D 14657227; Shirasaka, T., Development history and concept of an oral anticancer agent S-1 (TS-1): Its clinical usefulness and future vistas (2009) Jpn J Clin Oncol, 39, pp. 2-15. , 2639406 19052037 10.1093/jjco/hyn127; Muro, K., Boku, N., Shimada, Y., Irinotecan plus S-1 (IRIS) versus fluorouracil and folinic acid plus irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as second-line chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer: A randomised phase 2/3 non-inferiority study (FIRIS study) (2010) Lancet Oncol, 11, pp. 853-860. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3cXhtFWqsrzM 20708966; Yamada, Y., Takahari, D., Matsumoto, H., Leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab versus S-1 and oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (SOFT): An open-label, non-inferiority, randomised phase 3 trial (2013) Lancet Oncol, 14, pp. 1278-1286. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXhslGlsrjJ 24225157; Yamada, Y., Tahara, M., Miya, T., Phase I/II study of oxaliplatin with oral S-1 as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (2008) Br J Cancer, 98, pp. 1034-1038. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXjtlGkur4%3D 2275487 18319719; Schmoll, H.J., Van Cutsem, E., Stein, A., ESMO Consensus guidelines for management of patients with colon and rectal cancer.

Until recently, almost all the work done to study this limitation has been restricted to tumour cells. Here we identify a novel molecular mechanism by which endothelial cells regulate chemosensitivity. We establish that specific targeting of focal adhesion kinase (FAK; also known as PTK2) in endothelial cells is sufficient to induce tumour-cell sensitization to DNA-damaging therapies and thus inhibit tumour growth in mice. The clinical relevance of this work is supported by our observations that low blood vessel FAK expression is associated with complete remission in human lymphoma. Our study shows that deletion of FAK in endothelial cells has no apparent effect on blood vessel function per se, but induces increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation within perivascular tumour-cell compartments of doxorubicin- and radiotherapy-treated mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that endothelial-cell FAK is required for DNA-damage-induced NF-κB activation in vivo and in vitro, and the production of cytokines from endothelial cells. Moreover, loss of endothelial-cell FAK reduces DNA-damage-induced cytokine production, thus enhancing chemosensitization of tumour cells to DNA-damaging therapies in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our data identify endothelial-cell FAK as a regulator of tumour chemosensitivity. Furthermore, we anticipate that this proof-of-principle data will be a starting point for the development of new possible strategies to regulate chemosensitization by targeting endothelial-cell FAK specifically. ©2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The phenolic composition of the PWGPE was determined by rapid resolution liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (RRLC/MS). The PWGPE had 92.6, 43.3 and 6.01 mg/g of flavanols, flavonols and phenolic acids, respectively and, along with pure catechin, epicatechin, quercetin and gallic acid, they were all found capable of inhibiting cellular proliferation. PWGPE (100 μg/ml) inhibited the proliferation of cells by 52.1% at 48 h, whilst catechin, epicatechin, quercetin and gallic acid (60 μg/ml) inhibited growth by 65.2%, 62.2%, 81.0% and 71.0%, respectively, at 72 h.

Although selective inhibitors of mutant IDH1 and IDH2 have been identified and are currently under investigation as potential cancer therapeutics, the mechanistic basis for their selectivity is not yet well understood. A high throughput screen for selective inhibitors of IDH1 bearing the oncogenic mutation R132H identified compound 1, a bis-imidazole phenol that inhibits D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid production in cells. We investigated the mode of inhibition of compound 1 and a previously published IDH1 mutant inhibitor with a different chemical scaffold. Steady-state kinetics and biophysical studies show that both of these compounds selectively inhibit mutant IDH1 by binding to an allosteric site and that inhibition is competitive with respect to Mg2+. A crystal structure of compound 1 complexed with R132H IDH1 indicates that the inhibitor binds at the dimer interface and makes direct contact with a residue involved in binding of the catalytically essential divalent cation. These results show that targeting a divalent cation binding residue can enable selective inhibition of mutant IDH1 and suggest that differences in magnesium binding between wild-type and mutant enzymes may contribute to the inhibitors' selectivity for the mutant enzyme. © 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Tennant, D.A., Durán, R.V., Gottlieb, E., Targeting metabolic transformation for cancer therapy (2010) Nat.

In this work, we report the development of a novel polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane filter-based microdevice for rapid and highly efficient isolation of CTCs from peripheral blood. A precise and highly porous PDMS microfilter was fabricated and integrated into the microfiltration chip by combining a sacrificial transferring film with a sandwich molding method. We achieved >90% recovery when isolating lung cancer cells from spiked blood samples, with a relatively high processing throughput of 10. mL/h. In contrast to existing CTC filtration systems, which rely on low-porosity track-etch filters or expensive lithography-based filters, our microfiltration chip does not require complex e-beam lithography or the reactive ion etching process, therefore it offers a low-cost alternative tool for highly efficient CTC enrichment and in situ analysis. Thus, this new microdevice has the potential for use in routine monitoring of cancer development and cancer therapy in a clinical setting. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Circulating tumor cells; Microfluidic chip; PDMS-based filter; Sacrificial film","Autebert, J., Coudert, B., Bidard, F.C., (2012) Methods, 57 (3), pp. 297-307; Budd, G.T., Cristofanilli, M., Ellis, M.J., (2006) Clin.

Interdigitated transducers (IDTs) fabricated on LiNbO<inf>3</inf> substrate achieve a high quality factor (Q) of over 4000 at a frequency of 6.4GHz (third-order harmonic mode) using an optimized design and process. The biosensor shows excellent linear responses to target DNA in the range from 1μg/ml to 1ng/ml with a high sensitivity of 6.7×10-16g/cm2/Hz, hence the difference of a single hybridized DNA base can also be distinguished. With such a high mass resolution, the biosensor is capable of quantitative detection of living cancer cells. The frequency responses of single mouse mammary adenocarcinoma (EMT6) cell and mouse fibroblast (3T3) cell are studied. The interferences in the experiments show insignificant influence on the frequency shift, which verifies the high selectivity of the biosensor. The biosensor is also able to repeat the sensing ability after rough cleaning, therefore cost reduction is achieved from the recycling process in practical applications. The detection limit is defined from the noise analysis of the device, atomic resolution is realized according to the calculation, thereby initiating a potential tool for high-precision medical diagnoses and phenomena observation at the atomic-level. © 2015.","Atomic resolution; Cancer cell; DNA; High frequency; Label free; SAW biosensor","Aebersold, R., (2003) Nature, 422 (6928), pp. 198-207; Alivisatos, P., (2004) Nat.

The development of a point-of-care (POC) test for the disease-associated miRNAs would be especially beneficial, since miRNAs are unexpectedly well preserved in various human specimens, including urine. Here, we present the Mach-Zehnder interferometer-miRNA detection system capable of detecting multiple miRNAs in clinical urine samples rapidly and simultaneously in a label-free and real-time manner. Through measurement of the light phase change, the MZI sensor provides an optical platform for fast profiling of small molecules with improved accuracy. We demonstrate that this system could specifically detect target miRNAs (miR-21, and let-7a), and even identify the single nucleotide polymorphism of the let-7 family of miRNAs from synthetic and cell line samples. The clinical applicability of this system is confirmed by simultaneously detecting two types of miRNAs in urine samples of bladder cancer patients in a single reaction, with a detection time of 15. min.

Therefore, highly sensitive detection of lung cancer specific microRNAs provides an attractive approach in lung cancer early diagnostics. Herein, we designed 3D DNA origami structure that enables electrochemical detection of lung cancer related microRNAs. The 3D DNA origami structure is constituted of a ferrocene-tagged DNA of stem-loop structure combined with a thiolated tetrahedron DNA nanostructure at the bottom. The top portion hybridized with the lung cancer correlated microRNA, while the bottom portion was self-assembled on gold disk electrode surface, which was modified with gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and blocked with mercaptoethanol (MCH). The preparation process and the performance of the proposed electrochemical genosensor were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Under the optimal conditions, the developed genosensor had a detection limit of 10. pM and a good linearity with microRNA concentration ranging from 100. pM to 1. μM, which showed a great potential in highly sensitive clinical cancer diagnosis application. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer diagnostic; DNA origami; Electrochemical genosensor; MicroRNA","Baaklini, W.A., Reinoso, M.A., Gorin, A.B., Sharafkanch, A., Manian, P., Diagnostic yield of fiberoptic bronchoscopy in evaluating solitary pulmonary nodules (2000) Chest, 117 (4), pp. 1049-1054; Bakker, E., Qin, Y., Electrochemical sensors (2006) Anal.

Sensory interfaces were prepared through the modification of a glassy carbon electrode with highly cross-linked polyethylene glycol (PEG) film containing amine groups, followed by the self-assembly of gold nanoparticles and the immobilization of BRCA1 complementary single-strand 19-mer oligonucleotides. In the presence of a specific BRCA1 sequence capture and hybridization results in interfacial change sensitively monitored using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The combined utilization of a PEG polymer film and gold nanoparticle mixed interface enables very high levels of sensitivity and a highly effective assaying in patient samples. Assay linear range was from 50.0. fM to 1.0. nM, with a limit of detection of 1.72. fM. Furthermore, this label-free DNA sensor has been used for assaying BRCA1 in serum samples, showing its feasible potential for diagnostic applications in clinical analysis of breast cancer gene BRCA1.

In this study, we report label-free in situ monitoring and control of intracellular anti-cancer drug delivery process using biohybrid nanoparticles based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for the first time. Each biohybrid nanoparticle consisted of gold nanoparticle, cell-penetrating peptide (Tat peptide), and cancer-targeting antibody to increase the efficacy of the anti-cancer drug delivery with specific targeting and increased uptake rate. The doxorubicin (Dox)-loaded biohybrid nanoparticles were showed specific SERS spectra of Dox, specifically immobilized on the target cell membrane and quickly penetrated into the cells when treated on the mixed cell culture condition. The intracellular release of Dox from the biohybrid nanoparticle was continuously monitored with time-dependent change of intracellular SERS signals of Dox. The releasing rate of Dox was successfully controlled with the addition of glutathione on the cells. The anti-cancer effect of intracellular released Dox was confirmed with cell viability assay. With the proposed monitoring system, specific cancer cell targeting and improved uptake of the anti-cancer drug were detected and time-dependent intracellular release of the anti-cancer drug was monitored successfully. The proposed novel in situ monitoring system can be used as a spectroscopic analysis tool for label-free monitoring of the time-dependent release of various kinds of anti-cancer drugs inside cells. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cell-penetrating peptide; In situ monitoring; Intracellular release; Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy","An, J.H., (2014) Biosens.

For this purpose, the chemical conjugation of DOX·HCl onto thiolated hyaluronic acid (HA) was carried out by an acid liable hydrazone linkage and verified by 1H NMR analyses. When exposed to the air, such a polysaccharide conjugate showed unique self-gelation ability in aqueous solution. The gelation time and extent depended mainly on the content of thiol groups on thiolated HA. The resultant hydrogel exhibited a dominant elastic response and a thixotropic property. In particular, it could release sustainably conjugated DOX·HCl in dual pH- and reduction-responsive modes. The cumulative drug release was found to be significantly accelerated under the conditions mimicking the intracellular environments of cancer cells. The in vitro cytotoxicity assays for the human nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE2 cells treated with various release media confirmed the effectiveness of this conjugate hydrogel for cancer cell inhibition. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Dual aptamer system enables a broad diagnosis for breast cancer in comparison with the single aptamer system. The dye-doped silica nanoparticles offer great stability with respect to photobleaching and enable the accurate quantification of breast cancer cells. The morphological and spectroscopic characteristics of the designed Dual-SiNPs were demonstrated via diverse methods such as DLS, zeta potential measurements, UV-vis spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Negatively charged Dual-SiNPs with a homogeneous size distribution showed robust and strong fluorescence. In addition, Dual-SiNPs did not affect cell viability, implying that this probe might be readily available for use in an in vivo system. Through ratio optimization of the MUC1 and HER2 aptamers, the binding capacities of the Dual-SiNPs to both cell lines were maximized. Based on Dual-SiNPs, a highly sensitive quantification of breast cancer cells was performed, resulting in a detection limit of 1. cell/100. μL, which is significantly lower compared with those reported in other studies. Moreover, the developed detection platform displayed high selectivity for only the MUC1(+) and HER2(+) cell lines. It is expected that this valuable diagnostic probe will be a noteworthy platform for the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aptamer; Biosensor; Breast cancer; Dye-doped particle; Fluorescence; Silica nanoparticle","Alama, A., Truini, A., Coco, S., Genova, C., Grossi, F., (2014) Drug Discov.

The self-assembly formation of the DNA tweezers and the regulation of the tweezers upon alternative addition of the fuel miR-141 and the anti-fuel strands are characterized by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The addition of miR-141 to the DNA tweezers turns ""off"" the tweezers, while subsequent introduction of the anti-fuel strands switches the tweezers back to the ""on"" state, which verifies the regulatory ability of the tweezers. The miR-141-regulated DNA tweezers are concentration dependent and can be employed for sensitive detection of miR-141 down to 0.6. pM. The DNA tweezers also show high selectivity toward the fuel strand and can be used to monitor miR-141 expression in cancer cells, which provides new opportunities for the application of the dynamic DNA devices in clinical diagnostics. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cell; DNA tweezer; Fluorescence; Human prostate cancer; MicroRNA-141","Ackermann, D., Famulok, M., (2013) Nucleic Acids Res., 41, pp. 4729-4739; Bath, J., Turberfield, A.J., (2007) Nat.

Osteopontin (OPN), a protein present in several body fluids, has been suggested as a potential biomarker since its overexpression seems to be associated with breast cancer progression and metastasis. In this work, a simple and label-free voltammetric aptasensor for the detection of OPN, using an RNA aptamer previously reported to have affinity for human OPN as the molecular recognition element, and the ferro/ferricyanide solution as a redox probe, was developed. The RNA aptamer was synthetized and immobilized in a working microelectrode gold surface (diameter of 0.8. mm) of a screen-printed strip with a silver pseudo-reference electrode and a gold counter electrode. The electrochemical behavior of the electrode surface after each preparation step of the aptasensor was studied using cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry. The resulting voltammetric aptasensor was used to detect OPN in standard solutions. Cyclic voltammetry results showed that the aptasensor has reasonable detection and quantification limits (3.7±0.6. nM and 11±2. nM, respectively). Indeed, the detection limit falls within the osteopontin levels reported in the literature for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Moreover, the aptasensor is able to selectively detect the target protein in the presence of other interfering proteins, except for thrombin. Considering the overall results, a possible application of the aptasensor for cancer prognosis may be foreseen in a near future. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Osteopontin; Protein biomarker; RNA aptamer; Voltammetric aptasensor","Ahmed, M., Kundu, G.C., (2010) Mol.

To address this gap, we analyzed data from a Canadian population-based case-control study conducted in 1994-1997. Cases were 1064 adults with incident leukemia and controls were 5039 healthy adults. We used data from satellites and fixed-site monitoring stations to estimate residential concentrations of NO<inf>2</inf> and fine particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) for the period prior to diagnosis, starting in 1975 and ending in 1994. We modeled the average annual exposure of each subject. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using logistic regression, adjusted for age, gender, province, smoking, education, body mass index, income, and self-reported exposures to ionizing radiation and benzene. We found an 'n-shaped' response function between exposure to NO<inf>2</inf> and all forms of leukemia: from the tenth percentile to the median (4.51 to 14.66ppb), the OR was 1.20; 95% CI: 0.97-1.48 and from the 75th percentile to the 90th (22.75 to 29.7ppb), the OR was 0.79; 95% CI 0.68-0.93. For PM<inf>2.5</inf> we found a response function consistent with a linear model, with an OR per 10μg/m3 of 0.97 (95% CI 0.75-1.26). For chronic lymphocytic leukemia we found response functions that were consistent with a simple linear model, with an OR per 5ppb of NO<inf>2</inf> of 0.93 (95% CI 0.86-1.00) and an OR per 10μg/m3 of PM<inf>2.5</inf> of 0.62 (95% CI 0.42-0.93). In summary, for chronic lymphocytic leukemia we found no evidence of an association with air pollution and with all forms of leukemia we found weak evidence of an association only at low concentrations of NO<inf>2</inf>. It is possible that these inconsistent results may have arisen because of unaccounted urban/rural differences or possibly from a selection effect, especially among controls. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Adult leukemia; Air pollution; Case-control study; Epidemiology; Incidence","Akaike, H., (1998) Selected Papers of Hirotugu Akaike, pp. 199-213. , Springer, New York, (chap. 15), E.

Objectives: The aim of this research was to estimate the epidemiological and quality measures and resource use indicators in Hungary in four malignant conditions (breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer) from the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) database. Methods: Survival and cost analyses were performed on the NHIF database. Patient records containing the International Classification of Diseases (. ICD) codes C50 (breast cancer), C18-C20 (colorectal cancer), C33-C34 (lung cancer), and C61 (prostate cancer) were considered eligible. Inclusion criteria were at least two consecutive ICD codes between 2000 and 2012, with a minimum of 30-day difference, or one ICD code, followed by patient death within 60 days. A total of 428,860 social insurance numbers met inclusion criteria. Results: The number of new cases was 6381 for breast cancer, 8457 for colorectal cancer, 8902 for lung cancer, and 3419 for prostate cancer. The probability of 5-year overall survival from the first diagnosis was 75.2%, 41.3%, 17.1%, and 62.1%, respectively. Median time from first diagnosis to treatment initiation was less than 1 month in all conditions except for lung cancer. The annual cost of treatment was €2585, €3165, €4157, and €2834, respectively. Cost figures were compared with hemophilia as benchmark (€8284). Conclusions: The results indicated that the database of the Hungarian NHIF is suitable for real-world data analysis in the field of oncology and can support long-term evidence-based policymaking. © 2015 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).","Breast cancer; Colorectal cancer; Cost; Evidence-based policymaking; Hemophilia; Lung cancer; Mortality; New cases; Payer's database; Prostate cancer; Survival; Time to treatment","Girgis, A., Lambert, S., Johnson, C., Physical, psychosocial, relationship, and economic burden of caring for people with cancer: a review (2013) J Oncol Pract, 9, pp. 97-202; Bosanquet, N., Sikora, K., The economics of cancer care in the UK (2004) Lancet Oncol, 5, pp. 568-574; Are, C., Rajaram, S., Are, M., A review of global cancer burden: trends, challenges, strategies, and a role for surgeons (2013) J Surg Oncol, 107, pp. 221-226; Meropol, N.J., Schulman, K.A., Cost of cancer care: issues and implications (2007) J Clin Oncol, 25, pp. 180-186; Fojo, T., Grady, C., How much is life worth?

Firstly, a quinone derivative, the substrate of NQO1, is designed to be covalently immobilized on the surface of gold electrode. In the presence of the enzyme, the quinone derivative transforms to the corresponding hydroquinone derivative, followed by the expected cyclizative cleavage reaction via the gem-dialkyl effect. So, the hydroquinone derivative species are released from the electrode surface into the bulk solution. As the electrochemical probe, quinone derivative can generate a pair of redox waves in aqueous buffer and its peak current is correlated with the activity of NQO1, so an electrochemical method to determine the enzyme activity can be proposed. Under the optimized conditions, NQO1 activity can be assayed in the range from 0 to 6 U/mL with a detection limit of 0.22 U/mL. Moreover, resveratrol, an antitumor compound, is evaluated with the maximum inhibition rate of 95% and IC<inf>50</inf> value of 23.70 μM. Therefore, with wide detection range, high sensitivity, acceptable reliability and rapid response, the established method can be used for not only the investigation of NQO1 activity but also the screening of the enzyme inhibitor. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, p53 is also known to inhibit virus replication via enhanced type I interferon (IFN) antiviral responses. To examine whether p53 transgenes enhance antiviral signaling in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, we engineered novel VSV recombinants encoding human p53 or the previously described chimeric p53-CC, which contains the coiled-coil (CC) domain from breakpoint cluster region (BCR) protein and evades the dominant-negative activities of endogenously expressed mutant p53. Contrary to an expected enhancement of antiviral signaling by p53, our global analysis of gene expression in PDAC cells showed that both p53 and p53-CC dramatically inhibited type I IFN responses. Our data suggest that this occurs through p53-mediated inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Importantly, VSV-encoded p53 or p53-CC did not inhibit antiviral signaling in non-malignant human pancreatic ductal cells, which retained their resistance to all tested VSV recombinants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of p53-mediated inhibition of antiviral signaling, and it suggests that OV-encoded p53 can simultaneously produce anticancer activities while assisting, rather than inhibiting, virus replication in cancer cells. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Anticancer; Antiviral signaling; Gene therapy; Oncolytic; P53; Pancreatic cancer; Tumor suppressor; Type i interferon; Vesicular stomatitis virus; VSV","Ahmed, M., McKenzie, M.O., Puckett, S., Hojnacki, M., Poliquin, L., Lyles, D.S., Ability of the matrix protein of vesicular stomatitis virus to suppress beta interferon gene expression is genetically correlated with the inhibition of host RNA and protein synthesis (2003) J.

To migrate through the wide variety of environments they encounter, the cells must be able to remodel their cell shape efficiently to squeeze through small gaps in the extracellular matrix or extravasate into the blood stream or lymphatic system. Several studies have shown that the nucleus is the main limiting factor to migration through small gaps (Wolf et al., 2013; Harada et al., 2014; Mak et al., 2013). To understand the physical limits of cancer cell translocation in confined environments, we have fabricated a microfluidic device to study their ability to adapt their nuclear and cellular shape when passing through small gaps. The device is open access for ease of use and enables examination of the effect of different levels of spatial confinement on cell behaviour and morphology simultaneously. The results show that increasing cell confinement decreases the ability of cells to translocate into small gaps and that cells cannot penetrate into the microchannels below a threshold cross-section. © 2015 The Authors.

In DNA circular amplification detection system, hairpin DNA beacon/Au NPs composite modified CdS NCs film was used as an ECL emitter. Messenger DNA is hybridized with the aptamer modified on magnetic beads (MBs) to form MB-Au bioconjugates. In the presence of HL-60 cell, the aptamer would conjugate with the glycoprotein at cell surface and messenger DNA sequence would be released. The released messenger DNA sequence was then introduced into the cycle amplification system to trigger circular polymerizations. This assay allows us to determine the released messenger DNA equivalent to 10 cells and exhibits a significant specificity for HL-60 cells. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we report losses in expression of the miRNA miR30a, which is downregulated in ATC compared with differentiated thyroid cancer and normal tissue. miR30a downregulation was associated with advanced differentiated thyroid cancer and higher mortality. Mechanistically, we found miR30a decreased cellular invasion and migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker levels, lysyl oxidase (LOX) expression, and metastatic capacity. LOX was identified as a direct target of miR30a that was overexpressed in ATC and associated with advanced differentiated thyroid cancer and higher mortality rate. Consistent with its role in other cancers, we found that LOX inhibited cell proliferation, cellular invasion, and migration and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Together, our findings establish a critical functional role for miR30a downregulation in mediating LOX upregulation and thyroid cancer progression, with implications for LOX targeting as a rational therapeutic strategy in ATC. ©2014 AACR.",,"Smallridge, R.C., Ain, K.B., Asa, S.L., Bible, K.C., Brierley, J.D., Burman, K.D., American Thyroid Association guidelines for management of patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (2012) Thyroid, 22, pp. 1104-1139; Kebebew, E., Greenspan, F.S., Clark, O.H., Woeber, K.A., McMillan, A., Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.

As TAAs are highly expressed in placental tissues we hypothesized that pregnancy could drive respective immunity in healthy individuals. Thus,weinvestigated the frequency and level of immune responses against clinically relevant TAAs in 114 blood donors and 44 women during their first pregnancy. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was employed to detect low levels of interferon-γ after primary peptide stimulation of CD8+ T lymphocytes. In blood donors, primary immune responses of low and/or high avidity were found againstWT1(15%), MUC1(14%), PRAME(7%), and HER2/neu (5%) and exerted killing functions against leukemic cells.Menhadhigher responses thanwomen,likely due to gonadal cancer-testis-antigen expression. Interestingly, a history of prior deliverywasnot associated with increased responses, whereasthe strongest responses during pregnancy werefound in early trimesters to disappear after delivery. This boost and loss of TAA-specific immunity suggests that virtually every donor harbors the potential to mount antileukemic immune responses in a recipient. However, in the absence of the driving target and a permissive environment, they are short-lived and thus require supplemental strategies such as vaccination or immunomodulation to facilitate their persistence. © 2015 by The American Society of Hematology",,"Weiden, P.L., Flournoy, N., Thomas, E.D., Antileukemic effect of graft-versus-host disease in human recipients of allogeneic-marrow grafts (1979) N Engl J Med, 300 (19), pp. 1068-1073;

Agr2 is overexpressed in adenocarcinomas of various organs, where it participates in neoplastic transformation and metastasis, therefore acts as a pro-oncogenic protein. Besides its normal localization in the ER, Agr2 is also found in the serum and urine of cancer patients, although the physiological significance of extracellular Agr2 is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that extracellular Agr2 can activate stromal fibroblasts and promote fibroblast-associated cancer invasion in gastric signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC), where Agr2 is highly expressed. Agr2 secreted from SRCC cells was incorporated by the surrounding gastric fibroblasts and promoted invasion by these cells. In turn, activated fibroblasts coordinated the invasive behavior of fibroblasts and cancer cells. Our findings suggested that Agr2 drives progression of gastric SRCC by exerting paracrine effects on fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment, acting also to increase the growth and resistance of SRCC cells to oxidative and hypoxic stress as cell autonomous effects. ©2014 AACR.",,"Lauren, P., The two histological main types of gastric carcinoma: Diffuse and so called intestinal-type carcinoma: An attempt at a histo-clinical classification (1965) Acta Pathol Microbiol Scand, 64, pp. 31-49; Hu, B., Hajj, N.E., Sittler, S., Lammert, N., Barnes, R., Meloni-Ehrig, A., Gastric cancer: Classification, histology and application of molecular pathology (2012) J Gastrointest Oncol, 3, pp. 251-261; Henson, D.E., Dittus, C., Younes, M., Nguyen, H., Albores-Saavedra, J., Differential trends in the intestinal and diffuse types of gastric carcinoma in the United States, 1973-2000.

In the present study, we performed a global expression analysis of breast cancer cells in which the tumor-suppressor candidate gene TUSC4 was silenced to gain insights into its function. TUSC4 silencing affected genes involved in cell cycle and cell death, which have broad reaching influence on cancer development. Most importantly, we found a cluster pattern of gene-expression profiles in TUSC4-silenced cells that defined a homologous recombination (HR) repair defect signature. Mechanistic investigations indicated that TUSC4 protein could physically interact with the E3 ligase Herc2, which prevents BRCA1 degradation through the ubiquitination pathway. TUSC4 silencing enhanced BRCA1 polyubiquitination, leading to its degradation and a marked reduction in HR repair efficiency. Notably, ectopic expression of TUSC4 suppressed the proliferation, invasion, and colony formation of breast cancer cells in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo.

However, whereas HIF1 has a tumor-suppressor role, HIF2 plays a distinct role in driving CRCC. In this study, we show that the HIF1α E3 ligase hypoxia-associated factor (HAF) complexes with HIF2α at DNA to promote HIF2-dependent transcription through a mechanism relying upon HAF SUMOylation. HAF SUMOylation was induced by hypoxia, whereas HAF-mediated HIF1α degradation was SUMOylation independent. HAF overexpression in mice increased CRCC growth and metastasis. Clinically, HAF overexpression was associated with poor prognosis. Taken together, our results show that HAF is a specific mediator of HIF2 activation that is critical for CRCC development and morbidity. © 2014 AACR.",,"Wilson, W.R., Hay, M.P., Targeting hypoxia in cancer therapy (2011) Nat Rev Cancer, 11, pp. 393-410; Koh, M.Y., Powis, G., Passing the baton: The HIF switch (2012) Trends Biochem Sci, 37, pp. 364-372; Holmquist-Mengelbier, L., Fredlund, E., Lofstedt, T., Noguera, R., Navarro, S., Nilsson, H., Recruitment of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha to common target genes is differentially regulated in neuroblastoma: HIF-2alpha promotes an aggressive phenotype (2006) Cancer Cell, 10, pp. 413-423; Koh, M.Y., Lemos, R., Jr., Liu, X., Powis, G., The hypoxia-associated factor switches cells from HIF-1{alpha}- to HIF-2{alpha}-dependent signaling promoting stem cell characteristics, aggressive tumor growth and invasion (2011) Cancer Res, 71, pp. 4015-4027; Keith, B., Johnson, R.S., Simon, M.C., HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha: Sibling rivalry in hypoxic tumour growth and progression (2012) Nat Rev Cancer, 12, pp. 9-22; Koh, M.Y., Darnay, B.G., Powis, G., Hypoxia-associated factor, a novel E3-ubiquitin ligase, binds and ubiquitinates hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha, leading to its oxygen-independent degradation (2008) Mol Cell Biol, 28, pp. 7081-7095; Gnarra, J.R., Tory, K., Weng, Y., Schmidt, L., Wei, M.H., Li, H., Mutations of the VHL tumour suppressor gene in renal carcinoma (1994) Nat Genet, 7, pp. 85-90; Moore, L.E., Nickerson, M.L., Brennan, P., Toro, J.R., Jaeger, E., Rinsky, J., Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) inactivation in sporadic clear cell renal cancer: Associations with germline VHL polymorphisms and etiologic risk factors (2011) PLoS Genet, 7; Banks, R.E., Tirukonda, P., Taylor, C., Hornigold, N., Astuti, D., Cohen, D., Genetic and epigenetic analysis of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene alterations and relationship with clinical variables in sporadic renal cancer (2006) Cancer Res, 66, pp. 2000-2011; Wang, G.L., Jiang, B.H., Rue, E.A., Semenza, G.L., Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 is a basic-helix-loop-helix-PAS heterodimer regulated by cellular O2 tension (1995) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 92, pp. 5510-5514; Baldewijns, M.M., Van Vlodrop, I.J., Vermeulen, P.B., Soetekouw, P.M., Van Engeland, M., De Bruine, A.P., VHL and HIF signalling in renal cell carcinogenesis (2010) J Pathol, 221, pp. 125-138; Welford, S.M., Dorie, M.J., Li, X., Haase, V.H., Giaccia, A.J., Renal oxygenation suppresses VHL loss-induced senescence that is caused by increased sensitivity to oxidative stress (2010) Mol Cell Biol, 30, pp. 4595-4603; Bratslavsky, G., Sudarshan, S., Neckers, L., Linehan, W.M., Pseudohypoxic pathways in renal cell Carcinoma (2007) Clin Cancer Res, 13, pp. 4667-4671; Chen, Y., Zhang, J., Dai, J., Feng, X., Lu, H., Zhou, C., Angiogenesis of renal cell carcinoma: Perfusion CT findings (2010) Abdom Imaging, 35, pp. 622-628; Mandriota, S.J., Turner, K.J., Davies, D.R., Murray, P.G., Morgan, N.V., Sowter, H.M., HIF activation identifies early lesions in VHL kidneys: Evidence for site-specific tumor suppressor function in the nephron (2002) Cancer Cell, 1, pp. 459-468; Schietke, R.E., Hackenbeck, T., Tran, M., Gunther, R., Klanke, B., Warnecke, C.L., Renal tubular HIF-2alpha expression requires VHL inactivation and causes fibrosis and cysts (2012) PLoS ONE, 7; Turner, K.J., Moore, J.W., Jones, A., Taylor, C.F., Cuthbert-Heavens, D., Han, C., Expression of hypoxia-inducible factors in human renal cancer: Relationship to angiogenesis and to the von Hippel-Lindau gene mutation (2002) Cancer Res, 62, pp. 2957-2961; Gordan, J.D., Lal, P., Dondeti, V.R., Letrero, R., Parekh, K.N., Oquendo, C.E., HIF-alpha effects on c-Myc distinguish two subtypes of sporadic VHL-defi cient clear cell renal carcinoma (2008) Cancer Cell, 14, pp. 435-446; Kondo, K., Kim, W.Y., Lechpammer, M., Kaelin, W.G., Jr., Inhibition of HIF2alpha is sufficient to suppress pVHL-defective tumor growth (2003) PLoS Biol, 1, p.

Especially for targeted therapies, large variations between individual treatment responses exist. Predicting therapy response is of utmost significance, as it prevents overtreatment and adverse effects in patients. For EGFRtargeted therapy, many mechanisms of resistance have been uncovered, for example, mutations in KRAS and BRAF, and upregulation of alternative receptors. Currently, routine testing for all known modifiers of response is unpractical, and as a result, decision-making for anti-EGFR therapy is still largely based on assessing the mutation status of an individual gene (KRAS). Recently, comprehensive classifications of colorectal cancer have been presented that integrate many of the (epi-)genetic and microenvironmental factors that contribute to colorectal cancer heterogeneity. These classification systems are not only of prognostic value but also predict therapy efficacy, including the response to anti-EGFR agents. Therefore, molecular subtype-based stratification to guide therapeutic decisions is a promising new strategy that might overcome the shortcomings of single gene testing in colorectal cancer as well as in other malignancies. Furthermore, the development of new agents in a disease subtype-specific fashion has the potential to transform drug-discovery studies and generate novel, more effective therapies. © 2014 American Association for Cancer Research",,"De Roock, W., Claes, B., Bernasconi, D., De Schutter, J., Biesmans, B., Fountzilas, G., Effects of KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA mutations on the efficacy of cetuximab plus chemotherapy in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer: A retrospective consortium analysis (2010) Urol Oncol, 11, pp. 753-762;

Patients with at least 1 stage-modified adverse risk factor (nonbulky stage II, age >60 years, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, or World Health Organization performance status of 2) were treated with CHOPon days 1, 22, and 43, followed 3 weeks later by 40 to 50 Gy of IFRT. An ibritumomab tiuxetan regimen was initiated 3 to 6 weeks following IFRT. Forty-six patients were registered and eligible, with median follow-up of 7.3 years. The progression-free survival estimate is89%at 2 years,82%at 5 years, and75% at 7 years. The overall survival estimate is 91% at 2 years, 87% at 5 years, and 82% at 7 years. Grade 4 adverse events occurring more than once included neutropenia (8), leukopenia (5), and lymphopenia (2). Febrile neutropenia was observed in 4 patients. No cases of treatment-related myeloid neoplasms were noted. In conclusion, patients with high-risk LD-NHL treated with 3 cycles of CHOP plus IFRT followed by ibritumomab tiuxetan consolidation had outcomes that compare favorably to our historical experience.

To gain insight into the function of this large gene family, we developed an antibody that recognizes the conserved zinc fingers linker region (ZnFL) in multiple KRAB-ZNF. Here, we report that the expression of many KRAB-ZNF along with active SUMOlyated KAP1 is elevated widely inhuman breast cancers. KAP1 silencing in breast cancer cells reduced proliferation and inhibited the growth and metastasis of tumor xenografts. Conversely, KAP1 overexpression stimulated cell proliferation and tumor growth. In cells where KAP1 was silenced, we identified multiple downregulated genes linked to tumor progression and metastasis, including EREG/epiregulin, PTGS2/COX2, MMP1, MMP2, and CD44, along with downregulation of multiple KRAB-ZNF proteins. KAP1-dependent stabilization of KRAB-ZNF required direct interactions with KAP1. Together, our results show that KAP1-mediated stimulation of multiple KRAB-ZNF contributes to the growth and metastasis of breast cancer. © 2014 AACR.",,"Vaquerizas, J.M., Kummerfeld, S.K., Teichmann, S.A., Luscombe, N.M., A census of human transcription factors: Function, expression and evolution (2009) Nat Rev Genet, 10, pp. 252-263;

Although imaging techniques have considerably improved our understanding of metastasis, early events remain challenging to study due to the small numbers of malignant cells involved that are often undetectable. Using a novel zebrafish model to investigate this process, we discovered that tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) acted to facilitate metastasis by binding tumor cells and mediating their intravasation. Mechanistic investigations revealed that IL6 and TNFα promoted the ability of macrophages to mediate this step. M2 macrophages were particularly potent when induced by IL4, IL10, and TGFβ. In contrast, IFNγ-lipopolysaccharide-induced M1 macrophages lacked the capability to function in the same way in the model. Confirming these observations, we found that human TAM isolated from primary breast, lung, colorectal, and endometrial cancers exhibited a similar capability in invasion and metastasis. Taken together, our work shows how zebrafish can be used to study how host contributions can facilitate metastasis at its earliest stages, and they reveal a new macrophage-dependent mechanism of metastasis with possible prognostic implications. ©2014 AACR.",,"Valastyan, S., Weinberg, R.A., Tumor metastasis: Molecular insights and evolving paradigms (2011) Cell, 147, pp. 275-292;

Recent data suggest that high insulin levels in overweight women may play a major role in this relationship, due to insulin's mitogenic/antiapoptotic activity. However, whether overweight women who are metabolically healthy (i.e., normal insulin sensitivity) have elevated risk of breast cancer is unknown. We investigated whether overweight women with normal insulin sensitivity [i.e., homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, or fasting insulin level, within the lowest quartile (q1)] have increased breast cancer risk. Subjects were incident breast cancer cases ( N = 497) and a subcohort ( N = 2,830) of Women's Health Initiative (WHI) participants with available fasting insulin and glucose levels. In multivariate Cox models, metabolically healthy overweight women, defined using HOMA-IR, were not at elevated risk of breast cancer compared with metabolically healthy normal weight women [HR HOMA-IR, 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.64-1.42]. In contrast, the risk among women with high (q3-4) HOMA-IRs was elevated whether they were overweight (HRHOMA-IR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.19-2.60) or normal weight ( HRHOMA-IR , 1.80; 95% CI, 0.88 - 3.70). Similarly, using fasting insulin to define metabolic health, metabolically unhealthy women (insulin q3-4) were at higher risk of breast cancer regardless of whether they were normal weight (HRinsulin, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.01-4.22) or overweight (HRinsulin, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.35- 2.99), whereas metabolically healthy overweight women did not have significantly increased risk of breast cancer (HRinsulin , 0.96; 95% CI, 0.64- 1.42) relative to metabolically healthy normal weight women.

Recipients of JAK2V617F cells developed primary myelofibrosis-like features; the addition of loss of TET2 worsened this JAK2V617F-induced disease, causing prolonged leukocytosis, splenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and modestly shorter survival. Double-mutant (JAK2V617F plus loss of TET2) myeloid cells were more likely to be in a proliferative state than JAK2V617F single-mutant myeloid cells. In a serial competitive transplantation assay, JAK2V617F cells resulted in decreased chimerism in the second recipients, which did not develop MPNs. In marked contrast, cooperation between JAK2V617F and loss of TET2 developed and maintained MPNs in the second recipients by compensating for impaired hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) functioning. In-vitro sequential colony formation assays also supported the observation that JAK2V617F did not maintain HSC functioning over the long-term, but concurrent loss of TET2 mutation restored it. Transcriptional profiling revealed that loss of TET2 affected the expression of many HSC signature genes. We conclude that loss of TET2 has two different roles in MPNs: disease accelerator and disease initiator and sustainer in combination with JAK2V617F. © 2015 by The American Society of Hematology",,"James, C., Ugo, V., Le Couédic, J.P., A unique clonal JAK2 mutation leading to constitutive signalling causes polycythaemia vera (2005) Nature, 434 (7037), pp. 1144-1148;

We expressed the R195H mutant of Drosophila Idh (CG7176), which is equivalent to the human cancer-associated IDH1-R132H mutant, in fly tissues using the UAS-Gal4 binary expression system. Idh-R195H caused a >25-fold elevation of D-2HG when expressed ubiquitously in flies. Expression of mutant Idh in larval blood cells (hemocytes) resulted in higher numbers of circulating blood cells. Mutant Idh expression in fly neurons resulted in neurologic and wing-expansion defects, and these phenotypes were rescued by genetic modulation of superoxide dismutase 2, p53, and apoptotic caspase cascade mediators. Idh-R163Q, which is homologous to the common leukemia-associated IDH2-R140Q mutant, resulted in moderately elevated D-2HG and milder phenotypes. We identified the fly homolog of D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid dehydrogenase (CG3835), which metabolizes D-2HG, and showed that coexpression of this enzyme with mutant Idh abolishes mutant Idh-associated phenotypes. These results provide a flexible model system to interrogate a cancer-related genetic and metabolic pathway and offer insights into the impact of IDH mutation and D-2HG on metazoan tissues. © 2015 by The American Society of Hematology",,"Yan, H., Parsons, D.W., Jin, G., IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in gliomas (2009) N Engl J Med, 360 (8), pp. 765-773;

In many cellular and preclinical models of cancer, eIF4F deregulation results in changes in translational efficiency of specific mRNA classes. Importantly, many of these mRNAs code for proteins that potently regulate critical cellular processes, such as cell growth and proliferation, enhanced cell survival and cell migration that ultimately impinge on several hallmarks of cancer, including increased angiogenesis, deregulated growth control, enhanced cellular survival, epithelial-tomesenchymal transition, invasion, and metastasis. By being positioned as the molecular nexus downstream of key oncogenic signaling pathways (e.g., Ras, PI3K/AKT/TOR, and MYC), eIF4F serves as a direct link between important steps in cancer development and translation initiation. Identification of mRNAs particularly responsive to elevated eIF4F activity that typifies tumorigenesis underscores the critical role of eIF4F in cancer and raises the exciting possibility of developing new-in-class small molecules targeting translation initiation as antineoplastic agents. ©2014 AACR",,"Hershey, J.W., Sonenberg, N., Mathews, M.B., Principles of translational control: An overview (2012) Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol, 4. , pii: a011528;

Here, we demonstrate that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) increase the stiffness of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and promote anisotropic fiber orientation, two mechanical signals generated through a Snail1/RhoA/αSMA-dependent mechanism that sustains oriented tumor cell migration and invasiveness. Snail1-depleted CAF failed to acquire myofibroblastic traits in response to TGFβ, including RhoA activation, αSMA-positive stress fibers, increased fibronectin fibrillogenesis, and production of a stiff ECM with oriented fibers. Snail1 expression in human tumor-derived CAF was associated with an ability to organize the ECM. In coculture, a relatively smaller number of Snail1-expressing CAF were capable of imposing an anisotropic ECM architecture, compared with nonactivated fibroblasts. Pathologically, human breast cancers with Snail1+ CAF tended to exhibit desmoplastic areas with anisotropic fibers, lymph node involvement, and poorer outcomes. Snail1 involvement in driving an ordered ECM was further confirmed in wound-healing experiments in mice, with Snail1 depletion preventing the anisotropic organization of granulation tissue and delaying wound healing. Overall, our results showed that inhibiting Snail1 function in CAF could prevent tumor-driven ECM reorganization and cancer invasion. ©2014 AACR.",,"Hinz, B., The myofibroblast: Paradigm for a mechanically active cell (2010) J Biomech, 43, pp. 146-155;

Pharmacologic inhibition of the serine/ threonine kinase Akt has recently been shown to promote immunologic memory in virus-specific murine models, but whether this approach enhances features of memory (e.g., long-term persistence) in TIL that are characteristically exhausted and senescent is not established. Here, we show that pharmacologic inhibition of Akt enables expansion of TIL with the transcriptional, metabolic, and functional properties characteristic of memory T cells. Consequently, Akt inhibition results in enhanced persistence of TIL after adoptive transfer into an immunodeficient animal model and augments antitumor immunity of CD8 T cells in a mouse model of cell-based immunotherapy. Pharmacologic inhibition of Akt represents a novel immunometabolomic approach to enhance the persistence of antitumor T cells and improve the efficacy of cell-based immunotherapy for metastatic cancer. © 2014 AACR.",,"Smyth, M.J., Dunn, G.P., Schreiber, R.D., Cancer immunosurveillance and immunoediting: The roles of immunity in suppressing tumor development and shaping tumor immunogenicity (2006) Adv Immunol, 90, pp. 1-50;

The introduction of CRC screening programmes using stool tests and flexible sigmoidoscopy, have been shown to reduce CRC-related mortality substantially. In several European countries, population-based CRC screening programmes are ongoing or being rolled out. Stool tests like faecal occult blood testing are non-invasive and simple to perform, but are primarily designed to detect early invasive cancer. More invasive tests like colonoscopy and CT colonography (CTC) aim at accurately detecting both CRC and cancer precursors, thus providing for cancer prevention. This review focuses on the accuracy, acceptance and safety of CTC as a CRC screening technique and on the current position of CTC in organised population screening. Based on the detection characteristics and acceptability of CTC screening, it might be a viable screening test. The potential disadvantage of radiation exposure is probably overemphasised, especially with newer technology. At this time-point, it is not entirely clear whether the detection of extracolonic findings at CTC is of net benefit and is cost effective, but with responsible handling, this may be the case. Future efforts will seek to further improve the technique, refine appropriate diagnostic algorithms and study cost-effectiveness.",,"Heresbach, D., Manfredi, S., D'Halluin, P.N., Review in depth and meta-analysis of controlled trials on colorectal cancer screening by faecal occult blood test (2006) Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol, 18, pp. 427-433;

Methods: We analysed data from the BCSP's Southern Hub for individuals (n=62 099) aged 60-64 years at the time of first invitation to screening with a follow-up period that allowed for two further biennial invitations. Data on sex, age and a neighbourhood-level measure of socioeconomic deprivation were used in the analysis. Outcomes included uptake of guaiac-based faecal occult blood (gFOB) test screening, inadequate gFOB screening (≥1 test kit(s) returned but failed to complete further gFOB tests needed to reach a conclusive test result), test positivity, compliance with follow-up examinations (usually colonoscopy) and diagnostic outcomes. Results: Overall gFOB uptake was 57.4% in the first, 60.9% in the second and 66.2% in third biennial invitation round. This resulted in 70.1% of the initial cohort having responded at least once, 60.7% at least twice and 44.4% three times. Participation in the first round was strongly predictive of participation in the second round ('Previous Responders ': 86.6% vs 'Previous Non-Responders': 23.1%). Participation in the third round was highest among 'Consistent Screeners' (94.5%), followed by 'Late Entrants ' (78.0%), 'Dropouts' (59.8%) and 'Consistent Non-Responders' (14.6%). Socioeconomic inequalities in uptake were observed across the three rounds, but sex inequalities decreased over rounds. Inadequate gFOB screening was influenced by screening history and socioeconomic deprivation. Screening history was the only significant predictor of follow-up compliance. Conclusions: Screening history is associated with overall gFOB uptake, inadequate gFOB screening and follow-up compliance. Socioeconomic deprivation is also consistently associated with lower gFOB uptake and inadequate gFOB screening.

Recent studies have shown that expression of the IDH mutant enzymes results in high levels of 2HG and a block in cellular differentiation that can be reversed with IDH mutant-specific small-molecule inhibitors. To further understand the role of IDH mutations in cancer, we conducted mechanistic studies in the TF-1 IDH2 R140Q erythroleukemia model system and found that IDH2 mutant expression caused both histone and genomic DNA methylation changes that can be reversed when IDH2mutant activity is inhibited. Specifically, histone hypermethylation is rapidly reversed within days, whereas reversal of DNA hypermethylation proceeds in a progressive manner over the course of weeks. We identified several gene signatures implicated in tumorigenesis of leukemia and lymphoma, indicating a selective modulation of relevant cancer genes by IDH mutations. As methylation of DNA and histones is closely linked to mRNA expression and differentiation, these results indicate that IDH2 mutant inhibition may function as a cancer therapy via histone and DNA demethylation at genes involved in differentiation and tumorigenesis. © 2015 by The American Society of Hematology",,"Dang, L., White, D.W., Gross, S., Cancer-associated IDH1 mutations produce 2-hydroxyglutarate (2009) Nature, 462 (7274), pp. 739-744; Yen, K.E., Bittinger, M.A., Su, S.M., Fantin, V.R., Cancer-associated IDH mutations: Biomarker and therapeutic opportunities (2010) Oncogene, 29 (49), pp. 6409-6417; Dang, L., White, D.W., Gross, S., Cancer-associated IDH1 mutations produce 2-hydroxyglutarate (2010) Nature, 465 (7300), p. 966; Turcan, S., Rohle, D., Goenka, A., IDH1 mutation is sufficient to establish the glioma hypermethylator phenotype (2012) Nature, 483 (7390), pp. 479-483; Figueroa, M.E., Abdel-Wahab, O., Lu, C., Leukemic IDH1 and IDH2 mutations result in a hypermethylation phenotype, disrupt TET2 function, and impair hematopoietic differentiation (2010) Cancer Cell, 18 (6), pp. 553-567; Yamane, K., Toumazou, C., Tsukada, Y., JHDM2A, a JmjC-containing H3K9 demethylase, facilitates transcription activation by androgen receptor (2006) Cell, 125 (3), pp. 483-495; Tsukada, Y., Fang, J., Erdjument-Bromage, H., Histone demethylation by a family of JmjC domain-containing proteins (2006) Nature, 439 (7078), pp. 811-816; Rohle, D., Popovici-Muller, J., Palaskas, N., An inhibitor of mutant IDH1 delays growth and promotes differentiation of glioma cells (2013) Science, 340 (6132), pp. 626-630; Wang, F., Travins, J., DeLaBarre, B., Targeted inhibition of mutant IDH2 in leukemia cells induces cellular differentiation (2013) Science, 340 (6132), pp. 622-626; Losman, J.A., Looper, R.E., Koivunen, P., (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate is sufficient to promote leukemogenesis and its effects are reversible (2013) Science, 339 (6127), pp. 1621-1625; Chowdhury, R., Yeoh, K.K., Tian, Y.M., The oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate inhibits histone lysine demethylases (2011) EMBO Rep, 12 (5), pp. 463-469; Sean Davis, P.D., Sven, B., Tim, T., Bootwalla, M., Jr., (2012) Methylumi: Handle Illumina Methylation Data; Aryee, M.J., Jaffe, A.E., Corrada-Bravo, H., Minfi: A flexible and comprehensive Bioconductor package for the analysis of Infinium DNA methylation microarrays (2014) Bioinformatics, 30 (10), pp. 1363-1369; Aryee, K.D.H.M., (2011) Minfi: Analyze Illumina's 450k Methylation Arrays; Storey, J.D., Tibshirani, R., Statistical significance for genomewide studies (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 100 (16), pp. 9440-9445; Du, P., Zhang, X., Huang, C.C., Comparison of Beta-value and M-value methods for quantifying methylation levels by microarray analysis (2010) BMC Bioinformatics, 11, p. 587; Cox, T.F., Cox, M.A.A., (2001) Multidimensional Scaling, , 2nd edition.

In particular, it is unresolved how HPV-infected keratinocytes escape cell-cycle control and whether their cross-talk with immune cells is critical for tumorigenesis. In nonviral preclinical models, the angiogenic cytokine VEGF-A has been identified as a critical regulator of NMSC. In this study, we dissected the contribution of epidermal versus myeloid cell-derived VEGF-A in HPV-mediated skin cancer by interbreeding an HPV8 transgenic mouse model with a conditional disruption of VEGF-A restricted to either epidermal or myeloid cells. Although only epidermal-derived VEGF-A was essential for initiation of skin tumor development, both spontaneously and UV-light triggered, both epidermal and myeloid cell-derived VEGF-A contributed to regeneration-induced tumorigenesis upon HPV8 overexpression, partly not only through a paracrine effect on endothelial cells, but also most probably through an additional autocrine effect on epidermal cells. Our findings offer new mechanistic insights into distinct functions of epidermal versus myeloid cell-derived VEGF-A during HPV-mediated tumorigenesis, with possible implications for preventing this disease. © 2014 AACR.",,"De Villiers, E.M., Cross-roads in the classification of papillomaviruses (2013) Virology, 445, pp. 2-10;

These methyltransferases are ideal therapeutic targets due to their frequent hyperactive mutations and overexpression found in cancer, including hematopoietic malignancies. Here,we characterized a set of small molecules that allow pharmacologic manipulation of EZH2 and EZH1, which include UNC1999, a selective inhibitor of both enzymes, and UNC2400, an inactive analog compound useful for assessment of off-target effect. UNC1999 suppresses global H3K27 trimethylation/dimethylation (H3K27me3/2) and inhibits growth of mixed lineage leukemia ( MLL ) - rearranged leukemia cells. UNC1999-induced transcriptome alterations overlap those following knockdown of embryonic ectoderm development, a common cofactor of EZH2 and EZH1, demonstrating UNC1999's on-target inhibition. Mechanistically, UNC1999 preferentially affects distal regulatory elements such as enhancers, leading to derepression of polycomb targets including Cdkn2a. Gene derepression correlates with a decrease in H3K27me3 and concurrent gain in H3K27 acetylation. UNC2400 does not induce such effects. Oral administration of UNC1999 prolongs survival of a well-defined murine leukemia model bearing MLL-AF9. Collectively, our study provides the detailed profiling for a set of chemicals to manipulate EZH2 and EZH1 and establishes specific enzymatic inhibition of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-EZH2 and PRC2-EZH1 by small-molecule compounds as a novel therapeutics for MLL-rearranged leukemia. © 2015 by The American Society of Hematology",,"Chi, P., Allis, C.D., Wang, G.G., Covalent histone modifications-miswritten, misinterpreted and mis-erased in human cancers (2010) Nat Rev Cancer, 10 (7), pp. 457-469;

Here we have synthesized a serious of six squaraine dyes consisting of two different electron donor moiety i.e. 1,1,2-trimethyl-1H-benzo[e]indole and 2-methylbenzo[d]thiazole which modulates the chemisorptions and hydrophobicity being designated as SQ1, SQ2, SQ3, SQ4, SQ5 and SQ6. Interestingly, SQ2 (mono lipoic acid appended), SQ5 and SQ6 (conjugated with hexyl and dodecyl side chain) squaraine derivatives having more tendency of aggregation in DMSO-water mixed solvent showed significant increase of Raman scattering in the fingerprint region when chemisorbed on spherical gold nanoparticles. Two sets of SERS nanotags were prepared with colloidal gold nanoparticle (Au-NPs size: 40. nm) by incorporating Raman reporters SQ2 and SQ5 followed by thiolated PEG encapsulation (SH-PEG, SH-PEG-COOH) denoted as AuNPs-SQ2-PEG and AuNPs-SQ5-PEG. Further conjugation of these nanotag with monoclonal antibodies specific to over expressed receptors, EGFR and p16/Ki-67 in cervical cancer cell, HeLa showed prominent SERS mapping intensity and selectivity towards cell surface and nucleus. The fast and accurate recognition obtained by antibody triggered SERS-nanotag has been compared with conventional time consuming immunocytochemistry technique which prompted us to extend further investigation using real patient cervical smear sample for a non-invasive, ultrafast and accurate diagnosis. © 2015.","Aggregation; Immunocytochemistry; Raman mapping; Raman scattering; SERS nanotag; Squaraine dye","Anees, P., Sreejith, S., Ajayaghosh, A., (2014) J.

A sandwich format involving the covalent immobilization of a specific capture antibody onto magnetic beads (MBs) and incubation of the modified MBs with a mixture solution of the antigen and a HRP-labeled detector antibody was used. The resulting modified MBs were captured on the surface of a disposable screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) and the amperometric responses at -0.20V were measured. This ErbB2 magnetoimmunosensor exhibited a very low detection limit of 26pgmL-1 far below the established cut-off for this biomarker (15ngmL-1) and was successfully applied to the quantitation of ErbB2 in human serum and cell lysates samples without any matrix effect. In addition, the developed assay allowed the assessment of ErbB2 status directly in intact breast cancer cells. The results correlated well with those obtained with a commercial ELISA method, thus demonstrating that the new magnetoimmunosensing platform offers a truthful and useful analytical tool to be easily applied in breast cancer diagnosis through either ErbB2 protein determination or breast cancer cell status detection. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Amperometry; Breast cancer; ErbB2; Intact cancer cells; Lysates; Magnetoimmunosensor; Serum","Aguilar, Z., Akita, R.W., Finn, R.S., Ramos, B.L., Pegram, M.D., Kabbinavar, F.F., Pietras, R.J., Slamon, D.J., (1999) Oncogene, 18, pp. 6050-6062; Al-Khafaji, Q.A.M., Harris, M., Tombelli, S., Laschi, S., Turner, A.P.F., Mascini, M., Marrazza, G., (2012) Electroanalysis, 24, pp. 735-742; Barderas, R., Mendes, M., Torres, S., Bartolome, R.A., Lopez-Lucendo, M., Villar-Vazquez, R., Pelaez-Garcia, A., Casal, J.I., (2013) Mol.

The CGN were fabricated through a simple microwave-assisted carbonization of glucose and deposition of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). This nanocomposite showed great adsorption ability to the redox probes such as some organic dyes and metal ions, due to the abundant reactive oxygen functional groups on its surface. The AuNPs decorated on the nanocomposite provided extra binding sites for the three antibodies carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), prostate specific antigen (PSA), α-fetoprotein (AFP), respectively. The ionic liquid reduced graphene oxide was combined with poly(sodium-p-styrenesulfonate) as substrate to attach the three different antibodies through electrostatic adsorption. Three separate signals can be detected directly in a single run through square wave voltammetry. Under optimized conditions, the electrochemical immunosensor exhibited good sensitivity and selectivity for the simultaneous determination of CEA, PSA and AFP with linear ranges of 0.01-100ngmL-1. The detection limit for CEA, PSA and AFP is 2.7, 4.8 and 3.1pgmL-1, respectively. This method was applied for the analysis of CEA, PSA and AFP levels in clinical serum samples, and the results were in good agreement with those of enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This approach gives a promising simple and sensitive immunoassay strategy for the identification and validation of specific early cancer. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer; Carbon-gold nanocomposite; Electrochemical immunosensor; Multiplexed electrochemical detection; Tumor marker","Cao, X., Wang, N., Jia, S., Guo, L., Li, K., (2013) Biosens.

It has also been considered as a potent anticancer agent. However, the molecular mechanism of action of β-SITO as a tubulin-binding anticancer agent and its binding site on tubulin are poorly understood. Using a combination of biochemical analyses and molecular dynamic simulation, we investigated the molecular details of the binding interactions of β-SITO with tubulin. A polymer mass assay comparing the effects of β-SITO and of taxol and vinblastine on tubulin assembly showed that this phytosterol stabilized microtubule assembly in a manner similar to taxol. An 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid assay confirmed the direct interaction of β-SITO with tubulin. Although β-SITO did not show direct binding to the colchicine site on tubulin, it stabilized the colchicine binding. Interestingly, no sulfhydryl groups of tubulin were involved in the binding interaction of β-SITO with tubulin. Based on the results from the biochemical assays, we computationally modeled the binding of β-SITO with tubulin. Using molecular docking followed by molecular dynamic simulations, we found that β-SITO binds tubulin at a novel site (which we call the 'SITO site') adjacent to the colchicine and noscapine sites. Our data suggest that β-SITO is a potent anticancer compound that interferes with microtubule assembly dynamics by binding to a novel site on tubulin. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The first survey was carried out in 1996, and since then monitoring has been undertaken every five years. Whilst the sampling site is a relatively small town, industrial activities (mainly the steel industry and Zn and Al metallurgy) and other less significant urban sources, such as traffic, strongly affect the load of heavy metals in the urban aerosol. Elemental tracers have been used to characterise the influence of these sources on the composition of soil and dust. Although PM<inf>10</inf> has decreased over these years as a result of environmental measures undertaken in the city, some of the ""industrial"" elements still remain in concentrations of concern for example, up to 4.6% and 0.5% of Zn in dust and soil, respectively. Spatial trends in metals such as Zn and Cd clearly reflect sources from the processing industries. The concentrations of these elements across Europe have reduced over time, however the most recent results from Avilés revealed an upward trend in concentration for Zn, Cd, Hg and As. A risk assessment of the soil highlighted As as an element of concern since its cancer risk in adults was more than double the value above which regulatory agencies deem it to be unacceptable. If children were considered to be the receptors, then the risk nearly doubles from this element. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Metals; Risk assessment; Street dust; Urban geochemistry; Urban soil","Alloway, B.J., (1990) Heavy Metals in Soils, , Blackie, London; Anju, M., Banerjee, D.K., Associations of cadmium, zinc, and lead in soils from a lead and zinc mining area as studied by single and sequential extractions (2011) Environ.

Air samples were taken from standing breathing zone of employees, ~150cm above the ground level, and were analyzed using GC-FID. In each case, the types of smoked tobacco (regular, fruit flavored), types of ventilation systems (natural/artificial), and the floor level at which the café was located were investigated. A high mean concentration of 4.96±2.63mg/m3 corresponding to long term exposure to benzene-related cancer risk of 4314×10-6 was estimated. The levels of the remaining compounds were lower than the national guideline limits, but their hazard quotients (HQ) for long term exposure to ethylbenzene (1.15) and xylene (17.32) exceeded the HQ unit value. Total hazard indices (HI) of 63.23 were obtained for non-cancer risks. Type of the smoked tobacco was the most important factor influencing BTEX concentrations in the cafés. BTEX concentrations in indoor ambient air of Ardabil waterpipe cafés were noticeably high, and therefore may pose important risks for human health on both short and long term exposures. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; Benzene; EST; Ghalyun; Risk assessment","Agaku, I.T., Filippidis, F.T., Vardavas, C.I., Odukoya, O.O., Awopegba, A.J., Ayo-Yusuf, O.A., Connolly, G.N., Poly-tobacco use among adults in 44 countries during 2008-2012: evidence for an integrative and comprehensive approach in tobacco control (2014) Drug Alcohol Depend., 139, pp. 60-70; Akl, E.A., Gaddam, S., Gunukula, S.K., Honeine, R., Jaoude, P.A., Irani, J., The effects of waterpipe tobacco smoking on health outcomes: a systematic review (2010) Int.

The clinical characteristics of the patients and meningiomas, the extent of surgical resection, and complications after treatment were retrospectively analyzed.Results Thirteen patients (46.4%) had disease recurrence or progression during follow up time. The median time to disease progression was 64 months. The extent of the surgical resection significantly impacted prognosis. Gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor improved progression free survival (PFS) compared to subtotal resection (STR, p = 0.011). An older patient age at diagnosis also resulted in a worse outcome (p = 0.024). An MIB-1 index <8% also contributed to improved PFS (p = 0.031). None of the patients that underwent GTR and received adjuvant radiotherapy had tumors recur during follow up. STR with adjuvant radiotherapy tended to result in better local tumor control than STR alone (p = 0.074). Three of 28 patients (10.7%) developed complications after microsurgery. The GTR group had a higher rate of complications than those with STR. There were no late adverse effects after adjuvant radiotherapy during follow up.Conclusion For patients with skull base atypical meningiomas, GTR is desirable for longer PFS, unless radical excision is expected to lead to severe complications. Adjuvant radiation therapy is advisable to reduce tumor recurrence regardless of the extent of surgical resection. Age of disease onset and the MIB-1 index of the tumor were both independent prognostic factors of clinical outcome. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The authors aimed to characterize the clinical and treatment details of this poorly defined entity.Materials and methods A computerized systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, Google Scholar, Science Direct and Scopus. Keywords used were as follows: ""aneurysm""; ""myxoma""; ""choriocarcinoma""; ""oncotic aneurysm""; ""neoplastic aneurysm"". Only reports with cerebral aneurysm resulting from metastatic tumor and contained adequate clinical information pertinent to the analysis were included. Clinical and treatment characteristics were analyzed.Results Ninety-two studies reporting 96 cases of neoplastic cerebral aneurysm were identified. NCA from cardiac myxoma accounted for 60.4%, while NCA from choriocarcinoma and other tumors accounted for 26.1% and 13.5%, respectively. The rates of intracranial hemorrhages were 19.6% in NCA from myxoma, 100% in NCA from choriocarcinoma, and 84.6% in NCA from other tumors. 75.9% of NCA from myxoma were managed conservatively, 92% of NCA from choriocarcinoma were treated by surgery and/or chemotherapy, and 69.2% of NCA from other tumors were treated by surgery with or without chemotherapy. The mortality rates were 11.4% in NCA from myxoma, 60.9% in NCA from choriocarcinoma, and 92.3% in NCA from other tumors. According to a multiple logistic regression model, ""pathology (P = 0.002)"" is significantly correlated with outcome.Conclusions Neoplastic cerebral aneurysms are usually complicated with cardiac myxoma, choriocarcinoma and lung carcinoma. NCA from cardiac myxoma were probably multiple and rarely associated with intracranial hemorrhage, while the majority of NCA from choriocarcinoma and other tumors were single and presented with intracranial hemorrhage. The prognosis is quite good in NCA from cardiac myxoma, while NCA from malignant tumors were associated with poor outcome. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Different reports have mentioned that the two isoforms of CLU; secretary (sCLU) and nuclear (nCLU) have opposite (paradoxical) roles in cancer development. sCLU provides pro-survival signal, whereas nCLU is involved in pro-apoptotic signaling. However, the molecular mechanism of CLU gene regulation is not clear as of yet. We hypothesize that CLU gene is regulated by DNA methylation and histone modifications and clusterin plays an important role in colon cancer. To evaluate the hypothesis, we investigated CLU expression in colon cancer tissues and DNA methylation and histone modification status of CLU gene promoter. It is apparent from immonohistology data that both benign and cancerous (primary and metastasis) formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples exhibit CLU expression. However and interestingly only noncancerous tissue samples show nCLU expression. Ectopic expression of nCLU either by epigenetic modulators or by nCLU transfection is responsible for colon cancer cell death. To clarify the molecular mechanisms for regulation of expression of CLU isoforms, we have analyzed DNA methylation and histone modifications, such as histone H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and H3K9AcS10P patterns around the CLU promoter. There is no remarkable change in the DNA methylation status upon treatment of the cells by AZA, TSA and SAM. Our findings clearly show that promoter histone H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 marks are elevated in comparison to H3K4me3 and H3K9AcS10P marks in colon cancer cell lines. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Clusterin; Colon cancer; DNA methylation; Histone Modifications","Shannan, B., Seifert, M., Leskov, K., Willis, J., Boothman, D., Tilgen, W., Reichrath, J., Challenge and promise: roles for clusterin in pathogenesis, progression and therapy of cancer (2006) Cell Death Differ., 13, pp. 12-19; Trougakos, I.P., Gonos, E.S., Clusterin/apolipoprotein J in human aging and cancer (2002) Int.

There have been few studies reported concerning the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel-conjugated polymeric micelles in breast cancer in vivo. Methods Two kinds of PTX conjugate micelles, one of which (M(PTX)) contained 25 wt.% of PTX and the other (M(FA/PTX)) contained 22.5 wt.% of PTX and 1.4 wt.% of folate (FA), were prepared for cell apoptosis and anti-tumor activity evaluation on EMT-6 mice breast cancer models in comparison with 0.9 wt.% saline (control) and equivalent PTX. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. Breast tumors were examined histologically with H&E staining and immunohistochemically by examining Bax and Bcl-2 expression. The survival status of tumor-bearing mice with different treatments was also examined. Results On day 5 of the drug administration, the average tumor masses were 0.49, 0.33, 0.22, and 0.18 g for the control, PTX, M(PTX) and M(FA/PTX) groups, respectively. The inhibition rates of tumor growth calculated for the three drug groups were 32.6%, 51.6% and 62.3%, respectively. The percentage of cell apoptosis based on flow cytometry was 1.0%, 36.6%, 55.9% and 66.1%, respectively, which showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between three drug groups and the control group. Bcl-2 expression of PTX and M(FA/PTX) groups was lower than control group (p < 0.05). Bax expression of drug groups was higher than control group (p < 0.05). At an equivalent paclitaxel dose of 26.7 mg/kg, the average survival time was 33 days, 31 days, 34 days and 42 days, respectively (p < 0.05). Conclusion The M(FA/PTX) have better anti-tumor activity and are promising in treatment of human breast cancers. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

More specifically, several recent works have reported the successful QCM-mediated acoustic profiling of various biophysical transformations of cancerous cells (cancer cell profiling). Such a cancer cell acoustic profiling is aimed at characterizing adsorption, adhesion, spreading, and the homeostatic processes of initially suspended cancer cells, seeded onto various chemically engineered nanostructured QCM sensors. The nanostructuration of sensing the QCM electrode surfaces, with well-defined ligand compositions, provides a unique tool for deeply featuring the physico-chemical interaction basis of multi-parameter bio-molecular recognition events. Even individual recognition ones can be tracked to precisely probe the functional behavior of tested cellular systems. In this regard, the well-recognized 2D organization of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), of alkane-thiolates/disulfides, onto the bare surfaces of metals, such as gold, generates model chemically defined and structured organic surfaces, for cell interaction, when possessing specific ligands, enabling cell attachment and/or interaction. Herein, and in contrast to the most common suspended cell formats, the real-time in situ sensing, and biochemical profiling, of live raw non-processed cell line monolayers (cell monolayer formats) has been demonstrated to be felicitous. This bio-recognition event used a well-defined chemical composition of a cyclic disulfide-based SAM functional layer for QCM electrode nanostructuration/functionalization. This cyclic disulfide-based functional layer also has been shown to provide a robust sensing platform, quite well adapted to the non-planar nature of tested cancer cell monolayers, in a buffered aqueous environment. Corresponding bio-recognition events, for real-time in situ sensing and profiling, of non-suspended cell monolayers, enabled a significant reduction of the signal processing time, while keeping the interacting cells in their native state. As a matter of consequence, this new QCM-relating development may be considered as a significant step milestone, en-route to multiplexed in/ex vivo real-time diagnostics of tissue pathologies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Acoustic profiling of living cancer cell monolayers; diagnostic; QCM sensing electrode; Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM); Real time bio-molecular recognition; SAM nano-structured","Sauerbrey, G., (1959) Z.

One such master regulator, the redox sensitive transcription factor NF E2 Related Factor 2 (NRF2), controls the expression of cellular defense genes including those encoding intracellular redox-balancing proteins involved in glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Under basal conditions, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) targets NRF2 for ubiquitination. In response to oxidative stress, NRF2 dissociates from KEAP1, entering the nucleus and binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter of its target genes. Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production may deplete GSH levels within cancer cells. System xc -, an antiporter that exports glutamate while importing cystine to be converted into cysteine for GSH synthesis, is upregulated in cancer cells in response to oxidative stress. Here, we provided evidence that the expression of xCT, the light chain subunit of system xc -, is regulated by NRF2 in representative human breast cancer cells. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment increased nuclear translocation of NRF2, also increasing levels of xCT mRNA and protein and extracellular glutamate release. Overexpression of NRF2 up-regulated the activity of the xCT promoter, which contains a proximal ARE. In contrast, overexpression of KEAP1 repressed promoter activity and decreased xCT protein levels, while siRNA knockdown of KEAP1 up-regulated xCT protein levels and transporter activity. These results demonstrate the importance of the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway in balancing oxidative stress in breast cancer cells through system xc -. We have previously shown that xCT is upregulated in various cancer cell lines under oxidative stress. In the current investigation, we focused on MCF-7 cells as a model for mechanistic studies. © 2015 The Authors.","Hydrogen peroxide; KEAP1; NRF2; Oxidative stress; System xc -; XCT","Balendiran, G.K., Dabur, R., Fraser, D., The role of glutathione in cancer (2004) Cell Biochemistry and Function, 22, pp. 343-352; Bannai, S., Induction of cystine and glutamate transport activity in human fibroblasts by diethyl maleate and other electrophilic agents (1984) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 259, pp. 2435-2440; Watanabe, H., Bannai, S., Induction of cystine transport activity in mouse peritoneal macrophages (1987) Journal Experimental Medicine, 165, pp. 628-640; Sasaki, H., Sato, H., Kuriyama-Matsumura, K., Sato, K., Maebara, K., Wang, H., Tamba, M., Bannai, S., Electrophile response element-mediated induction of the cystine/glutamate exchange transporter gene expression (2002) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 277, pp. 44765-44771; Yang, Y., Yee, D., IGF-I regulates redox status in breast cancer cells by activating the amino acid transport molecule xC (2014) Cancer Research, 74, pp. 2295-2305; Lewerenz, J., Maher, P., Methner, A., Regulation of xCT expression and system x (c) (-) function in neuronal cells (2012) Amino Acids, 42 (1), pp. 171-179; Ungard, R.G., Seidlitz, E.P., Singh, G., Inhibition of breast cancer-cell glutamate release with sulfasalazine limits cancer-induced bone pain (2014) Pain, 155, pp. 28-36; Kim, J.Y., Kanai, Y., Chairoungdua, A., Cha, S.H., Matsuo, H., Kim, D.K., Inatomi, J., Endou, H., Human cystine/glutamate transporter: cDNA cloning and upregulation by oxidative stress in glioma cells (2001) Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1512, pp. 335-344; Sato, H., Tamba, M., Ishii, T., Bannai, S., Cloning and expression of a plasma membrane cystine/glutamate exchange transporter composed of two distinct proteins (1999) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 274 (17), pp. 11455-11458. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10206947; Lewerenz, J., Klein, M., Methner, A., Cooperative action of glutamate transporters and cystine/glutamate antiporter system Xc- protects from oxidative glutamate toxicity (2006) Journal of Neurochemistry, 98, pp. 916-925; Sharma, M.K., Seidlitz, E.P., Singh, G., Cancer cells release glutamate via the cystine/glutamate antiporter (2010) Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 391, pp. 91-95; Sato, H., Tamba, M., Kuriyama-Matsumura, K., Okuno, S., Bannai, S., Molecular cloning and expression of human xCT, the light chain of amino acid transport system xc (2000) Antioxidants and Redox Signaling, 2, pp. 665-671; Patel, S.A., Warren, B.A., Rhoderick, J.F., Bridges, R.J., Differentiation of substrate and non-substrate inhibitors of transport system xc(-): an obligate exchanger of l-glutamate and l-cystine (2004) Neuropharmacology, 46, pp. 273-284; Shiozaki, A., Iitaka, D., Ichikawa, D., Nakashima, S., Fujiwara, H., Okamoto, K., Kubota, T., Otsuji, E., XCT, component of cysteine/glutamate transporter, as an independent prognostic factor in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (2014) Journal of Gastroenterology, 49, pp. 853-863; Verschoor, M.L., Singh, G., Ets-1 regulates intracellular glutathione levels: key target for resistant ovarian cancer (2013) Mol.

In addition to this primary mechanism-of-action (MOA), OI based on vaccinia have been shown to selectively target tumor-associated vasculature, triggering an acute reduction in tumor perfusion. This review focuses on a third complementary MOA for this product class: the induction of active immunotherapy. While the active immunotherapy approach has been validated by recent product approvals, the field is still faced with significant challenges. Tumors have evolved diverse mechanisms to hide from immune-mediated destruction. Here we hypothesize that oncolytic immunotherapy replication within tumors may tip the immune balance to allow for the effective induction and execution of adaptive anti-tumor immunity, resulting in long-term tumor control following OI clearance. This immune activation against the cancer can be augmented through OI 'arming' for the expression of immunostimulatory transgene products from the virus genome. With the first vaccinia OI (Pexa-Vec, thymidine kinase-inactivated vaccinia expressing Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) now in advanced-stage clinical trials, it has become more important than ever to understand the complimentary MOA that contributes to tumor destruction and control in patients. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The present study investigated their occurrence and composition in plastic film greenhouse soil-vegetable systems and assessed their potential health risks to farmers exposed to these widespread pollutants. Six priority control phthalates, namely dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP), were determined in 44 plastic film greenhouse vegetables and corresponding soils. Total PAEs ranged from 0.51 to 7.16mgkg-1 in vegetables and 0.40 to 6.20mgkg-1 in soils with average concentrations of 2.56 and 2.23mgkg-1, respectively. DnBP, DEHP and DnOP contributed more than 90% of the total PAEs in both vegetables and soils but the proportions of DnBP and DnOP in vegetables were significantly (p<0.05) higher than in soils. The average concentrations of PAEs in pot herb mustard, celery and lettuce were >3.00mgkg-1 but were <2.50mgkg-1 in the corresponding soils. Stem and leaf vegetables accumulated more PAEs. There were no clear relationships between vegetable and soil PAEs. Risk assessment indicates that DnBP, DEHP and DnOP exhibited elevated non-cancer risk with values of 0.039, 0.338 and 0.038, respectively. The carcinogenic risk of DEHP was about 3.94×10-5 to farmers working in plastic film greenhouses. Health risks were mainly by exposure through vegetable consumption and soil ingestion. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Greenhouse soils; Phthalates; Plastic film; Risk assessment; Vegetables","Bell, F.P., Effects of phthalate esters on lipid metabolism in various tissues, cells and organelles in mammals (1982) Environ.

For example, H3K36me3 and H3K9Ac that are common in highly expressed cellular genes and over exons, were more common in the early than in the late region of the HPV16 genome. In contrast, H3K9me3, H4K20me3, H2BK5me1 and H4K16Ac were more frequent in the HPV16 late region. Furthermore, a region encompassing the HPV16 early polyadenylation signal pAE displayed high levels of histone H3 acetylation. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors caused a 2- to 8-fold induction of HPV16 early and late mRNAs in cervical cancer cells and in immortalized keratinocytes, while at the same time increasing the levels of acetylated histones in the cells and on the HPV16 genome specifically. We concluded that increased histone acetylation on the HPV16 genome correlates with increased HPV16 gene expression. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Epigenetics; H2BK5me1; H3K36me3; H3K9Ac; H3K9me3; H4K20me3; HDAC inhibitor; Histone marks; Hnrnp; HPV16; Panobinostat; Papillomavirus; Polyadenylation; Quisinostat; Splicing; SR proteins","Acuna, L.I.G., Fiszbein, A., Alló, M., Schor, I.E., Kornblihtt, A.R., Connections between chromatin signatures and splicing (2013) WIREs RNA, 4, pp. 77-91; Andersson, R., Enroth, S., Rada-Iglesias, A., Wadelius, C., Komorowski, J., Nucleosomes are well positioned in exons and carry characteristic histone modifications (2009) Genome Res., 19, pp. 1732-1741; Arts, J., King, P., Marien, A., Floren, W., Belien, A., JNJ-26481585, a novel second-generation oral histone deacetylase inhibitor, shows broad-spectrum preclinical antitumoral activity (2009) Clin.

Many chromatin modifying-enzymes utilize metabolic intermediates as cofactors or substrates, and recent studies have demonstrated that the epigenome is sensitive to cellular metabolism. The contribution of metabolic alterations to epigenetic deregulation in cancer cells is just beginning to emerge, as are the roles of the metabolism-epigenetics link in tumorigenesis. Here we review the roles of acetyl-CoA and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), donor substrates for acetylation and methylation reactions, respectively, in regulating chromatin modifications in response to nutrient metabolism. We further discuss how oncogenic signaling, cell metabolism, and histone modifications are interconnected and how their relationship might impact tumor growth. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Hardie, D.G., Ross, F.A., Hawley, S.A., AMPK: a nutrient and energy sensor that maintains energy homeostasis (2012) Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol, 13, pp. 251-262; Laplante, M., Sabatini, D.M., MTOR signaling in growth control and disease (2012) Cell, 149, pp. 274-293; Metallo, C.M., Vander Heiden, M.G., Metabolism strikes back: metabolic flux regulates cell signaling (2010) Genes Dev, 24, pp. 2717-2722; Wellen, K.E., Thompson, C.B., A two-way street: reciprocal regulation of metabolism and signalling (2012) Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol, 13, pp. 270-276; Lu, C., Thompson, C.B., Metabolic regulation of epigenetics (2012) Cell Metab, 16, pp. 9-17; Ward, P.S., Thompson, C.B., Metabolic reprogramming: a cancer hallmark even warburg did not anticipate (2012) Cancer Cell, 21, pp. 297-308; Kaelin, W.G., McKnight, S.L., Influence of metabolism on epigenetics and disease (2013) Cell, 153, pp. 56-69; Kaochar, S., Tu, B.P., Gatekeepers of chromatin: small metabolites elicit big changes in gene expression (2012) Trends Biochem Sci, 37, pp. 477-483; Shen, H., Laird, P.W., Interplay between the cancer genome and epigenome (2013) Cell, 153, pp. 38-55; Suva, M.L., Riggi, N., Bernstein, B.E., Epigenetic reprogramming in cancer (2013) Science, 339, pp. 1567-1570; Cairns, R.A., Mak, T.W., Oncogenic isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations: mechanisms, models, and clinical opportunities (2013) Cancer Discov, 3, pp. 730-741; Losman, J.A., Kaelin, W.G., What a difference a hydroxyl makes: mutant IDH, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, and cancer (2013) Genes Dev, 27, pp. 836-852; Roth, S.Y., Denu, J.M., Allis, C.D., Histone acetyltransferases (2001) Annu Rev Biochem, 70, pp. 81-120; Lee, J.V., Carrer, A., Shah, S., Snyder, N.W., Wei, S., Venneti, S., Worth, A.J., Jackson, E., AKT-dependent metabolic reprogramming regulates tumor cell histone acetylation (2014) Cell Metab, 20, pp. 306-319; Marino, G., Pietrocola, F., Eisenberg, T., Kong, Y., Malik, S.A., Andryushkova, A., Schroeder, S., Zamzami, N., Regulation of autophagy by cytosolic acetyl-coenzyme A (2014) Mol Cell, 53, pp. 710-725; Sahar, S., Masubuchi, S., Eckel-Mahan, K., Vollmer, S., Galla, L., Ceglia, N., Masri, S., Astarita, G., Circadian control of fatty acid elongation by SIRT1 protein-mediated deacetylation of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase 1 (2014) J Biol Chem, 289, pp. 6091-6097; Cai, L., Sutter, B.M., Li, B., Tu, B.P., Acetyl-CoA induces cell growth and proliferation by promoting the acetylation of histones at growth genes (2011) Mol Cell, 42, pp. 426-437; Friis, R.M., Wu, B.P., Reinke, S.N., Hockman, D.J., Sykes, B.D., Schultz, M.C., A glycolytic burst drives glucose induction of global histone acetylation by picNuA4 and SAGA (2009) Nucleic Acids Res, 37, pp. 3969-3980; Langer, M.R., Fry, C.J., Peterson, C.L., Denu, J.M., Modulating acetyl-CoA binding in the Gcn5 family of histone acetyltransferases (2002) J Biol Chem, 277, pp. 27337-27344; Albaugh, B.N., Arnold, K.M., Denu, J.M., Kat(ching) metabolism by the tail: insight into the links between lysine acetyltransferases and metabolism (2011) ChemBioChem, 12, pp. 290-298; Evertts, A.G., Zee, B.M., Dimaggio, P.A., Gonzales-Cope, M., Coller, H.A., Garcia, B.A., Quantitative dynamics of the link between cellular metabolism and histone acetylation (2013) J Biol Chem, 288, pp. 12142-12151; Waterborg, J.H., Dynamics of histone acetylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2001) Biochemistry, 40, pp. 2599-2605; Sutendra, G., Kinnaird, A., Dromparis, P., Paulin, R., Stenson, T.H., Haromy, A., Hashimoto, K., Michelakis, E.D., A nuclear pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is important for the generation of acetyl-CoA and histone acetylation (2014) Cell, 158, pp. 84-97; Wellen, K.E., Hatzivassiliou, G., Sachdeva, U.M., Bui, T.V., Cross, J.R., Thompson, C.B., ATP-citrate lyase links cellular metabolism to histone acetylation (2009) Science, 324, pp. 1076-1080; Takahashi, H., McCaffery, J.M., Irizarry, R.A., Boeke, J.D., Nucleocytosolic acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase is required for histone acetylation and global transcription (2006) Mol Cell, 23, pp. 207-217; Fan, J., Kamphorst, J.J., Mathew, R., Chung, M.K., White, E., Shlomi, T., Rabinowitz, J.D., Glutamine-driven oxidative phosphorylation is a major ATP source in transformed mammalian cells in both normoxia and hypoxia (2013) Mol Syst Biol, 9, p. 712; Berwick, D.C., Hers, I., Heesom, K.J., Moule, S.K., Tavare, J.M., The identification of ATP-citrate lyase as a protein kinase B (AKT) substrate in primary adipocytes (2002) J Biol Chem, 277, pp. 33895-33900; Potapova, I.A., El-Maghrabi, M.R., Doronin, S.V., Benjamin, W.B., Phosphorylation of recombinant human ATP:citrate lyase by camp-dependent protein kinase abolishes homotropic allosteric regulation of the enzyme by citrate and increases the enzyme activity.

Moreover, the natural tropism of oncolytic adenoviruses can be redirected to tumor cells. Clinical trials revealed that oncolytic viruses showed poor replication in the tumor that is due in part to the immune response against the virus. More recent data demonstrated that tumor infection might subvert the tumor immune system and lead to an anti-tumor immune response.

Two kinds of antibodies were used to recognize CEA at different epitopes with high affinity and specificity. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) modified with streptavidin (SA) were used to further enhance signal specifically via biotin-streptavidin interaction. The binding capacity of the streptavidin-modified gold nanoparticles (SA-GNPs) for ligand biotin was quantified by titration with biotin (5-fluorescein) conjugate to be 10.54 biotin binding sites per 100 nm2. The developed GNPs enhanced sandwich SPR biosensor successfully fulfilled the sensitive detection of CEA in the range of 1-60 ng/mL with a detection limit of 1.0 ng/mL. Compared to the direct assay format, sandwich format without GNPs and SA-GNPs enhanced sandwich format led to 4.2-fold and 13.8-fold in the sensitivity, respectively. This sensor also showed good selectivity for CEA in the interference study. The results demonstrated that the proposed method could provide a high sensitivity and selectivity in the detection of CEA and offer a promising alternative for cancer biomarker than traditional clinical examinations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the presence of oxygen, normal metabolism generates reactive species (ROS) that have the potential to cause cell injury contributing to human aging and disease. Between these extremes, organisms have developed means for sensing oxygen and ROS and regulating their cellular processes in response. Redox signaling contributes to the control of cell proliferation and death. Aberrant redox signaling underlies many human diseases. The attributes acquired by altered redox homeostasis in cancer cells illustrate this particularly well. This teaching review and the accompanying illustrations provide an introduction to redox biology and signaling aimed at instructors of graduate and medical students. © 2015 The Authors.","Apoptosis; Cancer;

They are attractive avenues of cancer therapy due to the absence of toxic side effects often seen in current treatment modalities. Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) holds promise as a broad-spectrum oncolytic vector that is able to infect and kill human tumor cells from a variety of histological origins, including cancer-initiating cells. In the majority of cases, BHV-1 elicits tumor cell death in the absence of a productive infection. In vivo, BHV-1 affects the incidence of secondary lesions in cotton rats bearing subcutaneous breast adenocarcinomas.

Here we report a simple and low cost biosensor based on Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) taking advantage of a plastic optical fiber (POF) for the detection of Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), selected as a circulating protein potentially associated with cancer. Our system is based onto two crucial aspects. By one hand, the functional layer which allows the transduction signal is based on DNA aptamers, short oligonucleotide sequences that bind to non-nucleic acid targets with high affinity and specificity. By the other hand, the light guiding structure is based on a POF with a planar gold layer as the sensing region, which is particularly suitable for bioreceptors implementation. The sensor revealed to be really useful in the interface characterization. The developed system is relatively easy to realize and could well address the development of a rapid, portable and low cost diagnostic platform, with a sensitivity in the nanomolar range. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We used a 2nd-generation (iTRAQ-8plex) proteomic approach to identify/quantify proteins differentially expressed in the liver of free-living Mus spretus mice from Doñana National Park or its proximities. Mass spectrometry was performed in an LTQ Orbitrap system for iTRAQ reporter ion quantitation and protein identification using a Mus musculus database as reference. A prior IEF step improved the separation of the complex peptide mixture. Over 2000 identified proteins were altered, of which 118 changed by ≥. 2.5-fold in mice from at least two problem sites. Part of the results obtained with the iTRAQ analysis was confirmed by Western blot. Over 75% of the 118 proteins were upregulated in animals captured at polluted sites and only 16 proteins were downregulated. Upregulated proteins were involved in stress response; cell proliferation and apoptosis; signal transduction; metastasis or tumour suppression; xenobiotic export or vesicular trafficking; and metabolism. The downregulated proteins, all potentially harmful, were classified as oncoproteins and proteins favouring genome instability. The iTRAQ results presented here demonstrated that the survival of hepatic cells is compromised in animals living at polluted sites, which showed deep alterations in metabolism and the signalling pathways. The identified proteins may be useful as biomarkers of environmental pollution and provide insight about the metabolic pathways and/or physiological processes affected by pollutants in DNP and its surrounding areas. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cell proliferation/apoptosis; Doñana surroundings; Environmental pollution; Mus spretus; Second-generation proteomics; Stress response","Abril, N., Ruiz-Laguna, J., Osuna-Jimenez, I., Vioque-Fernandez, A., Fernandez-Cisnal, R., Chicano-Galvez, E., Omic approaches in environmental issues (2011) J.

Electrochemical therapy (EChT) is attractive, as it relies on locally-induced reduction-oxidation reactions to kill tumor cells. Its efficacy for prostate cancer was assessed in human PC-3 and LNCaP tumor xenografts growing subcutaneously in nude mice (n=80) by applying 2 Stainless Steel vs. 4 Platinum-Iridium (Pt-Ir) electrodes to deliver current densities of 10 to 35mA/cm2 for 30 or 60min. The procedure was uneventful in 90% of mice. No difference in tumor vs. body temperature was observed. Changes at electrode-tumor junctions were immediate, with dryness and acidity (pH2-3) at the anode and oedema and alkalinity (pH10-12) at the cathode. This was accompanied by cellular alterations, found more pronounced at the cathode. Such acidic and alkaline conditions were cytotoxic in vitro and dissolved cells at pH&gt;10. In mice, tumor destruction was extensive by 24h with almost undetectable blood prostate specific antigen (LNCaP model) and covered the whole tumor surface by 4days. EChT was most efficient at 25-30mA/cm2 for 60min, yielding the longest recurrence-free survival and higher cure rates, especially with 4 Pt-Ir electrodes. EChT is a promising option to optimize for organ-confined prostate tumors. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Electrochemical redox therapy; Minimally invasive therapy; Prostate cancer; Prostate tumors; Tissue destruction; Tumor electrolysis","Sanda, M.G., Dunn, R.L., Michalski, J., Sandler, H.M., Northouse, L., Hembroff, L., Lin, X., Wei, J.T., Quality of life and satisfaction with outcome among prostate-cancer survivors (2008) N.

TRP channels respond to a variety of stimuli, including light, mechanical or chemical stimuli, temperature, pH or osmolarity. In addition, several TRP family members have been identified as downstream molecules in the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. TRP proteins are involved in a variety of cell functions both in non-excitable and excitable cells due to their diverse permeability to cations and their ability to modulate intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Emerging evidence suggests that TRP channel dysfunction significantly contributes to the physiopathology of a number of diseases, including cardiovascular, neurological, metabolic or neoplastic disorders. This review focuses on the implication of TRP proteins in the pathogenesis of some of the most prevalent disorders in human. We summarize the current findings regarding the role of TRP proteins in the development of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus as well as diabetic complications, and tumorigenesis and present TRP proteins as targets of potential diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer cells; Cardiovascular disorders; Diabetes mellitus; TRP channels; Tumorigenesis","Montell, C., Rubin, G.M., Molecular characterization of the Drosophila trp locus: a putative integral membrane protein required for phototransduction (1989) Neuron, 2, pp. 1313-1323; Hardie, R.C., Minke, B., The trp gene is essential for a light-activated Ca2+ channel in Drosophila photoreceptors (1992) Neuron, 8, pp. 643-651; Montell, C., Physiology, phylogeny, and functions of the TRP superfamily of cation channels (2001) Sci.

Five tissue-equivalent and Rando phantoms were used to simulate lung cancer patients. This study then measured E and equivalent dose of organ or tissues (D<inf>T</inf>) using thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD-100H). The TLD-100H was calibrated using TOMO 6MV photons, then inserted into phantom positions that closely corresponded with the position of the represented organs and tissues. Both E and D<inf>T</inf> were evaluated by ICRP 103. Peripheral doses varied markedly at positions close to the tumor center. The maximum statistical and total errors were 16.7-22.3%. This analytical result indicates that E of Rando and tissue-equivalent phantoms was in the ranged of 9.44±1.70 (10kg) to 4.58±0.83 (90kg)mSv/Gy. Notably, E decreased exponentially as phantom weight increased. Peripheral doses were also evaluated by TLD as a function of distance from the tumor center. Finally, experimental results are compared with those in literature. These findings will prove useful to patients, physicians, radiologists, and the public. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Effective dose (E); Equivalent dose of organ or tissues (D<inf>T</inf>); Helical tomotherapy (TOMO); ICRP 103; Lung cancer; Peripheral dose; Tissue-equivalent phantom; TLD","Balog, J., Lucas, D., DeSouza, C., Crilly, R., Helical tomotherapy radiation leakage and shielding considerations (2005) Med.

Several reagents, including agonistic anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (anti-CD40), CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG) and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), can stimulate activation of macrophages. Our previous studies showed synergy between anti-CD40 and CpG and between anti-CD40 and MPL in macrophage activation and antitumor efficacy in mice. In the present study, we asked whether there was synergy among these three reagents. The activation of adherent peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) obtained from mice injected with anti-CD40 and then treated with CpG and/or MPL in vitro was determined by their ability to suppress proliferation of tumor cells and to produce various cytokines and chemokines in vitro. Cell sorting and histology followed by functional testing showed that macrophages were the main cell population in PEC activated by CD40 ligation in vivo. A combination of anti-CD40, CpG or MPL activated PEC to suppress proliferation of B16 cells and produce nitric oxide far greater than the single reagents or any of the double combinations of these reagents. In addition, the combination of all three reagents activated PEC to secrete IL-12, IFN-γ and MCP-1 to a greater degree than any single reagent or any two combined reagents. These results demonstrate that macrophages can be synergistically activated by anti-CD40, CpG and MPL, suggesting that this novel combined approach might be further investigated as potential cancer therapy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Anti-CD40; CpG; Immunotherapy; Macrophages; Monophosphoryl lipid A","Alderson, M.R., Armitage, R.J., Tough, T.W., Strockbine, L., Fanslow, W.C., Spriggs, M.K., CD40 expression by human monocytes: regulation by cytokines and activation of monocytes by the ligand for CD40 (1993) J.

While many human tumor cells, including conventional drug-resistant ones, can be killed by H-1PV, some fail to support progeny virus production, necessary for infection propagation in neoplastic tissues. This limitation can be overcome through forced selection of H-1PV variants capable of enhanced multiplication and spreading in human tumor cells. In the context of further developing H-1PV for use in cancer therapy, arming it with immunostimulatory CpG motifs under conditions preserving replication and oncolysis enhances its action as an anticancer vaccine adjuvant. A first clinical study of H-1PV treatment in glioma patients has yielded evidence of intratumoral synthesis of the viral oncotoxic protein NS1 and immune cell infiltration. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Due to their remarkable stability we have predominantly explored Mn porphyrins, aiming initially at mimicking kinetics and thermodynamics of the catalysis of O2 - dismutation by SOD enzymes. Several MnPs are of potency similar to SOD enzymes. The in vivo bioavailability and toxicity of MnPs have been addressed also. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies indicate their impressive therapeutic efficacy. Increasing insight into complex cellular redox biology has been accompanied by increasing awareness of complex redox chemistry of MnPs. During O2 - dismutation process, the most powerful Mn porphyrin-based SOD mimics reduce and oxidize O2 - with close to identical rate constants. MnPs reduce and oxidize other reactive species also (none of them specific to MnPs), acting as reductants (antioxidant) and pro-oxidants. Distinction must be made between the type of reactions of MnPs and the favorable therapeutic effects we observe; the latter may be of either anti- or pro-oxidative nature. H2O2/MnP mediated oxidation of protein thiols and its impact on cellular transcription seems to dominate redox biology of MnPs. It has been thus far demonstrated that the ability of MnPs to catalyze O2 - dismutation parallels all other reactivities (such as ONOO- reduction) and in turn their therapeutic efficacies. Assuming that all diseases have in common the perturbation of cellular redox environment, developing SOD mimics still seems to be the appropriate strategy for the design of potent redox-active therapeutics. © 2015 The Authors.","Fe porphyrin-based SOD mimics; Mechanism(s) of action(s) of Mn porphyrins; Mn-porphyrin-based non-SOD mimics; Mn-porphyrin-based SOD mimics; Reactivities of Mn porphyrins in aqueous solutions, cells and animals; Therapeutic effects","Abreu, I.A., Cabelli, D.E., Superoxide dismutases - a review of the metal-associated mechanistic variations (2010) Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1804 (2), pp. 263-274. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19914406; Holley, A.K., Miao, L., St Clair, D.K., St Clair, W.H., Redox-modulated phenomena and radiation therapy: the central role of superoxide dismutases (2014) Antioxidants and Redox Signaling, 20 (10), pp. 1567-1589. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24094070; Batinic-Haberle, I., Tovmasyan, A., Roberts, E.R., Vujaskovic, Z., Leong, K.W., Spasojevic, I., SOD therapeutics: latest insights into their structure-activity relationships and impact on the cellular redox-based signaling pathways (2014) Antioxidants and Redox Signaling, 20 (15), pp. 2372-2415. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23875805; Celic, T., Španjol, J., Bobinac, M., Tovmasyan, A., Vukelic, I., Reboucas, J.S., Batinic-Haberle, I., Bobinac, D., Mn porphyrin-based SOD mimic, MnTnHex-2-PyP(5+), and non-SOD mimic, MnTBAP(3-), suppressed rat spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury via NF-κB pathways (2014) Free Radical Research, 48, pp. 1426-1442. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25185063; Miriyala, S., Spasojevic, I., Tovmasyan, A., Salvemini, D., Vujaskovic, Z., St Clair, D., Batinic-Haberle, I., Manganese superoxide dismutase, MnSOD and its mimics (2012) Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1822 (5), pp. 794-814. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22198225; Tovmasyan, A., Carballal, S., Ghazaryan, R., Melikyan, L., Weitner, T., Maia, C.G., Reboucas, J.S., Batinic-Haberle, I., Rational design of superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimics: the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of New cationic Mn porphyrins with linear and cyclic substituents (2014) Inorganic Chemistry, 53 (21), pp. 11467-11483. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25333724; Ferrer-Sueta, G., Vitturi, D., Batinic-Haberle, I., Fridovich, I., Goldstein, S., Czapski, G., Radi, R., Reactions of manganese porphyrins with peroxynitrite and carbonate radical anion (2003) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 278 (30), pp. 27432-27438. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12700236; Eckshtain, M., Zilbermann, I., Mahammed, A., Saltsman, I., Okun, Z., Maimon, E., Cohen, H., Gross, Z., Superoxide dismutase activity of corrole metal complexes (2009) Dalton Transactions, (38), pp. 7879-7882. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19771348; Batinić-Haberle, I., Rebouças, J.S., Spasojević, I., Superoxide dismutase mimics: chemistry, pharmacology, and therapeutic potential (2010) Antioxidants and Redox Signaling, 13 (6), pp. 877-918. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20095865; Batinić-Haberle, I., Spasojević, I., Stevens, R.D., Hambright, P., Neta, P., Okado-Matsumoto, A., Fridovich, I., New class of potent catalysts of O2.-dismutation.

The anticancer mechanism of our complexes is documented from their enhanced DNA splitting personalities under physiological conditions. To reveal the chemotherapeutic action of these complexes, we explored the inflammatory response, analgesic and antioxidant activities. Moreover, all the complexes show good antimicrobial activity against few bacterial and fungal strains.

Existing assays for the measurement of soluble, activated complement proteins are based on the detection of conformational neoepitopes. We tested an alternative approach based on detection of short linear neoepitopes exposed at the cleavage sites after activation of the actual complement component.

Systemic inflammation has been hypothesized as a putative biological mechanism contributing to these adverse health effects. We evaluated the effect of long-term exposure to air pollution on blood markers of systemic inflammation.We measured a panel of 28 inflammatory markers in peripheral blood samples from 587 individuals that were biobanked as part of a prospective study. Participants were from Varese and Turin (Italy) and Umea (Sweden). Long-term air pollution estimates of nitrogen oxides (NO<inf>x</inf>) were available from the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE). Linear mixed models adjusted for potential confounders were applied to assess the association between NO<inf>x</inf> and the markers of inflammation.Long-term exposure to NO<inf>x</inf> was associated with decreased levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α in Italy, but not in Sweden. NO<inf>x</inf> exposure levels were considerably lower in Sweden than in Italy (Sweden: median (5th, 95th percentiles) 6.65μg/m3 (4.8, 19.7); Italy: median (5th, 95th percentiles) 94.2μg/m3 (7.8, 124.5)). Combining data from Italy and Sweden we only observed a significant association between long-term exposure to NO<inf>x</inf> and decreased levels of circulating IL-8.We observed some indication for perturbations in the inflammatory markers due to long-term exposure to NO<inf>x</inf>. Effects were stronger in Italy than in Sweden, potentially reflecting the difference in air pollution levels between the two cohorts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Air pollution; Chronic health effects; Gene expression; Inflammatory markers","Beelen, R., Hoek, G., Vienneau, D., Eeftens, M., Dimakopoulou, K., Pedeli, X., Development of NO<inf>2</inf> and NO<inf>x</inf> land use regression models for estimating air pollution exposure in 36 study areas in Europe - the ESCAPE project (2013) Atmos.

Targeted theranostic nanoplatforms have emerged globally as frontier research for the improvement of cancer therapy. Trastuzumab (Tmab), a humanized monoclonal antibody is now being used to target human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER 2) positive cancer cells. In the present study, we have analysed the imaging and theragnosis potentiality of Tmab functionalized lipid based nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with anticancer drug rapamycin and imaging agent (quantum dots) for targeted cancer therapy and imaging. The therapeutic evaluation of drug loaded NPs were evaluated through various in vitro cellular studies. The results showed enhanced therapeutic efficacy of targeted drug loaded NPs over native drug and unconjugated NPs in HER 2 positive SKBR 3 breast cancer cell line. Moreover, exploration of the therapeutic benefits of rapamycin loaded Tmab conjugated NPs (Tmab-rapa-NPs) at molecular level, revealed augmented down regulation of mTOR signalling pathway thereby, inducing more cell death. Above all, our targeted multifunctional NPs have shown an excellent bio-imaging modality both in 2D monolayer and 3D tumor spheroid model. Thus, we can anticipate that such a multimodal nanotheranostic approach may be a useful tool for better cancer management in future. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Nanoparticles; Nanotheranostics; Quantum dots; Rapamycin; Trastuzumab","Parveen, S., Sahoo, S.K., (2008) J.

Polarized status of drug transporters, i.e., their coordinated location at sinusoidal or canalicular membranes, remains however incompletely documented in these cultured hepatocytes. The present study was therefore designed to analyze transporter expression and location in such cells. Most of drug transporters were first shown to be present at notable mRNA levels in monolayer-cultured human hepatocytes. Cultured human hepatocytes, which morphologically exhibited bile canaliculi-like structures, were next demonstrated, through immunofluorescence staining, to express the influx transporters organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, OATP2B1 and organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 and the efflux transporter multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 3 at their sinusoidal pole. In addition, the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein and MRP2 were detected at the canalicular pole of monolayer-cultured human hepatocytes. Moreover, canalicular secretion of reference substrates for the efflux transporters bile salt export pump, MRP2 and P-glycoprotein as well as sinusoidal drug transporter activities were observed. This polarized and functional expression of drug transporters in monolayer-cultured human hepatocytes highlights the interest of using this human in vitro cell model in xenobiotic transport studies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Canalicular secretion; Drug transporter; Hepatocytes; Polarization; Primary culture","Annaert, P.P., Turncliff, R.Z., Booth, C.L., Thakker, D.R., Brouwer, K.L., P-glycoprotein-mediated in vitro biliary excretion in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes (2001) Drug Metab.

In this study, resveratrol- and 5-fluorouracil-loaded ultradeformable liposomes were investigated for the potential treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer. The in vitro anticancer activity of ultradeformable liposomes was tested on human skin cancer cells through viability-, cell cycle- and apoptosis-analysis. Furthermore, we tested the percutaneous permeation of ultradeformable liposomes using human stratum corneum and viable epidermis. The co-encapsulation of resveratrol and 5-fluorouracil (multi-drug carrier) in ultradeformable liposomes improved their anticancer activity on skin cancer cells as compared to both the free drug form and the single entrapped agents. These multi-drug ultradeformable liposomes arrest cell proliferation in G<inf>1</inf>/S, thus modifying the action of 5-fluorouracil and increasing the activity of resveratrol. This effect might depend on the ultradeformable liposomes, which may accumulate in deeper skin layers, thus generating a cutaneous depot from which resveratrol and 5-fluorouracil are gradually released. Resveratrol and 5-fluorouracil co-loaded ultradeformable liposomes could be a new nanomedicine for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma, i.e., actinic keratosis, Bowen's disease, and keratoacanthoma. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Multi-drug colloidal carriers; Skin cancer; Skin delivery; Supramolecular therapeutics; Ultradeformable liposomes","Ainbinder, D., Paolino, D., Fresta, M., Touitou, E., Drug delivery applications with ethosomes (2010) J.

In the present study, we have developed a novel composite PLGA NP co-encapsulated with anticancer drug (sorafenib) and magnetic NP (SPION). We have successfully developed nanosized folate-conjugated PEGylated PLGA nanoparticles (SRF/FA-PEG-PLGA NP) with both anticancer and magnetic resonance property. We have showed that FA-conjugated NP exhibits sustained drug release and enhanced cellular uptake in BEL7402 cancer cells. The targeted NP effectively suppressed the tumor cell proliferation and has improved the anticancer efficacy than that of free drug or non-targeted one. Additionally, enhanced MRI properties demonstrate this formulation has good imaging agent characteristics. Finally, SRF/FA-PEG-PLGA NP effectively inhibited the colony forming ability indicating its superior anticancer effect. Together, these multifunctional nanoparticles would be most ideal to improve the therapeutic response in cancer and holds great potential to be a part of future nanomedicine. Our unique approach could be extended for multiple biomedical applications. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Liver cancer; Magnetic nanoparticles; Magnetic resonance imaging; Nanomedicine; PLGA; Sorafenib","Bjornerud, A., Johansson, L., The utility of superparamagnetic contrast agents in MRI: theoretical consideration and applications in the cardiovascular system (2004) NMR Biomed., 17, pp. 465-477; Caraglia, M., Giuberti, G., Marra, M., Oxidative stress and ERK1/2 phosphorylation as predictors of outcome in hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with sorafenib plus octreotide LAR (2011) Cell Death Dis., 2, p. 150; Chen, W., Xu, N., Xu, L., Multifunctional magnetoplasmonic nanoparticle assemblies for cancer therapy and diagnostics (theranostics) (2010) Macromol.

Therefore, collagen is a highly promising target for cancer therapy. The collagen-binding domain (CBD) can dynamically bind to collagen and achieve the sustained release of CBD-fused protein in the collagen network. Here, we developed a collagen-binding epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody fragment for targeting the collagen-rich ECM in tumors. The single chain fragment variable (scFv) of cetuximab was fused to CBD (CBD-scFv) and expressed in Pichia pastoris. CBD-scFv preserved the antigen binding domain and anti-tumor activity of cetuximab in vitro. Moreover, CBD-scFv displayed a collagen binding ability due to the function of CBD. In vivo experiments revealed that CBD-scFv bound to collagen and achieved sustained release in tumors. Furthermore, CBD-scFv significantly suppressed the growth of tumors in A431 xenografts. Therefore, CBD-scFv had a potential therapeutic value for the collagen-rich carcinomas. The specific target and sustained release of CBD-scFv in tumors could be a new approach for targeted drug delivery in cancer therapy. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","A431 xenograft; CBD-scFv; Collagen; Collagen-binding domain; Controlled release","Egeblad, M., Rasch, M.G., Weaver, V.M., Dynamic interplay between the collagen scaffold and tumor evolution (2010) Curr.

Polymeric-based targeted particulate carrier system has shown to directly deliver the encapsulated anti-cancer drug to the desired site of action and prevent the interaction of encapsulated drug with the normal cells. Pluronic F127 (PF127) has been widely investigated for its broad-range of therodiagnostic applications in biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences, but rapid dissolution in the physiological fluids, short residence time, rapid clearance, and weak mechanical strength are the main shortcomings that are associated with PF127 and have recently been overcome by making various modifications in the structure of PF127 notably through preparation of PF127-based mixed polymeric micelles, PF127-conjugated nanoparticles and PF127-based hydrophobically modified thermogels. In this article, we have briefly discussed the recent studies that have been conducted on various anti-cancer drugs using PF127 as nano-carrier modified with other copolymers and/or conjugated with magnetic nanoparticles. The key findings of these studies demonstrated that the modified form of PF127 can significantly increase the stability of incorporated hydrophobic drugs with enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of anti-cancer drugs. Moreover, the modified form of PF127 has also shown its therapeutic potentials as therodiagnostics in various types of tumors and cancers. Hence, it can be concluded that the modified form of PF127 exhibits significant therodiagnostic effects with increased tumor-specific delivery of anti-cancer drugs having minimal toxic effects as compared to PF127 alone and/or other copolymers. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about how to specifically capture and deactivate CTCs in vivo, which may lead to successful metastasis prevention in asymptomatic cancer survivors after surgery. We hypothesize that the dual antibody conjugates may have the advantage of capturing CTCs specifically over their single antibody counterparts. Here we show that the surface-functionalized dendrimers can be sequentially coated with two antibodies directed to surface biomarkers (EpCAM and Slex) of human colorectal CTCs. The dual antibody-coated dendrimers exhibit a significantly enhanced specificity in capturing CTCs in the presence of interfering blood cells, and in both eight-patient bloods and nude mice administered with the labeled CTCs in comparison to their single antibody-coated counterparts. The dual antibody-coated conjugates down-regulate the captured CTCs. This study provides the first conceptual evidence that two antibodies can be biocompatibly conjugated to a nanomaterial to capture and down-regulate CTCs in vivo with the enhanced specificity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

For selective cancer cell targeting, here the coupling of a synthetic cytolysin to the hY<inf>1</inf>-receptor preferring peptide [F7,P34]-neuropeptide Y (NPY) using a labile disulfide linker is described. Since hY<inf>1</inf>-receptors are overexpressed in breast tumors and internalize rapidly, this system has high potential as peptide-drug shuttle system. Molecular characterization of the cytolysin-[F7,P34]-NPY bioconjugate revealed potent receptor activation and receptor-selective internalization, while viability studies verified toxicity. Triple SILAC studies comparing free cytolysin with the bioconjugate demonstrated an intracellular mechanism of action regardless of the delivery pathway. Treatments resulted in a regulation of proteins implemented in cell cycle arrest confirming the tubulysin-like effect of the cytolysin. Thus, the cytolysin-peptide bioconjugate fused by a cleavable linker enables a receptor-specific delivery as well as a potent intracellular drug-release with high cytotoxic activity. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Breast cancer; Cytolysin; Neuropeptide Y; Peptide-drug conjugate; Quantitative proteomics; SILAC","McGregor, D.P., Discovering and improving novel peptide therapeutics (2008) Curr.

PET technique in combination with appropriate radiotracers could be the most convenient method for detection of Pgp function. Rhodamine derivatives are validated fluorescent probes for measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential and also Pgp function. The aim of this study was to investigate whether 2′[18F]-fluoroethylrhodamine B (18FRB) a halogenated rhodamine derivative previously synthesized for PET assessment of myocardial perfusion preserved its Pgp substrate character. ATPase assay as well as accumulation experiments carried out using Pgp+ and Pgp- human gynecologic (A2780/A2780AD and KB-3-1/KB-V1) and a mouse fibroblast cell pairs (NIH 3T3 and NIH 3T3 MDR1) were applied to study the interaction of 18FRB with Pgp. ATPase assay proved that 18FRB is a high affinity substrate of Pgp. Pgp- cells accumulated the 18FRB rapidly in accordance with its lipophilic character. Dissipation of the mitochondrial proton gradient by a proton ionophore CCCP decreased the accumulation of rhodamine 123 (R123) and 18FRB into Pgp- cells. Pgp+ cells exhibited very low R123 and 18FRB accumulation (around 1-8% of the Pgp- cell lines) which was not sensitive to the mitochondrial proton gradient; rather it was increased by the Pgp inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA). Based on the above data we conclude that 18FRB is a high affinity Pgp substrate and consequently a potential PET tracer to detect multidrug resistant tumors as well as the function of physiological barriers expressing Pgp. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, its use for the in vivo PDT of cancer has been limited due to the inherently poor cell/tissue accumulation and low biological stability in the free molecular form. Here, we report a simple and biocompatible nanocomplex formulation of MB (NanoMB) that is useful for in vivo locoregional cancer treatment by PDT. NanoMB particles were constructed through the self-assembly of clinically usable molecules (MB, fatty acid and a clinically approved polymer surfactant) directed by the dual (electrostatic and hydrophobic) interactions between the ternary constituents. The nanocomplexed MB showed greatly enhanced cell internalization while keeping the photosensitization efficiency as high as free MB, leading to distinctive phototoxicity toward cancer cells. When administered to human breast cancer xenograft mice by peritumoral injection, NanoMB was capable of facile penetration into the tumor followed by cancer cell accumulation, as examined in vivo and histologically with the near-infrared fluorescence signal of MB. The quintuple PDT treatment by a combination of peritumorally injected NanoMB and selective laser irradiation suppressed the tumor volume efficaciously, demonstrating potential of NanoMB-based PDT as a biocompatible and safe method for adjuvant locoregional cancer treatment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Directed molecular assembly; MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell; Methylene blue; Photodynamic therapy; Polymer nanoparticles","Bonnett, R., (2000) Chemical Aspects of Photodynamic Therapy, , Taylor & Francis; Dougherty, T.J., Gomer, C.J., Henderson, B.W., Jori, G., Kessel, D., Korbelik, M., Moan, J., Peng, Q., Photodynamic therapy (1998) J.

Additionally, the use of single chemotherapeutic drug has known limitations such as high toxicity profile due to the relatively high doses and limited regimen of clinical application. To this end, Pluronic P105-DOX conjugate was successfully designed and developed which can be further used as a hydrophobic core to entrap another anti-cancer drug PTX with Pluronic F127 to form the dual drug-loaded mixed micelles (PF-DP) in our study, which would offer great advantages over conventional micelles, including easy fabrication, high loading capacity, and co-delivery of hydrophilic DOX and hydrophobic PTX to achieve synergistic effect of these two drug substances. Results showed that PF-DP possessed a good polydispersity and sustained release profile for both DOX and PTX in vitro. Studies on cellular uptake demonstrated both anti-cancer drugs in PF-DP can effectively accumulate in MDR cancer cells. Furthermore, in vitro cytotoxicity, cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest studies indicated that PF-DP had better antitumor efficacy in MDR cancer cells compared to those of single-drug loaded micelles. It was also found that PF-DP can suppress the growth of tumor cells more efficiently than single drug formulations at the equivalent drug concentrations, suggesting synergistic effect could be achieved. More importantly, a much stronger antitumor efficacy in MCF-7/ADR tumor-bearing mice was observed in PF-DP group than that of combined administration of free DOX and PTX. Collectively, the dual drug-loaded Pluronic-based functional mixed micelles developed in this study might be a potential nano-drug delivery system for MDR cancer chemotherapy. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Anti-cancer efficacy; Codelivery; Doxorubicin; Multidrug resistance; Paclitaxel; Polymeric micelle","Abuhammad, S., Zihlif, M., Gene expression alterations in doxorubicin resistant MCF7 breast cancer cell line (2013) Genomics, 101, pp. 213-220; Ahmed, F., Pakunlu, R.I., Brannan, A., Bates, F., Minko, T., Discher, D.E., Biodegradable polymersomes loaded with both paclitaxel and doxorubicin permeate and shrink tumors, inducing apoptosis in proportion to accumulated drug (2006) J.

In the present study, heavy metal concentrations (Cr, Ni, Cu, Pb and Cd) were measured in five types of vegetables, soil, root, and settled air particle samples from two sites (at a domestic waste incinerator and at 20. km away from the incinerator) in Guangzhou, South China. Heavy metal concentrations in soil were greater than those in aerial parts of vegetables and roots, which indicated that vegetables bioaccumulated low amount of heavy metals from soil. The similar pattern of heavy metal (Cr, Cd) was found in the settled air particle samples and aerial parts of vegetables from two sites, which may suggest that foliar uptake may be an important pathway of heavy metal from the environment to vegetables. The highest levels of heavy metals were found in leaf lettuce (125.52. μg/g, dry weight) and bitter lettuce (71.2. μg/g) for sites A and B, respectively, followed by bitter lettuce and leaf lettuce for sites A and B, respectively. Swamp morning glory accumulated the lowest amount of heavy metals (81.02. μg/g for site A and 53.2. μg/g for site B) at both sites. The bioaccessibility of heavy metals in soil ranged from Cr (2%) to Cu (71.78%). Risk assessment showed that Cd and Pb in soil samples resulted in the highest non-cancer risk and Cd would result in unacceptable cancer risk for children and risk. The non-dietary intake of soil was the most important exposure pathway, when the bioaccessibility of heavy metals was taken into account. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Bioaccessibility; Heavy metals; Risk assessment; Waste incinerator","Ali, M.H.H., Al-Qahtani, K.M., Assessment of some heavy metals in vegetables, cereals and fruits in Saudi Arabian markets (2012) Egypt.

HER2 is also served as prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer because HER2 over-expression is associated with a 5-10% increase in cancer related death of gastric cancer. Cancer patients exhibiting HER2 over-expression can significantly improve their overall survival rates by taking the targeting drug Herceptin, which directly targets HER2. However, Herceptin has limited functions toward patients without HER2 over-expression and therefore it needs a highly specific and accurate detection method for diagnosis of HER2 over-expression. Currently, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique is routinely employed to detect HER2 amplification. However, it is a labor-intensive, time-consuming hybridization process and is relatively costly. Furthermore, well-trained personnel are required to operate the delicate and complicate process. More importantly, it may take 1-2 days for well-trained personnel to perform a whole FISH assay. Given these limitations, we developed a new, integrated microfluidic FISH system capable of automating the entire FISH protocol which could be performed within a shorter period of time when compared to traditional methods. The microfluidic FISH chip consisted of a microfluidic control module for transportation of small amounts of fluids and a hybridization module to perform the hybridization of DNA probes and cells/tissue samples. With this approach, the new microfluidic chip was capable of performing the whole FISH assay within 20. h. Four cell lines, two for non-. HER2 amplification and two for HER2 amplification, and two clinical tissue samples, one for non-. HER2 amplification and another for HER2 amplification, were used for verifications of the developed chip. Experimental data showed that there was no significant difference between the benchtop protocol and the chip-based protocol. Furthermore, the reagent consumption was greatly reduced (~70% reduction). Especially, only 2-μl usage for FISH deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probe was used, which is five-fold reduction when compared with the traditional method. It is the first time that the entire FISH assay could be automated on a single chip by using tissue samples. The microfluidic system developed herein is therefore promising for rapid, automatic diagnosis of HER2-related diseases by detecting the HER2 gene with minimal consumption of samples and reagents and has a great potential for future pharmacogenetic diagnostics and therapy. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Biomarker; Cancer; Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH); HER2; Herceptin; Microfluidics","Bruneau, G., Gross, M.S., Krieger, M., Bernheim, A., Thibault, J., Nguyen, V.C., Preparation of a human dopa decarboxylase CDNA probe by PCR and its assignment to Chromosome-7 (1990) Ann.

In this report, we developed a triangular silver nanoprism (AgNPRs) etching-based plasmonic biosensor for the detection of cancer biomarkers. The triangular AgNPRs-based plasmonic biosensor is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay combined with the enzyme-mediated surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of triangular AgNPRs. Triangular AgNPRs uses the immune response of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to trigger the glucose oxidase (GOx)-catalysed oxidation of glucose (Glu), producing hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide acts as an oxidant to etch the triangular AgNPRs into smaller spherical silver nanoparticles, which is accompanied by a substantial blueshift of the SPR peak and a colourimetric blue-to-purple change that can be observed by the naked eye. The SPR peak shift enables the quantitative assessment of PSA due to the remarkable colour change. The triangular AgNPRs-based plasmonic ELISA approach exhibited a quasilinear response to logarithmic PSA concentrations in the range of 10. fg/mL to 100. pg/mL with a limit of detection (LOD) of 4.1. fg/mL. In addition, the LOD of PSA in this approach exceeds that of the conventional HRP-based ELISA (1.25. ng/mL) approach by more than 5 orders of magnitude. Patient serum samples from 16 donors were assayed with triangular AgNPRs-based plasmonic ELISA. The results from the triangular AgNPRs-based immunoassay and the time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay showed excellent correlation, and there were no significant differences in the quantified amounts of PSA. The triangular AgNPRs-based plasmonic ELISA approach has advantages (ultrasensitive, cost-effective, ease of operation) that are expected to be of great interest in diagnostics and to be suitable for a point-of-care test. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Etching; Plasmonic biosensor; Signal amplification; Silver nanoprism","Ambrosi, A., Airo, F., Merkoci, A., (2010) Anal.

The peculiar biophysical profile and the atypical ionic channels activity shown by diverse types of human cancers suggest that ion channels may be possible targets in cancer therapy. Earlier studies have shown that melatonin exerts an oncostatic action on different tumors. In particular, it was shown that melatonin was able to inhibit growth/viability and proliferation, to reduce the invasiveness and metastatic properties of human estrogen-sensitive breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell line cultured in growth medium, with substantial impairments of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and Notch-1-mediated signaling. The purpose of this work was to evaluate on MCF-7 cells the possible effects of melatonin on the biophysical features known to have a role in proliferation and differentiation, by using the patch-clamp technique. Our results show that in cells cultured in growth as well as in differentiation medium melatonin caused a hyperpolarization of resting membrane potential paralleled by significant changes of the inward Ca2+ currents (T- and L-type), outward delayed rectifier K+ currents and cell capacitance. All these effects are involved in MCF-7 growth and differentiation. These findings strongly suggest that melatonin, acting as a modulator of different voltage-dependent ion channels, might be considered a new promising tool for specifically disrupting cell viability and differentiation pathways in tumour cells with possible beneficial effects on cancer therapy. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, σ<inf>2</inf> receptor is an intriguing target for tumor diagnosis and treatment despite the fact that that it has not yet been cloned. One of the last attempts to characterize σ<inf>2</inf> receptors led to identify it as the progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1). Although still controversial, such identity appears to have been accepted. We the aim of contributing to solve this controversy, in this work we stably silenced or overexpressed PGRMC1 protein in human MCF7 adenocarcinoma cells. Western blotting analyses were performed to quantify the presence of PGRMC1 protein on each of the three MCF7 cell lines variants, while scatchard analyses with radioligand were performed in order to determine the expression of the σ<inf>2</inf> receptors. In order to correlate the antiproliferative effect of σ<inf>2</inf> receptor agonist with PGRMC1 density, some σ<inf>2</inf> ligands were administered to each of the three MCF7 cells variants.

NPs with a mean diameter of approximately 200 nm, a narrow size distribution, and capable of efficient drug encapsulation were prepared using an emulsification-solvent evaporation method. The stability of NPs was verified in water, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and serum after 24-h incubation. A sustained drug release pattern was observed, and the amount of CUR released in acidic media (pH 5.5) was higher than in media at physiological pH (pH 7.4). Blank NPs (without drug loading) did not exhibit severe cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 human breast adenocarcinoma cells. The in vitro anti-tumor efficacy of CUR-loaded NPs in MDA-MB-231 cells was comparable to that of a solution of CUR. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed that the in vivo clearance (CL) of CUR in the NP-treated group was lower than the group treated with CUR solution. Therefore, encapsulation of CUR in PDLLA-G NPs was shown to enable prolonged circulation of the drug in the blood stream and guarantee improved anticancer activity after intravenous injection. These biocompatible NPs could be an efficient nano-sized injectable formulation for CUR delivery. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, the RGO-AuNPs modified screen printed electrodes were tested for NADH detection showing a wide dynamic range and a low detection limit. Next, the biosensor was constructed by incorporating both enzyme and RGO-AuNPs in a sol gel matrix derived from tetrametoxysilane and methyltrimetoxysilane. The enzyme loading, working pH, and coenzyme concentration were optimized. The biosensor linearly responded to l-lactate in the range of 10μM-5mM and showed a good specific sensitivity of 154μA/mMcm2 with a detection limit of 0.13μM. This was accompanied by good reproducibility and operational stability. Tests on artificial serum proved that l-lactate can be determined practically without interferences from commonly interfering compounds such as urate, paracetamol and l-ascorbate. Our LDH/RGO-AuNPs/SPCE based biosensor thus performs as electrochemical device for the detection of l-lactate as a viable early cancer bio-marker. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cancer biomarker; Gold nanoparticles; L-lactate; L-lactate dehydrogenase; NADH; Reduced graphene oxide","Bariskaner, H., Ustun, M.E., Ak, A., Yosunkaya, A., Dogan, N., Gurbilek, M., (2003) Methods Find.

However, the global profiling of miRNA expression in prostate cancer cells following treatment with AR ligands has not been reported so far. In this study we examined the effect of treatment with two AR agonists (mibolerone (MIB) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT)) and an AR antagonist (bicalutamide (BIC)) on miRNA expression in the human androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cell line using microarray technology and verification of selected miRNA using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). No miRNA was identified as differentially expressed following treatment with the AR antagonist BIC. In contrast, a number of common and compound-specific alterations in miRNA expression were observed following treatment with AR agonists. Unexpectedly it was found that treatment with the AR agonists resulted in the repression of miR-221, a miRNA previously established to be involved with prostate cancer development. This observation indicates that this miRNA may have a more complex role in prostate cancer development than considered previously. Treatment with MIB led to an induction of miR-210 expression, a hypoxia-related miRNA. This miRNA is reported to be involved in cell adaptation to hypoxia and thus induction in conditions of normoxia may be important in driving metabolic changes observed in prostate cancer. Thus examining the effect of AR agonists and antagonists on miRNA expression can provide novel insights into the response of cells to AR ligands and subsequent downstream events. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Androgen agonist; Androgen antagonist; MiR-210; MiR-221; Prostate cancer","BUF012A/B alamarBlue® Product Datasheet (2009), http://static.abdserotec.com/uploads/BUF012-technical-datasheet-2011pdf, Available from (accessed 01.07.12.)Camps, C., Buffa, F.M., Colella, S., Moore, J., Sotiriou, C., Sheldon, H., Harris, A.L., Ragoussis, J., Hsa-miR-210 is induced by hypoxia and is an independent prognostic factor in breast cancer (2008) Clin.

The proposed approach is able both to quantify the invasive capacity of the overall cell population and to evaluate selected determinants of single cell movement (velocity, directional movement, and final displacement). In this respect, the present CPM allows us to capture differences and correlations in the migratory behavior of cells initially located at different distances from the wound edge. In the case of an undifferentiated extracellular matrix, the model then predicts that a maximal healing can be obtained by a chemically induced increment of cell elasticity and not by a chemically induced downregulation of intercellular adhesive contacts. Moreover, in the case of two-component substrates (formed by a mesh of collagenous-like threads and by a homogeneous medium), CPM simulations show that both fiber number and cell-fiber adhesiveness influence cell speed and wound closure rate in a biphasic fashion. On the contrary, the topology of the fibrous network affects the healing process by mediating the productive directional cell movement. The paper, also equipped with comments on the computational cost of the CPM algorithm, ends with a throughout discussion of the pertinent experimental and theoretical literature. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cell compartmentalization; Cell migration; Cellular Potts Model; Extracellular matrix; Invasion front; Wound healing assay","Abercrombie, M., The crawling movement of cells (1980) Proc.

Tight junctions (TJ) in vertebrates define apical and basolateral membrane domains in polarized epithelia via bi-directional, complex signalling pathways between TJ themselves and the cytoskeleton they are associated with. RhoGTPases are central to these processes and evidence suggests that their regulation is coordinated by interactions between GEFs and GAPs with junctional, cytoplasmic adapter proteins. In this InFocus review we determine that the expression, localization or stability of a variety of these adaptor proteins is altered in various cancers, potentially representing an important mechanistic link between loss of polarity and cancer. We focus here, on two well characterized RhoGTPases Cdc42 and RhoA who's GEFs and GAPs are predominantly localized to TJ via cytoplasmic adaptor proteins. © 2015 The Authors.

Although a large number of studies have shown that CA9 is strongly up-regulated by HIF1-α, little is known about the negative regulation mechanism of CA9 in cancer cells. Here we find that CREB is a key negative regulator of CA9 in gastric cancer. Over-expression of CREB can significantly repress the expression of CA9. Treating with anisomycin (ANS), an activator of p38, the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of CREB are both promoted, while the transcription of CA9 is repressed. Besides, our results firstly identify that CREB can recruit SIRT1 (class III HDACS) by adaptor protein p300, then repress the expression of CA9. These findings may contribute to understand the negative regulation mechanisms of CA9 in gastric cancer. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.","CA9; CREB; Gastric cancer; Proliferation; SIRT1","Hilvo, M., Baranauskiene, L., Salzano, A.M., Scaloni, A., Matulis, D., Innocenti, A., Scozzafava, A., Parkkila, S., (2008) J.

In this study, we showed that emodin-inhibited NSCLC cell growth and increased phosphorylation of AMPKα and ERK1/2. In addition, emodin-inhibited ILK protein expression. The overexpression of ILK reversed the effect of emodin on cell growth inhibition. Furthermore, the blockade of AMPK by compound C abrogated, while metformin, an activator of AMPK, strengthened the effect of emodin on the inhibition of ILK expression. Interestingly, the inhibitor of MAPK extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK1/2 (PD98059) attenuated emodin-induced phosphorylation of AMPKα. Moreover, emodin reduced the protein expression of Sp1 and AP-1 subunit c-Jun. Exogenous expression of Sp1 and c-Jun diminished emodin-reduced ILK protein expression. Emodin suppressed ILK promoter activity, which was not observed in cells overexpression of Sp1 and treated with compound C. Intriguingly, exogenous expression of c-Jun overcame the emodin-inhibited Sp1 protein expression. Collectively, our results demonstrate that emodin inhibits ILK expression through AMPKα-mediated reduction of Sp1 and c-Jun. Metformin enhances the effects of emodin. Exogenous expression of Sp1 and c-Jun resists emodin-inhibited ILK promoter activity and protein expression. In addition, the overexpression of c-Jun diminishes emodin-induced AMPKα signaling. Thus, the crosstalk of AMPKα and MEK/ERK1/2 signaling and the reciprocal interaction between Sp1 and c-Jun proteins contribute to the overall responses of emodin. This novel signaling axis may be a therapeutic potential for prevention and treatment of NSCLC. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","AMPKα; C-Jun; Emodin; ILK; NSCLC; Sp1","Siegel, R., Naishadham, D., Jemal, A., (2013) CA Cancer J.

However, the influence of consumption of capsaicin-containing foods or vegetables on skin cancer patients remains largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that capsaicin has a cocarcinogenic effect on 9, 10-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced skin tumorigenesis. Our results showed that topical application of capsaicin on the dorsal skin of DMBA-initiated and TPA-promoted mice could significantly accelerate tumor formation and growth and induce more and larger skin tumors than the model group (DMBA + TPA). Moreover, capsaicin could promote TPA-induced skin hyperplasia and tumor proliferation. Mechanistic study found that inflammation-related factors cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were highly elevated by pretreatment with capsaicin, suggesting an inflammation-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, mice that were administered capsaicin exhibited significant up-regulation of phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB), Erk and p38 but had no effect on JNK. Thus, our results indicated that inflammation, Erk and P38 collectively played a crucial role in cancer-promoting effect of capsaicin on carcinogen-induced skin cancer in mice. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Capsaicin; COX-2; DMBA/TPA; INOS; Skin inflammation; Tumorigenesis","Arora, N., Bansal, M.P., Koul, A., Azadirachta indica exerts chemopreventive action against murine skin cancer: studies on histopathological, ultrastructural changes and modulation of NF-kappaB, AP-1, and STAT1 (2011) Oncol.

The adoption of the 10-4 risk estimate provides a theoretical and practical integration of two competing risk assessment models whose predictions cannot be validated in human population studies or with standard chronic animal bioassay data. This model-integration reveals both substantial protection of the population from cancer effects (i.e. functional utility of the LNT model) while offering the possibility of significant reductions in cancer incidence should the hormetic dose-response model predictions be correct. The dose yielding the 10-4 cancer risk therefore yields the optimized toxicologically based ""regulatory sweet spot"". © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Dose-response; Hormesis; Linearity; LNT; Precautionary principle; Risk assessment","Ames, B.N., Gold, L.S., Paracelsus to parascience: the environmental cancer distraction (2000) Mut.

Aberrant Wnt signaling pathways and miRNA levels lead to developmental defects and diverse human pathologies including but not limited to cancer. Wnt signaling pathways regulate a plethora of cellular processes during embryonic development and maintain homeostasis of adult tissues. A majority of Wnt signaling components are regulated by miRNAs which are small noncoding RNAs that are expressed in both animals and plants. In animal cells, miRNAs fine tune gene expression by pairing primarily to the 3'untranslated region of protein coding mRNAs to repress target mRNA translation and/or induce target degradation. miRNA-mediated regulation of signaling transduction pathways is important in modulating dose-sensitive response of cells to signaling molecules. This review discusses components of the Wnt signaling pathways that are regulated by miRNAs in the context of development and diseases. A fundamental understanding of miRNA functions in Wnt signaling transduction pathways may yield new insight into crosstalks of regulatory mechanisms essential for development and disease pathophysiology leading to novel therapeutics. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Cancer; Non-canonical Wnt signaling; Post-transcriptional regulation; Regulatory network; β-catenin","Clevers, H., (2006) Cell, 127 (3), pp. 469-480; Moon, R.T., Kohn, A.D., De Ferrari, G.V., Kaykas, A., (2004) Nat.

Since MVMp is an oncotropic virus, and galectin-3 is a multifunctional protein implicated in cancer metastasis, we hypothesized that galectin-3 and Mgat5, the Golgi enzyme that synthesizes high-affinity glycan ligands of galectin-3, might play a role in MVMp infection. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown of galectin-3 in mouse cells transformed with polyomavirus middle T antigen and Mgat5-/- mouse mammary tumor cells, we found that galectin-3 and Mgat5 are both necessary for efficient MVMp cell entry and infection, but not for cell binding. Moreover, we found that human cancer cells expressing higher levels of galectin-3 were more efficiently infected with MVMp than cell lines expressing lower galectin-3 levels. We conclude that galectin-3 and Mgat5 are involved in MVMp infection, and propose that galectin-3 is a determinant of MVMp oncotropism. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Galectin-3; Mgat5; Minute virus of mice; MVM; Parvovirus","Allaume, X., El-Andaloussi, N., Leuchs, B., Bonifati, S., Kulkarni, A., Marttila, T., Kaufmann, J.K., Marchini, A., Retargeting of rat parvovirus H-1PV to cancer cells through genetic engineering of the viral capsid (2012) J.

Disorientation of the collagen fiber network is a common phenomenon during cancer invasion process. In this study, using in vitro myoma organotypic model with invading melanoma and oral tongue carcinoma cell lines, we identified the influence of the cancer cells in the TME by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) imaging. We found major changes in the relative intensities of the collagen bands. Principal component analysis was performed to explore feasibility of classification between spectra extracted from different regions. A submolecular justification of the classification model was sought using a curve fitting analysis. Our preliminary results suggest that the features present in the amide and collagen triplet regions could serve as spectral markers for cancer-induced modifications in the TME. We suggest that FTIR method, combined with myoma invasion model, could be used to analyze various tumor cells interactions with TME during invasion processes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the delicate balance between the role of effector and memory cells on eliminating cancer cells remains an elusive problem in immunology. Here we make an initial investigation into this problem with the help of a mathematical model for oncolytic virotherapy; although the model can in fact be made general enough to be applied also to other immunological problems. According to this model, we find that long-term cancer control is associated with a large number of persistent effector cells (irrespective of the initial peak in effector cell numbers). However, this large number of persistent effector cells is sustained by a relatively large number of memory cells. Moreover, the results of the mathematical model suggest that cancer control from a dormant state cannot be predicted by the size of the memory population. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cancer modelling; Effector and memory cells; Tumour control; Tumour dormancy","Almog, N., Molecular mechanisms underlying tumor dormancy (2010) Cancer Lett., 294 (2), pp. 139-146; Antia, R., Pilyugin, S., Ahmed, R., Models of immune memory. on the role of cross-reactive stimulation, competition, and homeostasis in maintaining immune memory (1998) Proc.

The mutated EGFR proteins (EGFRs) are hyper-phosphorylated and refractory to receptor down-regulation. To address the discrepancy between hyper-phosphorylation and lack of down-regulation of mutant EGFRs, we have examined the expression of EGFR negative regulators in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. We found that NSCLC cell lines expressing mutant EGFRs often had low expression of various negative regulators for EGFR. Among them, tumor suppressor CD82 was up-regulated by wild type (WT) EGFR but down-regulated by mutant EGFRs. Reconstitution of CD82 exerted stronger suppressive effects on mutant EGFRs than on WT EGFR. Active exportation of CD82 through the exosome was one of the mechanisms involved in achieving the overall CD82 down-regulation in mutant EGFR-expressing lung cancer cell lines. Over-expression of mutant EGFR protein frequently occurred in the lung cancer tissues of mutant EGFR-transgenic mice and also associated with CD82 down-regulation. Immunoblot analyses on the tumor tissues from 23 lung adenocarcinoma patients (12 with WT EGFR, and 11 with mutant EGFRs) also identified significantly stronger down-regulation of CD82 in tumors with mutant EGFRs than WT. Our data indicate that CD82 down-regulation could be a critical step involved in the EGFR over-expression and the stronger tumorigenic activity triggered by EGFR mutations. Up-regulation of the CD82 level may become a promising new treatment strategy for lung adenocarcinoma. © 2015.","CD82; EGFR mutation; Exosome; Lung cancer","Citri, A., Yarden, Y., EGF-ErbB signalling: towards the systems level (2006) Nat.

Among the immune effectors regulated in response to immunostimulants, host defense peptides (HDPs) are abundantly expressed in epithelial linings, suggesting their important role in the mucosal immune response. Therefore, the immunomodulatory properties of expressed HDPs in the epithelial intestinal cells of rainbow trout in response to the β-glucan, zymosan, were assessed. The results showed that zymosan increased the production of the HDP, cathelicidin, and the cytokine, IL-1β, in the intestinal epithelial RTgutGC cell line at the transcript and protein levels. Thus, cathelicidin-2 variants were produced and were shown to (i) induce the production of IL-1β in RTgutGC cells and (ii) display a synergic effect with zymosan in IL-1β upregulation. Importantly, the colocalization of both rtCATH-2 and IL-1β was detected in the intestinal epithelial cells of rainbow trout fed with a 0.3% zymosan-supplemented diet. We propose that trout cathelicidins are expressed by intestinal epithelial cells and exert immunomodulatory effects to improve the local intestinal immune response triggered by immunostimulants. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Fish IL-1β; Host defense peptides; Immunostimulation; Intestinal epithelial cells; Mucosal immunity","Ángeles Esteban, M., An Overview of the Immunological Defenses in Fish Skin (2012) ISRN Immunol. 2012, pp. 1-29; Bethke, J., Rojas, V., Berendsen, J., Cárdenas, C., Guzmán, F., Gallardo, J.A., Development of a new antibody for detecting natural killer enhancing factor (NKEF)-like protein in infected salmonids (2012) J.

In prostate external beam radiation therapy, it allows the propagation of MR-derived contours to reference CT images at the planning stage, and it enables dose mapping during dosimetry studies. The use of carefully registered CT-MR atlases allows the estimation of patient specific electron density maps from MRI scans, enabling MRI-alone radiation therapy planning and treatment adaptation. In all cases, the precision and accuracy achieved by registration influences the quality of the entire process.Problem: Most current registration algorithms do not robustly generalize and lack inverse-consistency, increasing the risk of human error and acting as a source of bias in studies where information is propagated in a particular direction, e.g. CT to MR or vice versa. In MRI-based treatment planning where both CT and MR scans serve as spatial references, inverse-consistency is critical, if under-acknowledged.Purpose: A robust, inverse-consistent, rigid/affine registration algorithm that is well suited to CT-MR alignment in prostate radiation therapy is presented.Method: The presented method is based on a robust block-matching optimization process that utilises a half-way space definition to maintain inverse-consistency. Inverse-consistency substantially reduces the influence of the order of input images, simplifying analysis, and increasing robustness. An open source implementation is available online at http://aehrc.github.io/Mirorr/.Results: Experimental results on a challenging 35 CT-MR pelvis dataset demonstrate that the proposed method is more accurate than other popular registration packages and is at least as accurate as the state of the art, while being more robust and having an order of magnitude higher inverse-consistency than competing approaches.Conclusion: The presented results demonstrate that the proposed registration algorithm is readily applicable to prostate radiation therapy planning. © 2015.","Inverse-consistent registration; Multimodal registration; Prostate cancer; Radiation therapy; Robust","Alexa, M., Linear combination of transformations (2002) In: Proceedings of ACM SIGGRAPH 2002.

Drugs that mimic the activity of death ligands, or antagonise pro-survival proteins of the Bcl-2 or IAP families have yielded encouraging results in animal experiments and early phase clinical trials. Because these agents directly engage apoptosis pathways, rather than damaging DNA to indirectly provoke tumour cell death, we reasoned that they may offer another important advantage over conventional therapies: minimisation or elimination of side effects such as second cancers that result from mutation of surviving normal cells. Disappointingly, however, we previously found that concentrations of death receptor agonists like TRAIL that would be present in vivo in clinical settings provoked DNA damage in surviving cells. In this study, we used cell line model systems to investigate the mutagenic capacity of drugs from two other classes of direct apoptosis-inducing agents: the BH3-mimetic ABT-737 and the IAP antagonists LCL161 and AT-406. Encouragingly, our data suggest that IAP antagonists possess negligible genotoxic activity. Doses of ABT-737 that were required to damage DNA stimulated Bax/Bak-independent signalling and exceeded concentrations detected in the plasma of animals treated with this drug. These findings provide hope that cancer patients treated by BH3-mimetics or IAP antagonists may avoid mutation-related illnesses that afflict some cancer survivors treated with conventional DNA-damaging anti-cancer therapies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Bcl-2; DNA damage; Genotoxic; IAP; Late effects; Second malignant neoplasms","Joannides, M., Grimwade, D., Molecular biology of therapy-related leukaemias (2010) Clin.

In the current study, chitosan (CS) encapsulated naringenin (NAR) nanoparticles (CS-NPs/NAR) were synthesized by ionic gelation method mediated by tripolyphosphate (TPP) as a cross-linker and characterized by DLS, SEM, Zeta potential, FT-IR and EDS analyses. The encapsulation efficiency of CS-NPs/NAR was determined by Folin-Ciocalteau (FC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques. The native CS-NPs were found to be sized at 53.2. nm, while an increase in the size to 407.47. nm was observed upon loading with NAR. The encapsulation efficiency of CS-NPs/NAR was identified to be ~70% by FC method and ~80% by HPLC method, respectively. The release of NAR from CS-NPs/NAR in simulated gastric fluid was found to be ~15% and remaining 85% of NAR was entrapped in CS-NPs/NAR. Furthermore, the free radical scavenging ability of CS-NPs/NAR was studied by Nitrate scavenging, 2, 2-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl hydrate and hydroxyl radical scavenging assays. The free radical scavenging activity was significantly higher in CS-NPs/NAR. MTT based cytotoxic analysis also depicted the non-toxic nature of CS-NPs/NAR towards normal fibroblast 3T3 cells, while cytotoxic effects were noticed against A549 lung cancer cells. Hence, the current investigations showed the superiority of chitosan encapsulated NAR over free NAR and suggested an efficient system for delivering NAR with antioxidant and anticancer activities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Chitosan; Lung cancer cells; Nanoparticles; Naringenin","Lodhi, G., Kim, Y.-S., Hwang, J.-W., Kim, S.-K., Jeon, Y.-J., Je, J.-Y., Chitooligosaccharide and its derivatives: preparation and biological applications (2014) BioMed Res.

Comparison of PAH concentrations during different periods, with different air mass origins and under different pollution situations was done. Sources were analyzed by diagnostics ratios and principal component analysis (PCA). The threat of PAHs was assessed by BaP equivalent concentrations (BaPeq) and incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR). The averaged PAHs for pre-SF, SF and after SF periods were 50.6, 17.2 and 29ngm-3, indicating the variations of PAH sources, with reduced traffic, industrial and construction activities during SF and gradually re-starting of them after-SF. According to PAH mass concentrations, their relative abundance to particles, ratio of PAHs (3-ring+4-ring)/PAHs(5-ring+6-ring), mass concentrations of combustion-derived and carcinogenic PAHs, fireworks burning is an important source for PAHs during SF. The ILCR values for Chinese New Year day were 0.68 and 3.3 per 100,000 exposed children and adults. It suggested the necessity of controlling fireworks burning during Chinese SF period which was always companied with serious regional haze pollution. PAH concentrations exhibited decreasing trend when air masses coming from the following directions as North China Plain (63.9ngm-3)&gt;Central China (53.0ngm-3)&gt;Shandong Peninsula (46.6ngm-3)&gt;Northwest China (18.8ngm-3)&gt;Sea (15.8ngm-3). For different pollution situations, they decreased as haze (44.5ngm-3)&gt;fog-haze (28.4ngm-3)&gt;clear (12.2ngm-3)&gt;fog day (9.2ng m-3). Coal combustion, traffic emission, industrial processes and petroleum (only for non-SF holiday periodss) were the main sources of PM2.5 associated PAHs. Fireworks burning contributed 14.0% of PAHs during SF period. Directly measurement of PAHs from fireworks burning is urgently needed for source apportionment studies in the future. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Firework burning; Haze; Health risk; PM2.5; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Source identification","Akyüz, M., Çabuk, H., Meteorological variations of PM2.5/PM10 concentrations and particle-associated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the atmospheric environment of Zonguldak, Turkey (2009) J.

In this work, inorganic arsenic (iAs) in these crops was separated and enriched by solid phase extraction (SPE), and quantified by hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS). Overall, iAs in these crops ranged from 0.9 to 14.1ngg-1 wet weight. Long-term cancer risk associated with iAs intake from these crops was assessed by Monte Carlo simulation based on iAs concentrations and historical consumption and population data. For 19 high RTP consuming SSA countries, life-time cancer risk was low with a mean target risk at 6.3×10-5 and a margin of exposure at 72. © 2015.","Aroid; Cancer risk; Cassava; Inorganic arsenic; Plantain; Potato; Root and tuber; Sweet potato; Yam","Adomako, E.E., Williams, P.N., Deacon, C., Meharg, A.A., Inorganic arsenic and trace elements in Ghanaian grain staples (2011) Environmental Pollution, 159, pp. 2435-2442; Alam, M.G.M., Snow, E.T., Tanaka, A., Arsenic and heavy metal contamination of vegetables grown in Samta village, Bangladesh (2003) Science of the Total Environment, 308, pp. 83-96; Balasubramanian, V., Sie, M., Hijmans, R.J., Otsuka, K., Increasing Rice production in sub-Saharan Africa: challenges and opportunities (2007) Advances in agronomy, 94, pp. 55-133. , Academic Press; Beal, S., Ways to fit a PK model with some data below the quantification limit (2001) Journal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics, 28 (5), pp. 481-504; Carbonell-Barrachina Á, A., Wu, X., Ramírez-Gandolfo, A., Norton, G.J., Burló, F., Deacon, C., Inorganic arsenic contents in rice-based infant foods from Spain, UK, China and USA (2012) Environmental Pollution, 163, pp. 77-83; Castro-Larragoitia, J., Kramar, U., Puchelt, H., 200 years of mining activities at La Paz/San Luis Potosí/Mexico - Consequences for environment and geochemical exploration (1997) Journal of Geochemical Exploration, 58, pp. 81-91; Chen, G., Chen, T., SPE speciation of inorganic arsenic in rice followed by hydride-generation atomic fluorescence spectrometric quantification (2014) Talanta, 119, pp. 202-206; (2011) Discussion paper on guidance for risk management options on how to deal with the results from new risk assessment methodologies (CX/CF 11/511) for the Fifth Session of the Codex Committee on Contaminants in Foods.

Tri- and diorganotin(IV) carboxylates adopt trigonal-bipyramidal and octahedral geometry around tin atom, respectively. They have been screened in vitro for anti-tumor activity against cancer cell lines of human origin, viz. MCF-7 (mammary), HEK-293 (kidney), PC-3 (prostate), HCT-15 (colon) and HepG-2 (liver). Enzyme assays viz. lipid peroxidase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and total glutathione assay have been carried out to explore the cause of their cytotoxiciy. The results indicate that ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation may be responsible for their cytotoxicity but elevation in LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) suggests that necrosis cannot be excluded. Further, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) fragmentation, acridine orange and comet assay support the fact that the apoptosis is the main cause of cytotoxicity of organotin(IV) carboxylates, whereas the necrosis plays a minor role. The anti-inflammatory activity evaluation shows that the complexes possess moderate activity. Results of acute toxicity of the complexes have also been discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between NK-1 and EGFR in triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs). Immunohistochemistry was performed to investigate NK-1 and EGFR expressions in TNBCs. [Sar9, \Met(O2)11] substance P (SMSP) was used to activate NK-1 in two TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468. L-733060 and siRNA against NK-1 were used to inhibit NK-1. The in vitro regulatory effect of NK-1 was determined using CCK-8 proliferation assay. The effects of NK-1 activation and inhibition on EGFR and its downstreaming pathway were analyzed using western blot and real-time quantitative PCR. We found that the proportion of EGFR positive cases was increased with the increasement of NK-1 levels. SMSP could promote the proliferation of TNBC cells, while L-733060 and siRNA could inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. Moreover, SMSP could enhance expressions of phosphorylation (p)-EGFR and EGFR, and activate p-Akt and p-Erk. NK1-siRNA could decrease p-EGFR, p-Akt and p-Erk. In the presence of cetuximab (0.2mg/mL), SMSP still could stimulate cell proliferation, and activate p-EGFR. However, in the presence of erlotinib (10μM), SMSP could not stimulate cell proliferation and could not activate p-EGFR. Our study showed the interaction between NK-1 and EGFR in TNBCs. These results suggested that NK-1 may regulate TNBC proliferation through EGFR phosphorylation, and the curative effect of EGFR monoclonal antibodies may be affected by NK-1 activation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Cetuximab; EGFR; Neurokinin-1; Substance P; Triple negative breast cancer","Dent, R., Trudeau, M., Pritchard, K.I., Hanna, W.M., Kahn, H.K., Sawka, C.A., Lickley, L.A., Narod, S.A., (2007) Clin.

A number of studies have found that highly educated women are more likely to be diagnosed with the disease. Breast cancer is therefore often labeled as a ""welfare disease"". However, it has not been established whether the strong positive correlation holds up when education is exogenously determined. We estimate the causal effect of education on the probability of being diagnosed with breast cancer by exploiting an education reform that extended compulsory schooling and was implemented as a social experiment. We find that the incidence of breast cancer increased for those exposed to the reform. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Breast cancer; Education gradient in health; Schooling reform","Althius, M., Global trends in breast cancer incidence and mortality 1973-1997 (2005) International Journal of Epidemiology, 34 (2), pp. 405-412; Baquet, C., Horm, J., Gibbs, T., Greenwald, P., Socio-economic factors and cancer incidence among Blacks and Whites (1990) Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 83 (8), pp. 551-557; Barlow, L., The completeness of the Swedish Cancer Register - a sample survey for year 1998 (2009) Acta Oncologica, 48 (1), pp. 27-33; Braaten, T., Weiderpass, E., Kumle, M., Adami, H.-O., Lund, E., Education and risk of breast cancer in the Norwegian-Swedish women's lifestyle and health cohort study (2004) International Journal of Cancer, 110 (4), pp. 579-583; (2006) Cancer Incidence in Sweden 2004, , Center for Epidemiology, National Board of Health and Welfare, Stockholm; Clark, D., Royer, H., The effect of education on adult mortality and health: evidence from Britain (2012) American Economic Review, 103 (6), pp. 2087-2120; Cutler, D., Lleras-Muney, A., Education and health: evaluating theories and evidence (2006) The Health Effects of Social and Economic Policy, , Russell Sage Foundation, New York, J.S.

For instance, podophyllotoxin the active ingredient of Podophyllum peltatum L. (Berberidaceae) used by Native Americans to treat warts led to the development of etoposide and teniposide. In the present investigation, we studied 10 medicinal plants used by the Gwich'in First Nation of West-Canada, which have been used against diverse diseases including cancer. Material and methods: Sensitive and multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumor cell lines expressing various ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (P-glycoprotein/ABCB1/MDR1, MRP1/ABCC1, or BCRP/ABCG2) have been used. Cytotoxicity was determined by the resazurin assay. Results: Arctium minus Bernh. (Asteraceae). Lysichiton americanus Hultén & St. John (Araceae), and Maianthemum dilatatum (Alph.Wood) A.Nelson & J.F.Macbr.(Asparagaceae) were cytotoxic with IC<inf>50</inf> values ranging from 2.40 to 86.35 μg/mL. The MDR cell lines did not exert cross-resistance to these extracts. Conclusion: As these medicinal plants of the West-Canadian Gwich'in First Nation were not involved in classical drug resistance mechanisms and might therefore be valuable to bypass anticancer drug resistance in refractory tumors. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Herein, a phenanthrolin-dicarboxylate ester (PD) is proved to exhibit selectivity toward parallel and hybrid G-quadruplex structures with propeller and edge-wise loops, over duplex DNA and antiparallel quadruplex structure with diagonal loop. Such preferred binding of PD to these special G-quadruplex structures is possibly resulted from steric hindrance of: (1) the four substituent groups in PD molecule which prevent close interaction with duplex DNA and (2) the diagonal loop above the G-tetrads in antiparallel G-quadruplex which hinder face-to-face stacking of planar phenanthrolin ring to G-tetrads. In line with its stabilizing ability of G-quadruplex, PD molecule exhibit a inhibitory ability telomerase activity, as well as the potent cytotoxic activity against several human cancer cell lines, which makes it an interesting anti-tumor drug lead. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","G-quadruplex; Phenanthroline derivative; Selectivity","Neidle, S., (2010) FEBS, 277, pp. 1118-1125; Harley, C.B., (2008) Nat.

Although surface modifications provide a suitable system for expanding the bioapplication of MNPs, the viability and the cellular internalization of modified MNPs which stands for their biocompatibility and efficiency in application need to be examined urgently. In present study, human lung cancer cells (A549), a well-known epithelial cell model for drug metabolism research, were used to evaluate the effects of strong SMFs on cellular internalization and cell viability of Fe3O4 MNPs modified by chitosan, dextran, polyacrylamide, polyethylene glycol, phosphatidylcholine, cationic-charged and anionic-charged. The cationic-charged and phosphatidylcholine-coated Fe3O4 MNPs could increase the cellular uptaken in a dose dependent manner and the particles caused a vacuolar appearance in A549 cells. With exposure to 8.5 T SMF, the assay of ATP content showed that anionic-charged and phosphatidylcholine-coated Fe3O4 MNPs changed the energy metabolism of A549 cells, which might be consistent with the observation in cellular internalization. The cell viability and proliferation of A549 cells were all slightly affected by various modified MNPs with or without 8.5 T SMF exposure. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Cellular internalization; Magnetic nanoparticles; Strong static magnetic field; Surface modification","Zhang, Q.A., Tong, J.L., Chen, H.J., Jiang, L.L., Zhu, H.P., Zhu, X.F., Yu, H., Liu, B.R., (2012) J.

Genetic factors as well as environmental factors play a role in development of gastric cancer. To investigate the independent roles of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in base excision repair (BER) genes (APE1 and NEIL2), carcinogen metabolism gene (CYP2E1) and tumor suppressor pathway gene (MDM2) for gastric cancer susceptibility in a Chinese population, we conducted a hospital based case-control study to evaluate the potential association between these polymorphisms and susceptibility to gastric cancer in a Northern Jiangsu population. We also associated the NEIL-2 mRNA expression with the studied NEIL2 SNP genotypes to assess whether the genotypes have influence on the NEIL2 mRNA (hence protein) expression. Five SNPs, APE 1 (rs2275008), NEIL 2 (rs804270), MDM2 (rs2279744), and CYP 2E1 (rs2480256 and rs2031920), were genotyped by TaqMan assays in 105 gastric cancer cases and 118 controls. Genotype frequency distribution showed that the APE 1 SNP (rs2275008), NEIL 2 SNP (rs804270), MDM2 SNP (rs2279744), and CYP 2E1 SNP (rs2031920) had more mutant alleles in gastric cancer cases than controls (76.19, 68.57, 54.29, and 43.81%, respectively), while CYP 2E1 SNP (rs2480256) had large percentage of both alleles (43.81%). Risk analysis revealed that there was increased risk for gastric cancer in subjects with mutant alleles in APE 1 (rs2275008: OR 5.49, 95% CI = 2 -6-5.7, p<-0001), NEIL 2 (rs804270: OR 2.3, 95% CI =1.22-4.3, p =0.01), MDM2 (rs2279744: OR 14.65, 95% CI = 5 -63-8.15, p < -0001), and CYP 2E1 (rs2031920: OR 8.385, 95% CI = 3-2-5.3, p <-0001) SNPs. Moreover, the NEIL2 mRNA expression analysis showed that there was significant differential expression of NEIL2 mRNA among the randomly tested NEIL2 genotypes (p = 0 -005), with low expression seen in variant genotypes than in other genotypes. In conclusion, variant alleles in the NEIL2 (rs804270), APE1 (rs2275008), CYP2E1 (rs2031920) and MDM2 (rs2279744) SNPs may independently influence susceptibility to gastric cancer in a Northern Jiangsu Chinese population. The genotypes may also independently influence their respective gene mRNA expression, as seen in our study, where there was differential expression of the NEIL2 mRNA among the genotypes, with low NEIL2 mRNA expression seen in the variant genotype.

Numerous studies involve EDs exposure to initiation and development of cancers, including prostate cancer. In this work, three different EDs (aldrin, aroclor 1254 and chlorpyrifos (CPF)) were investigated as potential inducers of a malignant phenotype in DU145 prostate cancer cells after a chronic exposure. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction, proliferation, migration, colony formation and release of metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) were analyzed in 50-day exposed cells to the selected EDs. As a result, aldrin and CPF exposure led to an EMT induction (loss of 16% and 14% of E-cadherin levels, respectively, compared to the unexposed cells). Aroclor and CPF presented an increased migration (134% and 126%, respectively), colony formation (204% and 144%, respectively) and MMP-2 release (137% in both cases) compared to the unexposed cells. An untargeted lipidomic analysis was performed to decipher the lipids involved in the observed transformations. As general results, aldrin exposure showed a global decrease in phospholipids and sphingolipids, and aroclor and CPF showed an increase of certain phospholipids, glycosphingolipids as well as a remarkable increase of some cardiolipin species. Furthermore, the three exposures resulted in an increase of some triglyceride species. In conclusion, some significant changes in lipids were identified and thus we postulate that some lipid compounds and lipid metabolic pathways could be involved in the acquisition of the malignant phenotype in exposed prostate cancer cells to the selected EDs. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Chemometrics; Chronic exposure; Endocrine disruptors; Prostate cancer; Untargeted lipidomics","Alavanja, M.C., Samanic, C., Dosemeci, M., Lubin, J., Tarone, R., Lynch, C.F., Knott, C., Blair, A., Use of agricultural pesticides and prostate cancer risk in the Agricultural Health Study cohort (2003) Am.

Since emricasan is an irreversible pan-caspase inhibitor that potently inhibits caspase-mediated apoptosis and inflammation, its carcinogenic potential was evaluated in a humanized mouse model. Tg.rasH2 mice received LabDiet formulated with 0, 10, 25, and 75. mg/kg/day of emricasan, for 26. weeks. At terminal sacrifice, blood was collected for clinical pathology analysis and tissues were collected, processed, and evaluated microscopically. There were no treatment related deaths or overt signs of toxicity for the duration of the study. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect in the peripheral blood leukocyte counts. Liver microgranulomas, which are background lesions, were slightly increased, especially in males. Increases in the incidence of the activated germinal centers were seen in the spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes of males and females, and in the mandibular lymph nodes of male mice. Atrophy of ovaries and testicular degeneration were also seen in emricasan treated animals. Although several non-neoplastic lesions were observed, there was no evidence of emricasan-related tumor formation in any tissue. In addition, the non-neoplastic lesions were not considered pre-neoplastic. Thus, emricasan is not considered carcinogenic. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Carcinogenicity; Caspase inhibitor; Emricasan; Emricasan; IDN-6556; Tg.rasH2","Alden, C.L., Lynn, A., Bourdeau, A., Morton, D., Sistare, F.D., Kadambi, V.J., Silverman, L., A critical review of the effectiveness of rodent pharmaceutical carcinogenesis testing in predicting for human risk (2011) Vet.

Since rAML is considered to originate from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), we investigated the frequency and spectrum of radiation-induced chromosomal abnormalities in human CD34+ cells. We then measured stable chromosomal abnormalities, a possible biomarker of leukemia risk, in clonally expanded cell populations which were grown for 14 days in a 3D-matrix (CFU-assay). We compared two radiation qualities used in radiotherapy, sparsely ionizing X-rays and densely ionizing carbon ions (29 and 60-85keV/μm, doses between 0.5 and 4Gy). Only a negligible number of de novo arising, unstable aberrations (≤0.05 aberrations/cell, 97% breaks) were measured in the descendants of irradiated HSPC. However, stable aberrations were detected in colonies formed by irradiated HSPC. All cells of the affected colonies exhibited one or more identical aberrations, indicating their clonal origin. The majority of the clonal rearrangements (92%) were simple exchanges such as translocations (77%) and pericentric inversions (15%), which are known to contribute to the development of rAML. Carbon ions were more efficient in inducing cell killing (maximum of ~30-35% apoptotic cells for 2Gy carbon ions compared to ~25% for X-rays) and chromosomal aberrations in the first cell-cycle after exposure (~70% and ~40% for 1Gy of carbon ions and X-rays, respectively), with a higher fraction of non-transmissible aberrations. In contrast, for both radiation qualities the percentage of clones with chromosomal abnormalities was similar (40%). Using the frequency of colonies with clonal aberrations as a surrogate marker for the leukemia risk following radiotherapy of solid tumors, charged particle therapy is not expected to lead to an increased risk of leukemia in patients. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon ions; Cell death; Clonal chromosomal abnormalities; Genomic instability; Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells; Ionizing radiation","Allan, J.M., Travis, L.B., Mechanisms of therapy-related carcinogenesis (2005) Nat.

We report here that airborne particulate matter, resulting from industrial pollution, inhibits expression and specifically affects alternative splicing at the 5' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the bone morphogenetic protein BMP4 in human colon cells in culture. These effects are consistent with a previously reported role for BMP4 in preventing colon cancer development, suggesting that ingestion of particulate matter could contribute to the onset of colon cell proliferation. We also show that the underlying mechanism might involve changes in transcriptional elongation. This is the first study to demonstrate that particulate matter causes non-pleiotropic changes in alternative splicing. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Alternative splicing; Bone morphogenetic protein; Colon cancer cells; Particulate matter","Alló, M., Buggiano, V., Fededa, J.P., Petrillo, E., Schor, I., de la Mata, M., Agirre, E., Kornblihtt, A.R., Control of alternative splicing through siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing (2009) Nat.

Granada, University of Granad CIBERESP, Spain","The aim of this study was to investigate the association between serum concentrations of a group of organochlorine pesticides/polychlorinated biphenyls with xenoestrogenic potential and the risk of breast cancer in a female population from Tunisia. The relationship between serum levels of the pollutants and the risk of cancer was assessed using logistic regression analyses. In the unadjusted models, β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH), hexachlorobenzene, heptachlor, polychlorinated biphenyl congeners 138, 153, and 180, and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) were positively associated with breast cancer risk. However, when the models were further adjusted for the selected covariates, only β-HCH and p,p'-DDE remained statistically significant, and heptachlor was borderline significant. In addition, analyses using POP concentration tertiles corroborated a positive dose-response relationship that was significant for p,p'-DDE (p-trend. = 0.020) and borderline significant for heptachlor (p-trend. = 0.078). A similar trend was also confirmed for β-HCH, in which concentrations. ≥. limit of detection were positively associated with breast cancer risk (vs. concentrations. <. limit of detection, OR. = 3.44, p. <. 0.05). Finally, the relative influence of each chemical in the presence of the others was assessed by entering the three chemicals in a single model with all covariates, and only β-HCH remained positively associated with the risk of cancer (OR:1.18, 95%CI: 1.05-1.34).Our findings suggest a potential association between exposure to at least one organochlorine pesticide and breast cancer risk. However, our results should be interpreted with caution, and further research is warranted to confirm these findings. © 2015.","Breast cancer; Endocrine disruptors; Organochlorine pesticides; Persistent organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls","Adami, H.O., Lipworth, L., Titus-Ernstoff, L., Hsieh, C.C., Hanberg, A., Ahlborg, U., Baron, J., Trichopoulos, D., Organochlorine compounds and estrogen-related cancers in women (1995) Cancer Causes Control, 6, pp. 551-566; Agudo, A., Goni, F., Etxeandia, A., Vives, A., Millan, E., Lopez, R., Amiano, P., Gonzalez, C.A., Polychlorinated biphenyls in Spanish adults: determinants of serum concentrations (2009) Environ.

Based on mouse xenograft experiments, where ERCC1-deficient melanomas were cured by cisplatin therapy, we proposed that inhibition of ERCC1-XPF could enhance the effectiveness of platinum-based chemotherapy. Here we report the identification and properties of inhibitors against two key targets on ERCC1-XPF. By targeting the ERCC1-XPF interaction domain we proposed that inhibition would disrupt the ERCC1-XPF heterodimer resulting in destabilisation of both proteins. Using in silico screening, we identified an inhibitor that bound to ERCC1-XPF in a biophysical assay, reduced the level of ERCC1-XPF complexes in ovarian cancer cells, inhibited Nucleotide Excision Repair and sensitised melanoma cells to cisplatin. We also utilised high throughput and in silico screening to identify the first reported inhibitors of the other key target, the XPF endonuclease domain. We demonstrate that two of these compounds display specificity in vitro for ERCC1-XPF over two other endonucleases, bind to ERCC1-XPF, inhibit Nucleotide Excision Repair in two independent assays and specifically sensitise Nucleotide Excision Repair-proficient, but not Nucleotide Excision Repair-deficient human and mouse cells to cisplatin. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","DNA repair inhibitor; ERCC1-XPF; FANCQ; Interstrand Crosslink Repair; Melanoma; Nucleotide Excision Repair; Ovarian cancer","(2015), http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/, CancerStats, Cancer Research UKKorman, J.B., Fisher, D.E., Developing melanoma therapeutics: overview and update (2013) Wiley Interdiscip.

For the first time, the use of the FMTWI technique for the detection and the differentiation of skin cancer has been demonstrated in this article. A three dimensional multilayered skin has been considered with the counter-current blood vessels in individual skin layers along with different stages of cancerous lesions based on geometrical, thermal and physical parameters available in the literature. Transient surface thermal responses of melanoma during FMTWI of skin cancer have been obtained by integrating the heat transfer model for biological tissue along with the flow model for blood vessels. It has been observed from the numerical results that, flow of blood in the subsurface region leads to a substantial alteration on the surface thermal response of the human skin. The alteration due to blood flow further causes a reduction in the performance of the thermal imaging technique during the thermal evaluation of earliest melanoma stages (small volume) compared to relatively large volume. Based on theoretical study, it has been predicted that the method is suitable for detection and differentiation of melanoma with comparatively large volume than the earliest development stages (small volume). The study has also performed phase based image analysis of the raw thermograms to resolve the different stages of melanoma volume. The phase images have been found to be clearly individuate the different development stages of melanoma compared to raw thermograms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioheat transfer; Blood flow; Medical imaging; Skin cancer; Thermal wave imaging","Absalan, H., SalmanOgli, A., Rostami, R., Maghoul, A., Simulation and investigation of quantum dot effects as internal heat-generator source in breast tumor site (2012) J.

To reduce CRC-related mortality, persons with a positive gFOBT must have colonoscopy. We identified factors associated with failure to have colonoscopy within 6. months of a positive gFOBT. Methods: Population-based, retrospective cohort analysis of CCC participants with positive gFOBT (April 2008 to December 2009) using health administrative data. Patient, physician and health care utilization factors associated with a lack of follow-up colonoscopy were identified using descriptive and multivariate analyses. Results: There were 21,839 participants with a positive gFOBT; 14,091 (64%) had colonoscopy within 6. months. The strongest factors associated with failure to follow-up were recent colonoscopy (in 2. years prior vs. >. 10. years or never, OR: 4.31, 95% C.I.: 3.82, 4.86), as well as repeat gFOBT (OR: 6.08, 95% C.I.: 5.46, 6.78) and hospital admission (OR: 4.35, 95% C.I.: 3.57, 5.26) in the follow-up period. Conclusion: In the first 18. months of the CCC Program, 1/3 of those with a positive gFOBT did not have colonoscopy within 6. months.

Endoxifen and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHTam) are two metabolites of the widely used anticancer drug tamoxifen for the prevention and treatment of breast cancers. Both metabolites have a high pharmacological potency in vertebrates, attributing prodrug characteristics to tamoxifen. Tamoxifen and its metabolites are body-excreted by patients, and the parent compound is found in sewage treatment plan effluents and natural waters. The toxicity of these potent metabolites on non-target aquatic species is unknown, which forces environmental risk assessors to predict their toxicity on aquatic species using knowledge on the parent compounds. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity of two generations of the freshwater microcrustacean Daphnia pulex towards 4OHTam and endoxifen. Two chronic tests of 4OHTam and endoxifen were run in parallel and several endpoints were assessed. The results show that the metabolites 4OHTam and endoxifen induced reproductive and survival effects. For both metabolites, the sensitivity of D. pulex increased in the second generation. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) decreased with increasing 4OHTam and endoxifen concentrations. The No-Observed Effect Concentrations (NOECs) calculated for the reproduction of the second generation exposed to 4OHTam and endoxifen were <. 1.8 and 4.3. μg/L, respectively, whereas the NOECs that were calculated for the intrinsic rate of natural increase were <. 1.8 and 0.4. μg/L, respectively. Our study raises questions about prodrug and active metabolites in environmental toxicology assessments of pharmaceuticals. Our findings also emphasize the importance of performing long-term experiments and considering multi-endpoints instead of the standard reproduction outcome. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Chronic effect; Ecotoxicology; Measured concentration; Prodrug; Tamoxifen metabolite; Two-generational study","Ahmad, A., Shahabuddin, S., Sheikh, S., Kale, P., Krishnappa, M., Rane, R.C., Ahmad, I., Endoxifen, a new cornerstone of breast cancer therapy: demonstration of safety, tolerability, and systemic bioavailability in healthy human subjects (2010) Clin.

In the present study we have investigated the antiproliferative activity of methanolic extract of A. californica and its fractions in cancer cell lines and phytochemical analysis and mechanism of apoptosis of the fractions with antiproliferative activity. The antiproliferative activity of methanol extract and its fractions of solvents were evaluated by MTT assay against the M12.Ak.C3.F6, RAW 264.7, HeLa and L929 cell lines. Active fractions were fractionated by molecular exclusion chromatography, HPLC and MPLC. The identification of compounds was performed by NMR and FIA-ESI-IT-MS/MS analysis. Apoptotic mechanism was analyzed by flow cytometry, determining the reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential (JC-1) and the activity of caspases 3, 8 and 9. Cell viability assays showed that the hexane fraction of the methanol extract of the plant has significant effects against cancer lines RAW 264.7 (IC50=52.08±1.06μg/mL) and HeLa (IC50=46.77±1.09μg/mL), the residual fraction showed a selective effect on cell lines M12.Ak.C3.F6 (IC50=59.90±1.05μg/mL), RAW 264.7 (IC50=58.93±1.26μg/mL) and HeLa (IC50=50.11±1.135μg/mL) compared to the control cell line L929 (IC50=100.00±1.09μg/mL). The chemical characterization of the active fractions allowed the identification of β-sitosterol and stigmasterol in hexane fraction and some phenolic acids, proanthocyanidins and flavonoids in the residual fraction. The methanol extract and hexane fraction reduces mitochondrial membrane potential significantly and activates caspases 3, 8 and 9. Because of the antiproliferative activity observed, our results provide a rational basis for the use of extracts of A. californica in treating various types of cancer in traditional medicine from Mexico. The extracts induce apoptosis via activation of caspases. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Antiproliferative activity; Apoptotic mechanism; Chemical composition","Alarcón, A., Román, R., Pérez, S., Aguilar, A., Contreras, C., Flores, J., Study of the anti-hyperglycemic effect of plants used as antidiabetics (1998) J.

In adult life, it is a tightly regulated process but in several pathological conditions, angiogenesis results abnormal with either excessive or insufficient proliferation of blood vessels. The pro-angiogenic members of VEGF family, VEGF-A, VEGF-B and placental growth factor (PlGF), and the related receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, have a central and decisive role in pathological angiogenesis. Indeed, they are the targets for anti-angiogenic drugs currently approved: bevacizumab and ranibizumab, that specifically inhibit VEGF-A; aflibercept, that is able to prevent the activity of VEGF-A, VEGF-B and PlGF; several multirtarget tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are able to prevent VEGFR-1 and/or VEGFR-2 signaling. The anti-angiogenesis therapy has represented one of the most active fields of drug discovery of last decade and promises to be further expanded due the wide number of diseases for which it may by applied. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Elevated Bmi-1 expression is observed in skin cancer and contributes to cancer cell survival. (-) Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), an important green tea-derived cancer prevention agent, reduces Bmi-1 level resulting in reduced skin cancer cell survival. This is associated with increased p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 expression, reduced cyclin, and cyclin dependent kinase expression, and increased cleavage of apoptotic markers. These EGCG-dependent changes are attenuated by vector-mediated maintenance of Bmi-1 expression. In the present study, we identify Bmi-1 functional domains that are required for this response. Bmi-1 expression reverses the EGCG-dependent reduction in SCC-13 cell survival, but Bmi-1 mutants lacking the helix-turn-helix-turn-helix-turn (Bmi-1δHT) or ring finger (Bmi-1δRF) domains do not reverse the EGCG impact. The reduction in Ring1B ubiquitin ligase activity, observed in the presence of mutant Bmi-1, is associated with reduced ability of these mutants to interact with and activate Ring1B ubiquitin ligase, the major ligase responsible for the ubiquitination of histone H2A during chromatin condensation. This results in less chromatin condensation leading to increased tumor suppressor gene expression and reduced cell survival; thereby making the cells more susceptible to the anti-survival action of EGCG. We further show that these mutants act in a dominant-negative manner to inhibit the action of endogenous Bmi-1. Our results suggest that the HT and RF domains are required for Bmi-1 ability to maintain skin cancer cell survival in response to cancer preventive agents. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Chemoprevention; EGCG; Ezh2; Histone methylation; Polycomb group proteins; Skin cancer","Balasubramanian, S., Lee, K., Adhikary, G., Gopalakrishnan, R., Rorke, E.A., Eckert, R.L., (2008) Nutr.

They are rich in histidine, which suggests that their activity might be pH-dependent. We examined their structure-function relationships with a view to learning how to improve AMP therapeutic ratios. Activity assays with Gram-negative bacteria and cancer cell lines demonstrate that Gad-2 is substantially more active at slightly acidic pH than it is at neutral pH. By contrast, the activity of Gad-1 at lower pH is similar to its activity at pH 7. Circular dichroism spectra indicate that the greater functional plasticity of Gad-2 correlates with a greater structural plasticity; Gad-2's percent helicity varies dramatically with altered pH and lipid environment. Interestingly, Gad-2's highest levels of helicity do not correspond to the conditions where it is most active. High resolution solution NMR structures were determined in SDS micelles at pH 5, conditions that induce an intermediate level of helicity in the peptides. Gad-1 is more helical than Gad-2, with both peptides exhibiting the greatest helical tendencies in their central region and lowest helicity in their N-termini. The high resolution structures suggest that maximum activity relies on the appropriate balance between an N-terminal region with mixed hydrophobic/hydrophilic structure features and an amphipathic central and C-terminal region. Taken together with previous studies, our results suggest that to improve the therapeutic ratio of AMPs, consideration should be given to including sequential histidine-pairs, keeping the overall charge of the peptide modest, and retaining a degree of structural plasticity and imperfect amphipathicity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

For example, mouse target tissue absorption per unit dose is an estimated 10-fold lower at the CrVI dose corresponding to the federal maximum contaminant level (MCL) than at the USEPA draft oral slope factor (SFo) point of departure dose. This decreasing target tissue absorption as doses decrease to lower, more environmentally-relevant doses is inconsistent with linear low-dose extrapolation. The shape of the dose-response curve accounting for this toxicokinetic phenomenon would clearly be non-linear. Furthermore, these dose-dependent differences in absorption indicate that the magnitude of risk overestimation by a linear low-dose extrapolation approach (e.g., SFo) increases and is likely to span one or perhaps more orders of magnitude as it is used to predict risk at progressively lower, more environmentally-relevant doses. An additional apparent implication is that no single SFo can reliably predict risk across potential environmental doses (e.g., doses corresponding to water concentrations. ≤. the federal MCL). A non-linear approach, consistent with available mode of action data, is most scientifically defensible for derivation of an oral toxicity factor for CrVI-induced carcinogenesis. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..","Cancer; Carcinogenicity; Chromium; Hexavalent; Oral exposure; Regulatory; Toxicity","(2010) Chromium-6 in US Tap Water, , http://static.ewg.org/reports/2010/chrome6/chrome6_report_2.pdf, Environmental Working Group, December 20, 2010; Haney, J., Use of dose-dependent absorption into target tissues to more accurately predict cancer risk at low oral doses of hexavalent chromium (2015) Regul.

Elevated expression of HEF1 promotes invasion and metastasis in multiple cancer cell types. To date, little is known on its role in CRC tumor progression. HEF1 is phosphorylated on several Ser/Thr residues but the effects of these post-translational modifications on the functions of HEF1 are poorly understood. In this manuscript, we investigated the role of HEF1 in migration of colorectal adeno-carcinoma cells. First, we showed that overexpression of HEF1 in colo-carcinoma cell line HCT116 increases cell migration. Moreover, in these cells, HEF1 increases Src-mediated phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-861 and 925. We then showed that HEF1 mutation on Ser-369 enhances HEF1-induced migration and FAK phosphorylation as a result of protein stabilization. We also, for the first time characterized a functional mutation of HEF1 on Arg-367 which mimics the effect of Ser-369 to Ala mutation. Finally through mass spectrometry experiments, we identified BCAR3 as an essential interactor and mediator of HEF1-induced migration. We demonstrated that single amino acid mutations that prevent formation of the HEF1-BCAR3 complex impair HEF1-mediated migration. Therefore, amino-acid substitutions that impede Ser-369 phosphorylation stabilize HEF1 which increases the migration of CRC cells and this latter effect requires the interaction of HEF1 with the NSP family adaptor protein BCAR3. Collectively, these data reveal the importance of HEF1 expression level in cancer cell motility and then support the utilization of HEF1 as a biomarker of tumor progression. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","BCAR3;

The FA-GNA-MNPs have been prepared by a facile method, which have been further characterized by SEM, TEM, IR and UV-vis spectra. And the cytotoxicity of FA-GNA-MNPs to HeLa and A549 cells was assessed using the MTT assay. The FA-GNA-MNPs (with loading efficiency of 4.35%) showed sustained liberation of GNA molecules (with 73.46% release in 96 h). The mean particle diameter (MD) of FA-GNA-MNPs and the polydispersity index (PDI) are 254.3 nm and 0.139, respectively. The cytotoxicity of free GNA and FA-GNA-MNPs toward HeLa cells showed that FA-GNA-MNPs was more cytotoxic than GNA. Based on these findings, it suggests that FA-GNA-MNPs would be as a novel multifunctional nanomedicine/theranostic for concurrent targeting, imaging and therapy of the FR-positive cancer cells.

COPP effectively (72%) inhibited invasion and metastasis in experimental animals. In vivo results were substantiated by modulation of cancer specific markers such as galectin-3, which is a key molecule for initiation of metastatic cascade, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that enhances angiogenesis, matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 that are required for invasion, NF-κB, a transcription factor for proliferative potency of tumor cells and a phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI), the activity of which favors cancer cell growth. Structural characterization studies indicate the active component (relatively less acidic, 0.05 M ammonium carbonate, 160 kDa fraction) which showed antimetastatic potency in vitro with MIC of 0.09 μg/mL, and ∼45 fold increase in the activity when compared to that of COPP. Gas liquid chromatographic analysis indicated the presence of rhamnose (1%), arabinose (20%), xylose (3%), mannose (4%), galactose (54%) and uronic acid (10%) in different proportions. However, correlative data attributed galectin-3 inhibitory activity to enhanced levels of arabinose and galactose. FTIR, HPLC and NMR spectroscopic analysis further highlights that COPP is an arabinogalactan with methyl/ethyl esters. It is therefore suggested that the blockade of galectin-3 mediated lung metastasis appears to be a result of an inhibition of mixed functions induced during metastasis. The data signifies the importance of dietary carbohydrate as cancer-preventive agent. Although pectin digestibility and absorption are issues of concern, promising in vivo data provides evidence for the cancer preventive property of corn. The present study reveals for the first time a new component of corn, i.e., - corn pectin with cancer preventive activity apart from corn starch that has been in wide use for multipurpose health benefits. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Corn pectic polysaccharide; Matrix metalloproteinases; Phosphoglucoisomerase; Serum glutamate oxaloacetate; serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase; transaminase","Roodman, G.D., Mechanisms of bone metastasis (2004) N.

Overexpression of drug efflux transporters like P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and resistance to apoptosis are the two key factors that confer cancer drug resistance. Gambogic acid (GA), a major component of Gamboge resin, has potent anticancer effects and can inhibit the growth of several types of human cancers. However, the potential and underlying mechanisms of GA in reversing cancer resistance remain poorly understood. In the present study, we found that GA can markedly sensitize doxorubicin (DOX)-resistant breast cancer cells to DOX-mediated cell death. GA increased the intracellular accumulation of DOX by inhibiting both P-gp expression and activity. Meanwhile, the combination effect was associated with the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the suppression of anti-apoptotic protein survivin. Scavenging intracellular ROS or overexpression of survivin blocked the sensitizing effects of GA in DOX-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, ROS-mediated activation of p38 MAPK was revealed in GA-mediated suppression of survivin expression. This study gives rise to the possibility of applying GA as an anticancer agent for the purpose of combating DOX-resistant breast cancer. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, there are no reports describing its effects on the invasion and metastasis of hepatoma cell lines, and the detailed molecular mechanisms of its effects are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying naringenin-mediated inhibition of 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced cell invasion and inhibition of secreted and cytosolic MMP-9 production in human hepatoma cells (HepG2, Huh-7, and HA22T) and murine embryonic liver cells (BNL CL2). Naringenin suppressed MMP-9 transcription by inhibiting activator protein (AP)-1 and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity. It suppressed TPA-induced AP-1 activity through inhibiting the phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways, and it suppressed TPA-induced inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation through IκB. Additionally, it suppressed TPA-induced activation of ERK/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt upstream of NF-κB and AP-1. These data suggest that naringenin suppresses the invasiveness and metastatic potential of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by inhibiting multiple signal transduction pathways. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Their internalization by Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) breast cancer cells was also investigated. Methods: Nanoparticles were prepared by a multiple emulsion solvent evaporation method. Then the following studies were carried out: drug-excipients interaction using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), surface morphology by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), zeta potential and size distribution using a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 and particle size analyzer, and in vitro drug release. In vitro cellular uptake of nanoparticles was assessed by confocal microscopy and their cell viability (%) was studied. Results: No chemical interaction was observed between the drug and the selected excipients. TNPs had a smooth surface, and a nanosize range (250-380 nm) with a negative surface charge. Drug loadings of the prepared particles were 1.5%±0.02% weight/weight (w/w), 2.68%±0.5% w/w, 4.09%±0.2% w/w, 27.16%±2.08% w/w for NP1-NP4, respectively. A sustained drug release pattern from the nanoparticles was observed for the entire period of study, ie, up to 60 days. Further, nanoparticles were internalized well by the MCF-7 breast cancer cells on a concentration dependent manner and were present in the cytoplasm. The nucleus was free from nanoparticle entry. Drug loaded nanoparticles were found to be more cytotoxic than the free drug. Conclusion: TNPs (NP4) showed the highest drug loading, released the drug in a sustained manner for a prolonged period of time and were taken up well by the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line in vitro. Thus the formulation may be suitable for breast cancer treatment due to the good permeation of the formulation into the breast cancer cells. © 2014 Maji et al.","Breast cancer; Multiple emulsion; PLGA; Polylactide-co-glycolide nanoparticle","Malik, A.A., Wani, K.A., Ahmad, S.R., Breast conservative therapy (2012) J Med Sci, 15 (1), pp. 7-14; Sinha, R., Kim, G.J., Nie, S., Shin, D.M., Nanotechnology in cancer therapeutics: Bioconjugated nanoparticles for drug delivery (2006) Mol Cancer Ther, 5 (8), pp. 1909-1917; Danhier, F., Ansorena, E., Silva, J.M., Coco, R., Le Breton, A., Préat, V., PLGA-based nanoparticles: An overview of biomedical applications (2012) J Control Release, 161 (2), pp. 505-522; Lü, J.M., Wang, X., Marin-Muller, C., Current advances in research and clinical applications of PLGA-based nanotechnology (2009) Expert Rev Mol Diagn, 9 (4), pp. 325-341; Kumari, A., Yadav, S.K., Yadav, S.C., Biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles based drug delivery systems (2010) Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces, 75 (1), pp. 1-18; Prokop, A., Davidson, J.M., Nanovehicular intracellular delivery systems (2008) J Pharm Sci, 97 (9), pp. 3518-3590; Averineni, R.K., Shavi, G.V., Gurram, A.K., PLGA 50:50 nanoparticles of paclitaxel: Development, in vitro anti-tumor activity in BT-549 cells and in vivo evaluation (2012) Bull Mater Sci, 35 (3), pp. 319-326; Hassani, S.M., Bagheri, S., Computational procedure for determining physicochemical properties of doxorubicin-PLGA nanoparticles and daunorubicin-PLGA nanoparticles (2012) Int J Pharm Tech Res, 4 (3), pp. 1242-1246; Pradhan, R., Poudel, B.K., Ramasamy, T., Choi, H.G., Yong, C.S., Kim, J.O., Docetaxel-loaded polylactic acid-co-glycolic acid nanoparticles: Formulation, physicochemical characterization and cytotoxicity studies (2013) J Nanosci Nanotechnol, 13 (8), pp. 5948-5956; Wohlfart, S., Khalansky, A.S., Gelperina, S., Efficient chemotherapy of rat glioblastoma using doxorubicin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles with different stabilizers (2011) PLoS One, 6 (5), pp. e19121; Letrozole therapy alone or in sequence with tamoxifen in women with breast cancer (2009) N Engl J Med, 361 (8), pp. 766-776. , The BIG 1-98 Collaborative Group; Peters-Engl, C., Frank, W., Danmayr, E., Friedl, H.P., Leodolter, S., Medl, M., Association between endometrial cancer and tamoxifen treatment of breast cancer (1999) Breast Cancer Res Treat, 54 (3), pp. 255-260; de Lima, G.R., Facina, G., Shida, J.Y., Effects of low dose tamoxifen on normal breast tissue from premenopausal women (2003) Eur J Cancer, 39 (7), pp. 891-898; Mirzajani, F., Rafati, H., Atyabi, F., Fabrication of biodegradable poly (d, l-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles containing tamoxifen citrate (2010) Iranian Polymer Journal, 19 (6), pp. 437-446; Lamprecht, A., Ubrich, N., Hombreiro Pérez, M., Lehr, C.M., Hoffman, M., Maincent, P., Biodegradable monodispersed nanoparticles prepared by pressure homogenization-emulsification (1999) Int J Pharm, 184 (1), pp. 97-105; Ueda, M., Kreuter, J., Optimization of the preparation of loperamide-loaded poly (L-lactide) nanoparticles by high pressure emulsification-solvent evaporation (1997) J Microencapsul, 14 (5), pp. 593-605; Sinha, B., Mukherjee, B., Pattnaik, G., Poly-lactide-co-glycolide nanoparticles containing voriconazole for pulmonary delivery: In vitro and in vivo study (2013) Nanomedicine, 9 (1), pp. 94-104; Li, X., Tian, X., Zhang, J., In vitro and in vivo evaluation of folate receptor-targeting amphiphilic copolymer-modified liposomes loaded with docetaxel (2011) Int J Nanomedicine, 6, pp. 1167-1184; Fonseca, C., Simõesa, S., Gaspar, R., Paclitaxel-loaded PLGA nanoparticles: Preparation, physicochemical characterization and in vitro anti-tumoral activity (2002) J Control Release, 83 (2), pp. 273-286; Rudra, A., Manasadeepa, R., Ghosh, M.K., Ghosh, S., Mukherjee, B., Doxorubicin-loaded phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated nanoliposomes: In vitro characterization and their accumulation in liver, kidneys, and lungs in rats (2010) Int J Nanomedicine, 5, pp. 811-823; Beckett, A.H., Stenlake, J.B., Infrared spectrophotometry (1997) Practical Pharmaceutical Chemistry, pp. 384-390. , 4th ed.

In our present work, a new series of curcumin derivatives were designed and synthesized using curcumin as model. Here, we evaluated whether curcumin derivatives have better efficiency to degrade HER2 than curcumin. Among these test compounds, pculin02H had better efficiency to inhibit the expression of HER2 than curcumin. Moreover, pculin02H preferentially suppressed the growth of HER2-overexpressing cancer cell lines. Pculin02H induced G2/M cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. Interestingly, our results suggested that a posttranslational mechanism contributed to pculin02H-induced HER2 depletion in HER2-overexpressing cancer cells. We found that pculin02H significantly enhanced the antitumor efficacy of clinical drugs on HER2-overexpressing cancer cells as well as efficiently reduced HER2-induced drug resistance. These findings may provide an alternative preventive or therapeutic strategy against HER2-overexpressing cancer cells. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Apoptosis; G2/M arrest; HER2; Pculin02H","Basmadjian, C., Zhao, Q., Bentouhami, E., Djehal, A., Nebigil, C.G., Johnson, R.A., Serova, M., Désaubry, L.G., Cancer wars: Natural products strike back (2014) Front.

Aim of the study The present study aimed to investigate the growth inhibitory effect of Trillium tschonoskii steroidal saponins in a mouse model of colitis-associated colorectal cancer and a human colorectal cancer cell line HT-29, and isolate some major constituents and evaluate their anti-tumor activity. Materials and methods Forty male ICR mice were administered with 1, 2-dimethyl-hydrazine (DMH) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Ten mice were given no further treatment, the rest were administered with different doses of TTS (5, 10, 20 mg/kg) orally, every three days from the 9th week to the 20th week. Results TTS effectively protected ICR mice against DMH/DSS-induced tumorigenesis. The incidence of tumor development was 90% (9/10) in the mice treated with DMH/DSS, but that was reduced to 50% (5/10), 40% (4/10), and 20% (2/10), respectively, in the mice treated with 5%, 10%, and 20% of TTS. Results of Ki-67 staining, TUNEL assay and caspase-3 activity assay revealed that TTS moderately decreased abnormal proliferation and increased apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells. It inhibited the growth and triggered the apoptosis of HT-29 cells, partly through suppressing mitogen-actived protein kinases (MAPKs) and triggering mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway. Three compounds, namely, Paris saponin VII, polyphylloside III and Paris saponin VI, were important active compounds in TTS. Conclusion These data suggest that TTS has a potential role in clinical prevention and treatment for colorectal cancer. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The current study was aimed to document medicinal flora and its therapeutic actions along with the relative importance in local health care system of the district of Vehari, Punjab province, Pakistan. Materials and method Rapid appraisal approach (RAA) and semi structured interviews were used along with the group meetings with herbalists, local inhabitants and landowners to collect the relevant data. Results and discussions A total 77 medicinal plants belonging to 41 families disseminated among 71 genera were reported. Fabaceae was the predominant family over others with 9 reported medicinal plant species. Use frequency of leaves was at peak with 30.12% followed by stem 24.62%, fruit 14.22%, flower 12.97%, seeds 12.13%, bark 4.6% and pod 1.25%, in herbal preparations. Allium cepa exhibited the highest use value (0.90) while lowest use value (UV) was reflected by Aerva javanica (0.10). Documentation of various medicinal plants for the treatment of cancer, hepatitis and cardiac disorders is evidence in favor to highlight the value of medicinal flora. Conclusions Unfortunately, no attention has been paid to this treasure in term of conservation and utilization in modern healthcare system, where these plants can be a best replacement of chemically synthesized drugs. It is also recommended that plants exhibiting high UV should be screened for detailed bio-active phytochemicals. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This study prepared methyl poly(ethylene glycol)-distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine/doxorubicin (MPEG-DSPE/DOX) micelle for the treatment of lymph node metastasis. The MPEG-DSPE/DOX micelle prepared were of spherical morphology with a particle size of 20 ± 5 nm. The uptake rates of DOX and MPEG-DSPE/DOX micelle by A375 cells were 51.2% and 88.7%, respectively. The phagocytosis rate of MPEG-DSPE/Rhodamine B micelle by RAW264.7 cells was 17.2-fold lower than for Rhodamine B alone. After subcutaneous injection, MPEG-DSPE micelle underwent lymphatic absorption and accumulated in popliteal lymph nodes. MPEG-DSPE/DOX micelle significantly alleviated damage to the subcutaneous tissue of the injection sites compared with DOX alone. We established a model of nude mice bearing lymph node metastasis of A375 cells. After subcutaneous injection, the weights of both the popliteal and iliac lymph nodes of the MPEG-DSPE/DOX micelle group were significantly lower than in the saline and DOX groups. MPEG-DSPE/DOX micelle effectively killed the tumor cells in popliteal and iliac lymph nodes.

The studied copolymers were characterized by 1H NMR, SEM, and FTIR spectroscopy. Morphological investigations showed that both blank and drug-loaded nanogels had uniform shapes with a mean diameter of less than 30 nm. The drug storage/release behaviors were investigated. The nanogels showed an encapsulation efficiency of about 95% for both drugs. The cumulative in vitro release of the DOX/MTX-loaded nanogels exhibited an apparent thermo/pH-triggered controlled drug release in a sustained manner that was able to distinguish between tumor tissues. The cytotoxicity assay of a blank carrier to MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines indicated that the nanogels were suitable as drug carriers. Cell viability experiments further confirmed that the co-administration of DOX with MTX had a superior cytotoxicity to the mentioned cells compared with free dual drug- or single drug-loaded forms. Therefore, dual anticancer drug-loaded thermo/pH-sensitive nanogels have the potential to be used for cancer therapy, because they maintain a low premature drug release during blood circulation while having a rapid release upon reaching tumorous tissue. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The nanoparticles are made of a tri-block copolymer, poly(d,l lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)-b-poly(l-histidine) (PHis)-b-polyethylene glycol (PEG), via nano-precipitation. To provide the nanoparticle feature of endolysosomal escape and pH sensitivity, poly(l-histidine) was chosen as a proton sponge polymer. Herceptin, which specifically binds to HER2 antigen, was conjugated to the nanoparticles through click chemistry. The nanoparticles were characterized via dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both methods showed the sizes of about 100 nm with a uniform size distribution. The pH sensitivity was assessed by drug releases and size changes at different pH conditions. As pH decreased from 7.4 to 5.2, the drug release rate accelerated and the size significantly increased. During in vitro tests against human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 showed significantly increased uptake for Herceptin-conjugated nanoparticles, as compared to non-targeted nanoparticles. Herceptin-conjugated pH-sensitive nanoparticles showed the highest therapeutic effect, and thus validated the efficacy of a combined approach of pH sensitivity and active targeting. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

DC belonging to the family Rutaceae has been traditionally used for the treatment of rheumatism, anaemia, jaundice, skin diseases, bronchitis etc. The plant is traditionally considered as anti-cancer medicine and used by the healers of Bangladesh to treat all types of cancers. Perhaps the key to many of its medicinal applications is its inherent anti-inflammatory property. Aim of the study The present study is aimed at evaluating the effect of various fractions of G. pentaphylla (Retz.) DC leaves on the cell cycle and apoptosis of breast cancer cells viz. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Materials and methods Various extracts and fractions of the leaves of G. pentaphylla (Retz.) DC were studied for their cytotoxicity with the help of Sulforhodamine B assay, in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and Vero cell lines. The most active fractions were studied for their effect on the cell cycle of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Apoptotic studies were done using Hoechst staining, DNA fragmentation, Annexin V staining and caspase-3/7 activation assay in breast cancer cells. HPLC and HPTLC profiling of the active fractions were done. Results HPTLC and HPLC profiling revealed the presence of lupeol, chrysin, quercetin, β-sitosterol and kaempferol as components in active fractions. Lupeol and chrysin are being reported in this plant for the first time. The studies showed that the selected fractions possess cell cycle inhibitory and apoptosis inducing effect on both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Apoptotic effect of the fractions on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells may be through the mitochondrial pathway by the activation of caspase-3/7. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Annexin V staining; Apoptosis; Caspase-3/7 activation; Cell cyclearrest; Glycosmis pentaphylla (Retz.)DC; HPLC","Ahmad, B., Khan, M.R., Shah, N.A., Khan, R.A., In vitro antioxidant potential of Dicliptera roxburghiana (2013) BMC Complement.

However, new approaches are encouraged in developing new nanomedicines against malignant cells. In this work, a reproducible methodology is described to prepare Δ9-tetrahidrocannabinol (Δ9-THC)-loaded poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles against lung cancer. The nanoformulation is further improved by surface functionalization with the biodegradable polymers chitosan and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) in order to optimize the biological fate and antitumor effect. Mean nanoparticle size (≈290 nm) increased upon coating with PEG, CS, and PEG-CS up to ≈590 nm, ≈745 nm, and ≈790 nm, respectively. Surface electrical charge was controlled by the type of polymeric coating onto the PLGA particles. Drug entrapment efficiencies (≈95%) were not affected by any of the polymeric coatings. On the opposite, the characteristic sustained (biphasic) Δ9-THC release from the particles can be accelerated or slowed down when using PEG or chitosan, respectively. Blood compatibility studies demonstrated the adequate in vivo safety margin of all of the PLGA-based nanoformulations, while protein adsorption investigations postulated the protective role of PEGylation against opsonization and plasma clearance. Cell viability studies comparing the activity of the nanoformulations against human A-549 and murine LL2 lung adenocarcinoma cells, and human embryo lung fibroblastic MRC-5 cells revealed a statistically significant selective cytotoxic effect toward the lung cancer cell lines. In addition, cytotoxicity assays in A-549 cells demonstrated the more intense anticancer activity of Δ9-THC-loaded PEGylated PLGA nanoparticles. These promising results were confirmed by in vivo studies in LL2 lung tumor-bearing immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Blood compatibility; Chitosan; Lung cancer; Nanoparticles; PEGylation; PLGA; Δ9-Tetrahidrocannabinol","Arias, J.L., López-Viota, M., Sáez-Fernández, E., Ruiz, M.A., Delgado, A.V., Engineering of an antitumor (core/shell) magnetic nanoformulation based on the chemotherapy agent ftorafur (2011) Colloids Surf.

Isolation and characterization of adjuvant saponins is very tedious. Furthermore, standardization of Quillaja saponins is critical pertaining to its application in humans. In this study, a convenient method based on agarose gel electrophoresis was developed for the separation of Quillaja saponins. Six different commercial Quillaja saponins were segregated by size/charge into numerous fractions. Each of the fractions was characterized by ESI-TOF-MS spectroscopy and thin layer chromatography. Real-time impedance-based monitoring and red blood cell lysis assay were used to evaluate cytotoxicity and hemolytic activities respectively. Two specific regions in the agarose gel (delimited by specific relative electrophoretic mobility values) were identified and characterized by exclusive migration of acylated saponins known to possess immune adjuvant properties (0.18-0.58), and cytotoxic and hemolytic saponins (0.18-0.94). In vivo experiments in mice with the isolated fractions for evaluation of adjuvant activity also correlated with the relative electrophoretic mobility. In addition to the separation of specific Quillaja saponins with adjuvant effects as a pre-purification step to HPLC, agarose gel electrophoresis stands out as a new method for rapid screening, separation and quality control of saponins. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
