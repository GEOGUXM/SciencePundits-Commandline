Specifically, the model tested whether PCE was associated with self-regulation either directly or indirectly via high maternal harshness and poor language development. The role of child sex, autonomic reactivity, and cumulative environmental risk as potential moderators was also explored. The sample was 216 mother-child dyads recruited at birth and assessed at 2, 7, 13, 24, 36, and 48. months of child ages. Participating mothers were primarily African American (72%). Results indicated a significant indirect association between PCE and child effortful control at 36. months via higher maternal harshness. Autonomic reactivity moderated the association between maternal harshness and self-regulation such that among children with poor autonomic reactivity, high maternal harshness was associated with lower conscience at 3. years. Child sex and environmental risk did not moderate the association between PCE and self-regulation. Thus, the quality of caregiving experience played a significant role in the development of self-regulation among PCE children, especially those at higher autonomic risk. In particular, PCE children who also exhibit poor autonomic reactivity may be particularly susceptible to environmental influences such as parenting. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Autonomic; Conscience; Effortful control; Harsh parenting; Language development; Prenatal substance exposure; Self-regulation","Allan, N.P., Lonigan, C.J., Examining the dimensionality of effortful control in preschool children and its relation to academic and socioemotional indicators (2011) Developmental Psychology, 47, pp. 905-915; Arbuckle, J.L., Full information estimation in the presence of incomplete data (1996) Advanced structural equation modeling: Issues and techniques, pp. 243-277. , Lawrence Erlbaum, Mahwah, NJ, G.A.

Parental control behaviours have been assumed to be exogenous to the child, but emerging evidence suggests they are also child-responsive. This study tests the hypothesis that parental control in early infancy is responsive to infant appetite and weight. Subjects and methods: Participants were 1920 mothers from the Gemini twin cohort, using one randomly selected child per family. Data come from questionnaires completed when the children were approximately 8 months. Mothers completed measures of 'pressure' and 'restriction', reported feeding method (breast- and bottle feeding), rated their infant's appetite during the first 3 months, provided health professional recorded weight measurements, and reported their concerns about their infant's weight. Logistic regression examined predictors of 'pressure' and 'restriction', adjusting for maternal demographics and BMI. Interactions between feeding method and control were also tested. Results: 'Pressure' was associated with lower birth weight (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.65-0.97), greater concern about underweight (OR = 1.88, 1.29-2.75), and lower infant appetite (OR = 0.59, 0.47-0.75). 'Restriction' was associated with higher appetite (OR = 1.44, 1.09-1.89) and bottle feeding (OR = 2.86, 2.18-3.75). A significant interaction with feeding method indicated that infants with high appetites were more likely to be restricted only if they were bottle-fed (OR = 1.52, 1.13-2.04). Conclusion: Mothers vary in their levels of control over milk-feeding and this is partly responsive to the infant's characteristics. They tend to pressure infants who are lighter and have a smaller appetite, and restrict infants with larger appetites if they are bottle-fed. Guidance on infant feeding may be better received if it acknowledges that parents respond to infant characteristics in order to achieve their feeding goals. © 2015 The Authors.","Feeding; Infants; Parental control; Pressure; Restriction; Weight","Baird, J., Fisher, D., Lucas, P., Kleijnen, J., Roberts, H., Law, C., Being big or growing fast.

Although new parents are frequently affected by depressive symptoms, little is known about prevalence, risk, and predictors of parental postpartum depression (PPD) following VLBW birth. Furthermore, most studies assessing PPD in parents of preterm children relied on self-report only. Methods As part of the HaFEn cohort-study, data from the index groups of parents with VLBW infants and the control group of parents with term infants were cross-sectionally analysed. Families were recruited at the three largest centres of perinatal medical care in Hamburg, Germany. PPD was evaluated one month postpartum using standardized questionnaires and clinical interviews. Socioeconomic status, social support, risks during pregnancy, and psychiatric lifetime diagnoses were also assessed. A multiple random coefficient model was used to examine predictors of PPD in both parents simultaneously. Results 230 mothers and 173 fathers were included. Depending on the measure, the risk of being postnatally depressed was 4 to 18 times higher in mothers and 3 to 9 times higher in fathers from the index group. The most relevant risk factor for PPD was the birth of a VLBW infant, followed by female sex, lifetime psychiatric disorder, and low social support. Limitations Results presented here, are based on cross sectional data. Therefore no temporal relationships can be established. Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of early screening for PPD in both parents of VLBW infants. Factors contributing to developing depression should also be considered in neonatal care. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Maternal/paternal; Postpartum depression; Preterm birth; Risk factors","Affleck, G., Tennen, H., Rowe, J., (1991) Infants in Crisis: How Parents Cope with Newborn Intensive Care and Its Aftermath, , Springer-Verlag New York, NY; Alkozei, A., McMahon, E., Lahav, A., Stress levels and depressive symptoms in NICU mothers in the early postpartum period (2014) J.

Here we studied cortical thickness in very preterm born individuals and controls in mid-adolescence (mean age 15. years) and beginning of adulthood (mean age 20. years), as well as longitudinal changes between the two time points. Using univariate approaches, we showed both increases and decreases in cortical thickness in very preterm born individuals compared to controls. Specifically (1) very preterm born adolescents displayed extensive areas of greater cortical thickness, especially in occipitotemporal and prefrontal cortices, differences which decreased substantially by early adulthood; (2) at both time points, very preterm-born participants showed smaller cortical thickness, especially in parahippocampal and insular regions. We then employed a multivariate approach (support vector machine) to study spatially discriminating features between the two groups, which achieved a mean accuracy of 86.5%. The spatially distributed regions in which cortical thickness best discriminated between the groups (top 5%) included temporal, occipitotemporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices. Within these spatially distributed regions (top 1%), longitudinal changes in cortical thickness in left temporal pole, right occipitotemporal gyrus and left superior parietal lobe were significantly associated with scores on language-based tests of executive function. These results describe alterations in cortical thickness development in preterm-born individuals in their second decade of life, with implications for high-order cognitive processing. © 2015 .","Cortical thickness; MRI; Neuropsychological outcome; Preterm; Support vector machine","Aanes, S., Bjuland, K.J., Skranes, J., Lohaugen, G.C., Memory function and hippocampal volumes in preterm born very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) young adults (2015) NeuroImage, 105, pp. 76-83; Ad-Dab'bagh, Y., Einarson, D., Lyttelton, O., Muehlboeck, J., Mok, K., Ivanov, O., Vincent, R.D., Evans, A.C., The CIVET image-processing environment: a fully automated comprehensive pipeline for anatomical neuroimaging research (2006) Proceedings of the 12th Annual Meeting of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping, Florence; Ardila, A., Bernal, B., Rosselli, M., Language and visual perception associations: meta-analytic connectivity modeling of Brodmann area 37 (2015) Behav.

The objectives of this study were to investigate whether paraoxonase-2 (PON2) Ala148Gly (A148G) polymorphisms have impacts on fetal growth, and evaluate potential modifying effect on the association between phthalate exposures and LBW and short birth length. Methods: In the current case-control study, 185 mother-newborn pairs including 74 low birth weight (LBW) cases and 111 controls were enrolled. Newborns' meconium specimens were collected and detected for mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP) and mono-2-ethyhexyl phthalate (MEHP) by the method of high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Umbilical vein blood samples were used to identify PON2 A148G polymorphisms by using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Results: Newborns prenatally exposed to higher level of phthalates had lower birth weight (. β=-0.92. p=0.045 for MBP, β=-0.62, p=0.013 for MEHP) and short birth length (SBL) (. β=-0.024. p=0.049 for MBP, β=-0.023, p=0.007 for MEHP). Comparing with low-phthalate-exposed subjects with PON2 148AA genotype, newborns with PON2 148AG/GG genotype exposed to high concentrations of MBP and MEHP had higher risks of LBW and short birth length (LBW: OR: 5.0, p=0.017 for MEHP; OR: 2.6, p=0.023 for MBP; SBL: OR: 6.6, p=0.005 for MEHP; OR: 6.4, p=0.017 for MBP). Effects of MBP and MEHP on LBW were significantly modified by PON2 A148G (. p=0.044 and 0.034, respectively), while the modifying effect of PON2 A148G polymorphisms on the association of two phthalate metabolites with SBL was not significant. Conclusion: Prenatal exposure to phthalates affected birth weight and length in newborns. PON2 A148G polymorphisms modified the effects of prenatal phthalates' exposure on fetal development. Newborns with PON2 148AG/GG genotype and exposed to high concentrations of MBP and MEHP had higher risks of LBW and SBL. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Birth length; Low birth weight; Modifying effect; Phthalates; PON2 A148G polymorphism","Al-Gubory, K.H., Fowler, P.A., Garrel, C., The roles of cellular reactive oxygen species, oxidative stress and antioxidants in pregnancy outcomes (2010) Int.

These environmental contaminants may have detrimental effects on human health, particularly during development. Due to the ability to transmit contaminants to the fetus, evaluating the effects of exposure of pregnant women on the psychomotor development of their offspring is of particular interest. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of exposure of female rats to an urban soil influenced by the dispersion of air contaminants during periods of pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and lactation on offspring development. Using physiological, behavioral and hematological parameters, deleterious effects on offspring were assessed. In behavioral parameters, parental exposure during pregnancy and lactation resulted in no significant differences in the evaluated parameters when compared to the control group. In contrast, pups from the pre-pregnancy group displayed decreased locomotor and exploratory activity in addition to increased levels of anxiety. Furthermore, offspring of rats exposed to contaminated urban soil during pre-pregnancy demonstrated significant changes in weight gain and development length and a reduction in the number of platelets compared to controls. Significantly, pups born to mothers exposed to contaminated urban soil during the pregnancy displayed changes in birth weight, weight gain during the growth, development length, incisor eruption and opening of the ears in addition to a reduction in their physical performance and a change in the number of lymphocytes. These results clearly show the negative influence of parental exposure to contaminated urban soil on the general development of the rats during the periods studied. These data indicate that developing organisms are highly sensitive to external factors. Further, they demonstrate the utility of these various biomarkers for identifying and displaying toxic effects of exposure to contaminated soils. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Experimental; Health effects; Soil","Annau, Z., Cuomo, V., Mechanisms of neurotoxicity and their relationship to behavioral changes (1988) Toxicology, 49, pp. 219-225; Archer, J., Test for emotionality in rats and mice: a review (1973) Anim.

We evaluated the effects of IUGR on attention to a palatable food cue, as well as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) content in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in response to sweet food intake. From day 10 of gestation and through lactation, Sprague-Dawley rats received either an ad libitum (Adlib) or a 50% food-restricted (FR) diet. At birth, pups were cross-fostered, generating four groups (gestation/lactation): Adlib/Adlib (control), FR/Adlib (intrauterine growth-restricted), Adlib/FR, and FR/FR. Adult attention to palatable food cues was measured using the Attentional Set-Shifting Task (ASST), which uses a sweet pellet as reward. TH content in the OFC and NAcc was measured at baseline and in response to palatable food intake. At 90 days of age, FR/Adlib males ate more sweet food than controls, without differences in females. However, when compared to Controls, FR/Adlib females needed fewer trials to reach criterion in the ASST (p= 0.04) and exhibited increased TH content in the OFC in response to sweet food (p= 0.03). In the NAcc, there was a differential response of TH content after sweet food intake in both FR/Adlib males and females (p<. 0.05). Fetal programming of adult food preferences involves the central response to palatable food cues and intake, affecting dopamine release in select structures of the brain reward system. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Attention; Dopamine; Feeding; Fetal growth restriction; Rats","Gluckman, P.D., Hanson, M.A., Living with the past: evolution, development, and patterns of disease (2004) Science, 305, pp. 1733-1736; Hales, C.N., Barker, D.J.P., Clark, P.M.S., Cox, L.J., Fall, C., Osmond, C., Fetal and infant growth and impaired glucose-tolerance at age 64 (1991) Br Med J, 303, pp. 1019-1022; Phipps, K., Barker, D.J., Hales, C.N., Fall, C.H., Osmond, C., Clark, P.M., Fetal growth and impaired glucose tolerance in men and women (1993) Diabetologia, 36, pp. 225-228; Rich-Edwards, J.W., Stampfer, M.J., Manson, J.E., Rosner, B., Hankinson, S.E., Colditz, G.A., Birth weight and risk of cardiovascular disease in a cohort of women followed up since 1976 (1997) BMJ, 315, pp. 396-400; Bettiol, H., Sabbag, D., Haeffner, L.S.B., Barbieri, M.A., Silva, A.A.M., Portella, A., Do intrauterine growth restriction and overweight at primary school age increase the risk of elevated body mass index in young adults (2007) Braz J Med Biol Res, 40, pp. 1237-1243; Ravelli, G.P., Stein, Z.A., Susser, M.W., Obesity in young men after famine exposure in utero and early infancy (1976) New Engl J Med, 295, pp. 349-353; Ayres, C., Agranonik, M., Portella, A.K., Filion, F., Johnston, C.C., Silveira, P.P., Intrauterine growth restriction and the fetal programming of the hedonic response to sweet taste in newborn infants (2012) Int J Pediatr, 2012, p. 657379; Silveira, P.P., Agranonik, M., Faras, H., Portella, A.K., Meaney, M.J., Levitan, R.D., Preliminary evidence for an impulsivity-based thrifty eating phenotype (2012) Pediatr Res, 71, pp. 293-298; Crume, T.L., Scherzinger, A., Stamm, E., McDuffie, R., Bischoff, K.J., Hamman, R.F., The long-term impact of intrauterine growth restriction in a diverse US cohort of children: the EPOCH study (2013) Obesity (Silver Spring), 22 (2), pp. 608-615; Migraine, A., Nicklaus, S., Parnet, P., Lange, C., Monnery-Patris, S., Des Robert, C., Effect of preterm birth and birth weight on eating behavior at 2 y of age (2013) Am J Clin Nutr, 97, pp. 1270-1277; Barbieri, M.A., Portella, A.K., Silveira, P.P., Bettiol, H., Agranonik, M., Silva, A.A., Severe intrauterine growth restriction is associated with higher spontaneous carbohydrate intake in young women (2009) Pediatr Res, 65, pp. 215-220; Lussana, F., Painter, R.C., Ocke, M.C., Buller, H.R., Bossuyt, P.M., Roseboom, T.J., Prenatal exposure to the Dutch famine is associated with a preference for fatty foods and a more atherogenic lipid profile (2008) Am J Clin Nutr, 88, pp. 1648-1652; Stein, A.D., Rundle, A., Wada, N., Goldbohm, R.A., Lumey, L.H., Associations of gestational exposure to famine with energy balance and macronutrient density of the diet at age 58 years differ according to the reference population used (2009) J Nutr, 139, pp. 1555-1561; Perala, M.M., Mannisto, S., Kaartinen, N.E., Kajantie, E., Osmond, C., Barker, D.J.P., Body size at birth is associated with food and nutrient intake in adulthood (2012) PLoS One, 7, p. e46139; Kaseva, N., Wehkalampi, K., Hemio, K., Hovi, P., Jarvenpaa, A.L., Andersson, S., Diet and nutrient intake in Young adults born preterm at very low birth weight (2013) J Pediatr-Us, 163, pp. 43-48; Feldman, R., Eidelman, A.I., Neonatal state organization, neuromaturation, mother-infant interaction, and cognitive development in small-for-gestational-age premature infants (2006) Pediatrics, 118, pp. E869-E878; Watt, J., Interaction and development in the first year.

Congenital fusion of either the sagittal, metopic, or coronal sutures represents 95% of all cases of SSC. Sagittal and metopic synostosis have a male preponderance (3:1) while premature fusion of the coronal suture has a female preponderance (2:1). Although environmental and genetic factors contribute to SSC, the etiology of the majority of SSC cases remains unclear. In this study, 227 primary calvarial osteoblast cell lines from patients with coronal, metopic, or sagittal synostosis and unaffected controls were established and assayed for ALP activity and BrdU incorporation (n. = 226) as respective measures of early stage osteoblast differentiation and proliferation. Primary osteoblast cell lines from individuals with sagittal synostosis demonstrated higher levels of ALP activity and reduced proliferation when compared to control lines. In order to address the sex differences in SSC types, the data was further stratified by sex. Osteoblasts from males and females with sagittal synostosis as well as males with metopic synostosis demonstrated higher levels of ALP activity when compared to sex matched controls, and males with sagittal or metopic synostosis demonstrated reduced levels of proliferation. In order to elucidate genes and pathways involved in these observed phenotypes, correlation analyses comparing ALP activity and proliferation to global gene expression was performed. Transcripts related to osteoblast differentiation were identified both differentially up and downregulated, correlated with ALP activity when compared to controls, and demonstrated a striking sex specific gene expression pattern. These data support that the dysregulation of osteoblast differentiation plays a role in the development of SSC and that genetic factors contribute to the observed sex related differences. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Craniosynostosis; Gene expression analysis; Osteoblast differentiation; Osteoblasts","Gilbert, S.F., (2000) Developmental biology, , Sinauer Associates; Ornitz, D.M., Marie, P.J., FGF signaling pathways in endochondral and intramembranous bone development and human genetic disease (2002) Genes Dev, 16, pp. 1446-1465; Wilkie, A.O., Craniosynostosis: genes and mechanisms (1997) Hum Mol Genet, 6, pp. 1647-1656; Ratisoontorn, C., Seto, M.L., Broughton, K.M., Cunningham, M.L., In vitro differentiation profile of osteoblasts derived from patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (2005) Bone, 36, pp. 627-634; Opperman, L.A., Cranial sutures as intramembranous bone growth sites (2000) Dev Dyn, 219, pp. 472-485; Rice, D.P., Rice, R., Thesleff, I., Molecular mechanisms in calvarial bone and suture development, and their relation to craniosynostosis (2003) Eur J Orthod, 25, pp. 139-148; Cunningham, M.L., Heike, C.L., Evaluation of the infant with an abnormal skull shape (2007) Curr Opin Pediatr, 19, pp. 645-651; Vu, H.L., Panchal, J., Parker, E.E., Levine, N.S., Francel, P., The timing of physiologic closure of the metopic suture: a review of 159 patients using reconstructed 3D CT scans of the craniofacial region (2001) J Craniofac Surg, 12, pp. 527-532; Cohen, M.M., Sutural biology and the correlates of craniosynostosis (1993) Am J Med Genet, 47, pp. 581-616; Di Rocco, F., Arnaud, E., Renier, D., Evolution in the frequency of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (2009) J Neurosurg Pediatr, 4, pp. 21-25; French, L.R., Jackson, I.T., Melton, L.J., A population-based study of craniosynostosis (1990) J Clin Epidemiol, 43, pp. 69-73; Shuper, A., Merlob, P., Grunebaum, M., Reisner, S.H., The incidence of isolated craniosynostosis in the newborn infant (1985) Am J Dis Child, 139, pp. 85-86; Kolar, J.C., An epidemiological study of nonsyndromal craniosynostoses (2011) J Craniofac Surg, 22, pp. 47-49; Lajeunie, E., Le Merrer, M., Bonaiti-Pellie, C., Marchac, D., Renier, D., Genetic study of scaphocephaly (1996) Am J Med Genet, 62, pp. 282-285; Lajeunie, E., Le Merrer, M., Marchac, D., Renier, D., Syndromal and nonsyndromal primary trigonocephaly: analysis of a series of 237 patients (1998) Am J Med Genet, 75, pp. 211-215; Lajeunie, E., Le Merrer, M., Bonaiti-Pellie, C., Marchac, D., Renier, D., Genetic study of nonsyndromic coronal craniosynostosis (1995) Am J Med Genet, 55, pp. 500-504; Alderman, B.W., Lammer, E.J., Joshua, S.C., Cordero, J.F., Ouimette, D.R., Wilson, M.J., An epidemiologic study of craniosynostosis: risk indicators for the occurrence of craniosynostosis in Colorado (1988) Am J Epidemiol, 128, pp. 431-438; Rasmussen, S.A., Yazdy, M.M., Carmichael, S.L., Jamieson, D.J., Canfield, M.A., Honein, M.A., Maternal thyroid disease as a risk factor for craniosynostosis (2007) Obstet Gynecol, 110, pp. 369-377; Kallen, K., Maternal smoking and craniosynostosis (1999) Teratology, 60, pp. 146-150; Higginbottom, M.C., Jones, K.L., James, H.E., Intrauterine constraint and craniosynostosis (1980) Neurosurgery, 6, pp. 39-44; Sanchez-Lara, P.A., Carmichael, S.L., Graham, J.M., Lammer, E.J., Shaw, G.M., Ma, C., Fetal constraint as a potential risk factor for craniosynostosis (2010) Am J Med Genet A, 152A, pp. 394-400; Boyadjiev, S.A., Genetic analysis of non-syndromic craniosynostosis (2007) Orthod Craniofacial Res, 10, pp. 129-137; Fragale, A., Tartaglia, M., Bernardini, S., Di Stasi, A.M., Di Rocco, C., Velardi, F., Decreased proliferation and altered differentiation in osteoblasts from genetically and clinically distinct craniosynostotic disorders (1999) Am J Pathol, 154, pp. 1465-1477; De Pollack, C., Renier, D., Hott, M., Marie, P.J., Increased bone formation and osteoblastic cell phenotype in premature cranial suture ossification (craniosynostosis) (1996) J Bone Miner Res, 11, pp. 401-407; Rice, D.P., Connor, E.C., Veltmaat, J.M., Lana-Elola, E., Veistinen, L., Tanimoto, Y., Gli3Xt-J/Xt-J mice exhibit lambdoid suture craniosynostosis which results from altered osteoprogenitor proliferation and differentiation (2010) Hum Mol Genet, 19, pp. 3457-3467; Stamper, B.D., Park, S.S., Beyer, R.P., Bammler, T.K., Farin, F.M., Mecham, B., Differential expression of extracellular matrix-mediated pathways in single-suture craniosynostosis (2011) PLoS One, 6, p. e26557; Gentleman, R.C., Carey, V.J., Bates, D.M., Bolstad, B., Dettling, M., Dudoit, S., Bioconductor: open software development for computational biology and bioinformatics (2004) Genome Biol, 5, p.

This study was designed to evaluate the alterations in offspring rat cerebellum following increase of plasma Hcy level induced by maternal exposure to ethanol and to investigate the possible protective role of melatonin administration upon cerebellar ethanol-induced neurotoxicity. The adult female rats were divided randomly into 4 groups, including one control and three experimental groups, after vaginal plagues. Group I received normal saline, group II received ethanol (4. g/kg), group III received ethanol. +. melatonin (10. mg/kg) and group IV received melatonin on day 6 of gestation until weaning. 21 days after birth, plasma Hcy level, level of lipid peroxidation, the activities of several antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and levels of bcl-2 and bax mRNA expression in cerebellum were determined. Our results demonstrated that ethanol could induce lipid peroxidation, and decrease antioxidants activities and increase plasma total Hcy level. We also observed that ethanol impaired performance on the rotarod and locomotor activities of rats. However, treatment with melatonin significantly attenuated motoric impairment, the lipid peroxidation process and restored the levels of antioxidant activities and significantly reduced plasma total Hcy levels. Moreover, melatonin reduced bax/bcl-2 ratio in the presence of ethanol. We conclude that these results provide evidence that ethanol neurotoxicity in part is related to increase of plasma Hcy levels and melatonin with reducing of plasma Hcy level has neuroprotective effects against ethanol toxicity in cerebellum. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Ethanol; Homocysteine; Melatonin; Oxidative stress; Purkinje cell; Rat","Jones, K.L., Smith, D.W., Ulleland, C.N., Streissguth, P., Pattern of malformation in offspring of chronic alcoholic mothers (1973) Lancet, 1, pp. 1267-1271; Floyd, R.L., O'Connor, M.J., Sokol, R.J., Bertrand, J., Cordero, J.F., Recognition and prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome (2005) Obstet Gynecol, 106, pp. 1059-1064; Guerri, C., Mechanisms involved in central nervous system dysfunctions induced by prenatal ethanol exposure (2002) Neurotox Res, 4, pp. 327-335; Komuro, H., Rakic, P., Distinct modes of neuronal migration in different domains of developing cerebellar cortex (1998) J Neurosci, 18, pp. 1478-1490; Burke, M.W., Palmour, R.M., Ervin, F.R., Ptito, M., Neuronal reduction in frontal cortex of primates after prenatal alcohol exposure (2009) NeuroReport, 20, pp. 13-17; Fryer, S.L., Schweinsburg, B.C., Bjorkquist, O.A., Frank, L.R., Mattson, S.N., Spadoni, A.D., Characterization of white matter microstructure in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (2009) Alcohol Clin Exp Res, 33, pp. 514-521; Heaton, M.B., Paiva, M., Madorsky, I., Shaw, G., Ethanol effects on neonatal rat cortex: comparative analyses of neurotrophic factors, apoptosis-related proteins, and oxidative processes during vulnerable and resistant periods (2003) Brain Res Dev Brain Res, 145, pp. 249-262; Willoughby, K.A., Sheard, E.D., Nash, K., Rovet, J., Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on hippocampal volume, verbal learning, and verbal and spatial recall in late childhood (2008) J Int Neuropsychol Soc, 14, pp. 1022-1033; Crews, F.T., Nixon, K., Mechanisms of neurodegeneration and regeneration in alcoholism (2009) Alcohol Alcohol, 44, pp. 115-127; Haorah, J., Ramirez, S.H., Floreani, N., Gorantla, S., Morsey, B., Persidsky, Y., Mechanism of alcohol-induced oxidative stress and neuronal injury (2008) Free Radic Biol Med, 45, pp. 1542-1550; Hampton, M.B., Orrenius, S., Redox regulation of apoptotic cell death (1998) BioFactors, 8, pp. 1-5; Cohen-Kerem, R., Koren, G., Antioxidants and fetal protection against ethanol teratogenicity.

In 1998, the Chinese government imposed stringent air pollution regulations, in one of the first large-scale regulatory attempts in a developing country. We find that the infant mortality rate fell by 20 percent in the treatment cities designated as ""Two Control Zones."" The greatest reduction in mortality occurred during the neonatal period, highlighting an important pathophysiologic mechanism, and was largest among infants born to mothers with low levels of education. The finding is robust to various alternative hypotheses and specifications. Further, a falsification test using deaths from causes unrelated to air pollution supports these findings. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; China; Environmental regulation; Infant mortality","Almond, D., Chay, K.Y., Lee, D.S., The costs of low birth weight (2005) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 120 (3), pp. 1031-1083; Almond, D., Chen, Y., Greenstone, M., Li, H., Winter heating or clean air?

In the central brain and ventral ganglia, neuroblasts are specified and delaminate from the neuroectoderm during embryonic development under the control of proneural and neurogenic genes. In contrast, in the optic lobes, neuroepithelial cells are transformed into neuroblasts postembryonically by a spatial wave of proneural gene expression. Central brain and ventral nerve cord neuroblasts manifest a short embryonic proliferation period followed by a stage of quiescence and then undergo a prolonged postembryonic proliferation period during which most of the differentiated neurons of the adult CNS are generated. While most neuroblasts belong to a type I class that produces neuronal lineages through non-selfrenewing ganglion mother cells, a small subset of type II neuroblasts generates exceptionally large neuronal lineages through self-renewing intermediate progenitor cells that have a transit amplifying function. All neuroblasts in the CNS generate their neural progeny through an asymmetric cell division mode in which the interplay of apical complex and basal complex molecules in the mitotically active progenitor results in the segregation of cell fate determinants into the smaller more differentiated daughter cell. Defects in this molecular control of asymmetric cell division in neuroblasts can result in brain tumor formation. Proliferating neuroblast lineages in the developing CNS utilize transcription factor cascades as a generic mechanism for temporal patterning and birth order-dependent determination of differential neural cell fate. This contributes to the generation of a remarkable diversity of cell types in the developing CNS from a surprisingly small set of neural stem cell-like precursors. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","Asymmetric cell division; Neuroblast; Proliferation; Temporal series; Tumor","Almeida, M.S., Bray, S.J., Regulation of post-embryonic neuroblasts by Drosophila Grainyhead (2005) Mech Dev, 122, pp. 1282-1293; Artavanis-Tsakonas, S., Simpson, P., Choosing a cell fate: A view from the Notch locus (1991) Trends Genetics, 7, pp. 403-408; Atwood, S.X., Prehoda, K.E., aPKC Phosphorylates Miranda to polarize fate determinants during neuroblast asymmetric cell division (2009) Curr Biol, 19, pp. 723-729; Baumgardt, M., Karlsson, D., Terriente, J., Diaz-Benjumea, F.J., Thor, S., Neuronal subtype specification within a lineage by opposing temporal feed-forward loops (2009) Cell, 139, pp. 969-982; Bayraktar, O.A., Boone, J.Q., Drummond, M.L., Doe, C.Q., Drosophila type II neuroblast lineages keep Prospero levels low to generate large clones that contribute to the adult brain central complex (2010) Neural Dev, 5, p. 26; Bayraktar, O.A., Doe, C.Q., Combinatorial temporal patterning in progenitors expands neural diversity (2013) Nature, 498, pp. 449-455; Beaucher, M., Goodliffe, J., Hersperger, E., Trunova, S., Frydman, H., Shearn, A., Drosophila brain tumor metastases express both neuronal and glial cell type markers (2007) Dev Biol, 301, pp. 287-297; Bello, B., Holbro, N., Reichert, H., Polycomb group genes are required for neural stem cell survival in postembryonic neurogenesis of Drosophila (2007) Development, 134, pp. 1091-1099; Bello, B., Reichert, H., Hirth, F., The brain tumor gene negatively regulates neural progenitor cell proliferation in the larval central brain of Drosophila (2006) Development, 133, pp. 2639-2648; Bello, B.C., Hirth, F., Gould, A.P., A pulse of the Drosophila Hox protein Abdominal-A schedules the end of neural proliferation via neuroblast apoptosis (2003) Neuron, 37, pp. 209-219; Bello, B.C., Izergina, N., Caussinus, E., Reichert, H., Amplification of neural stem cell proliferation by intermediate progenitor cells in Drosophila brain development (2008) Neural Dev, 3, p. 5; Benito-Sipos, J., Estacio-Gomez, A., Moris-Sanz, M., Baumgardt, M., Thor, S., Diaz-Benjumea, F.J., A genetic cascade involving klumpfuss, nab and castor specifies the abdominal leucokinergic neurons in the Drosophila CNS (2010) Development, 137, pp. 3327-3336; Benito-Sipos, J., Ulvklo, C., Gabilondo, H., Baumgardt, M., Angel, A., Torroja, L., Thor, S., Seven up acts as a temporal factor during two different stages of neuroblast 5-6 development (2011) Development, 138, pp. 5311-5320; Berger, C., Harzer, H., Burkard, T.R., Steinmann, J., van der Horst, S., Laurenson, A.S., Novatchkova, M., Knoblich, J.A., FACS purification and transcriptome analysis of drosophila neural stem cells reveals a role for Klumpfuss in self-renewal (2012) Cell Rep, 2, pp. 407-418; Betschinger, J., Mechtler, K., Knoblich, J.A., The Par complex directs asymmetric cell division by phosphorylating the cytoskeletal protein Lgl (2003) Nature, 422, pp. 326-330; Betschinger, J., Mechtler, K., Knoblich, J.A., Asymmetric segregation of the tumor suppressor brat regulates self-renewal in Drosophila neural stem cells (2006) Cell, 124, pp. 1241-1253; Boone, J.Q., Doe, C.Q., Identification of Drosophila type II neuroblast lineages containing transit amplifying ganglion mother cells (2008) Dev Neurol, 68, pp. 1185-1195; Bossing, T., Udolph, G., Doe, C.Q., Technau, G.M., The embryonic central nervous system lineages of Drosophila melanogaster.

In this study, we investigate the maturation of two subpopulations of V3 INs in the mouse spinal cord during this period. To do this, we conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of tdTomato fluorescent protein-expressing spinal V3 INs from Sim1Cre/+;tdTom mice at post-natal day (P) 0, P4, P9 and P14 and compared their properties to those at P21. Combining electrophysiology with computational analyses, we show that dorsal and ventral V3 subpopulations are physiologically distinct at birth, but the electrophysiological properties of V3 INs change significantly during the first three post-natal weeks. We further reveal that there are multiple developmental phases of both V3 subpopulations during the maturation process. The different developmental trajectories of physiological properties also coincide with changes in an animal's locomotor behavior. These properties likely reflect the differential functions of V3 subpopulations in maturing spinal locomotor circuits. © 2015 IBRO.","Computational analysis; Electrophysiological properties; Interneuron subpopulations; Neuronal maturation; Patch-clamp recordings; Spinal cord","Abbinanti, M.D., Zhong, G., Harris-Warrick, R.M., Postnatal emergence of serotonin-induced plateau potentials in commissural interneurons of the mouse spinal cord (2012) J Neurophysiol, 108 (8), pp. 2191-2202; Arber, S., Motor circuits in action: specification, connectivity, and function (2012) Neuron, 74 (6), pp. 975-989; Blacklaws, J., Deska-Gauthier, D., Jones, C.T., Petracca, Y.L., Liu, M., Zhang, H., Fawcett, J.P., Zhang, Y., Sim1 is required for the migration and axonal projections of V3 interneurons in the developing mouse spinal cord (2015) Dev Neurobiol, , (Published online); Borowska, J., Jones, C.T., Zhang, H., Blacklaws, J., Goulding, M., Zhang, Y., Functional subpopulations of V3 interneurons in the mature mouse spinal cord (2013) J Neurosci, 33 (47), pp. 18553-18565; Carrascal, L., Nieto-Gonzalez, J.L., Cameron, W.E., Torres, B., Nunez-Abades, P.A., Changes during the postnatal development in physiological and anatomical characteristics of rat motoneurons studied in vitro (2005) Brain Res Brain Res Rev, 49 (2), pp. 377-387; Clarac, F., Brocard, F., Vinay, L., The maturation of locomotor networks (2004) Prog Brain Res, 143, pp. 57-66; Cotel, F., Antri, M., Barthe, J.Y., Orsal, D., Identified ankle extensor and flexor motoneurons display different firing profiles in the neonatal rat (2009) J Neurosci, 29 (9), pp. 2748-2753; Ehrlich, D.E., Ryan, S.J., Rainnie, D.G., Postnatal development of electrophysiological properties of principal neurons in the rat basolateral amygdala (2012) J Physiol, 590, pp. 4819-4838; Gao, B.X., Ziskind-Conhaim, L., Development of ionic currents underlying changes in action potential waveforms in rat spinal motoneurons (1998) J Neurophysiol, 80 (6), pp. 3047-3061; Goulding, M., Circuits controlling vertebrate locomotion: moving in a new direction (2009) Nat Rev Neurosci, 10, pp. 507-518; Jiang, Z., Rempel, J., Li, J., Sawchuk, M.A., Carlin, K.P., Brownstone, R.M., Development of L-type calcium channels and a nifedipine-sensitive motor activity in the postnatal mouse spinal cord (1999) Eur J Neurosci, 11 (10), pp. 3481-3487; Kiehn, O., Development and functional organization of spinal locomotor circuits (2011) Curr Opin Neurobiol, 21, pp. 100-109; Lam, T., Pearson, K.G., The role of proprioceptive feedback in the regulation and adaptation of locomotor activity (2002) Adv Exp Med Biol, 508, pp. 343-355; Ma, Y., Hu, H., Berrebi, A.S., Mathers, P.H., Agmon, A., Distinct subtypes of somatostatin-containing neocortical interneurons revealed in transgenic mice (2006) J Neurosci., 26 (19), pp. 5069-5082; Murphy, G.J., Du Lac, S., Postnatal development of spike generation in rat medial vestibular nucleus neurons (2001) J Neurophysiol, 85 (5), pp. 1899-1906; Song, Z.M., Hu, J., Rudy, B., Redman, S.J., Developmental changes in the expression of calbindin and potassium-channel subunits Kv3.1b and Kv3.2 in mouse Renshaw cells (2006) Neuroscience, 139 (2), pp. 531-538; Vinay, L., Brocard, F., Pflieger, J.F., Simeoni-Alias, J., Clarac, F., Perinatal development of lumbar motoneurons and their inputs in the rat (2000) Brain Res Bull, 53 (5), pp. 635-647; Walsh, M.A., Graham, B.A., Brichta, A.M., Callister, R.J., Evidence for a critical period in the development of excitability and potassium currents in mouse lumbar superficial dorsal horn neurons (2009) J Neurophysiol, 101 (4), pp. 1800-1812; Wilson, J.M., Rempel, J., Brownstone, R.M., Postnatal development of cholinergic synapses on mouse spinal motoneurons (2004) J Comp Neurol, 474 (1), pp. 13-23; Zhang, Y., Narayan, S., Geiman, E., Lanuza, G.M., Velasquez, T., Shanks, B., Akay, T., Goulding, M., V3 spinal neurons establish a robust and balanced locomotor rhythm during walking (2008) Neuron, 60, pp. 84-96",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926476574

Gestational exposure to PBDE-209 can accumulate in pregnant women and fetuses via the placenta and umbilical cord, affecting perinatal outcome. In this study, pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into five groups and intragastrically administered peanut oil (vehicle) 1, 5 and 10. mg/kg by body weight (b.w.) of PBDE-209, or nothing (control) from day 0 (G0) to day 21 (G21) gestation, respectively. Placental samples were collected on G21 by cesarean section. The mRNA and protein expressions of ET-1, eNOS and iNOS in the placenta were examined using qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Total nitric oxide (NO) in the placenta was measured using a specific ELISA kit. Compared with the control and vehicle groups, the mRNA expression of ET-1 and iNOS in the placenta was gradually and significantly increased after exposure to increasing concentrations of PBDE-209 (P<. 0.05), while the mRNA level of eNOS in the placenta was gradually and significantly reduced after exposure to increasing concentrations of PBDE-209 (P<. 0.05). The expression trends of ET-1, eNOS and iNOS proteins were consistent with those of mRNA expression. Interestingly, the production of total NO was significantly increased after exposure to 5 and 10. mg/kg b.w. PBDE-209 (P<. 0.05). Finally, the birth weight of the offspring rats was significantly reduced after maternal exposure to 5 and 10. mg/kg b.w. PBDE-209 compared with the control and vehicle groups (P<. 0.05).

To test this hypothesis, pregnant female CD-1 mice were orally dosed daily with tocopherol-stripped corn oil (vehicle control) or DEHP (20. μg/kg/day-750. mg/kg/day) from gestation day 11-birth. Pups were counted, weighed, and sexed at birth, ovaries were subjected to evaluations of follicle numbers on postnatal days (PNDs) 8 and 21, and fertility was evaluated at 3-9 months. The results indicate that prenatal DEHP exposure increased male-to-female ratio compared to controls. Prenatal DEHP exposure also increased preantral follicle numbers at PND 21 compared to controls. Further, 22.2% of the 20. μg/kg/day treated animals took longer than 5 days to get pregnant at 3 months and 28.6% of the 750. mg/kg/day treated animals lost some of their pups at 6 months. Thus, prenatal DEHP exposure alters F1 sex ratio, increases preantral follicle numbers, and causes some breeding abnormalities. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","DEHP; Estrous cyclicity; Female reproduction; Ovary; Phthalate; Sex ratio","(2011) National Toxicology Program di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate.

It is accompanied by inflammatory processes with free radical generation and oxidative stress. The aim of study was to determine the role of oxidative stress in the development of neonatal RDS. Methods: Markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant activity in umbilical cord blood were studied in infants with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome with reference to healthy newborns. Results: Status of markers of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxy guanosine) showed a significant increase with depleted levels of total antioxidant capacity in neonatal RDS when compared to healthy newborns. Conclusion: The study provides convincing evidence of oxidative damage and diminished antioxidant defenses in newborns with RDS. Neonatal RDS is characterized by damage of lipid, protein and DNA, which indicates the augmentation of oxidative stress. General significance: The identification of the potential biomarker of oxidative stress consists of a promising strategy to study the pathophysiology of neonatal RDS. © 2014.","Antioxidant; Free radical; Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome; Oxidative stress","Negi, R., Pande, D., Kumar, A., Khanna, R.S., Khanna, H.D., In vivo oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation as a biomarker of oxidative stress in preterm low birth weight infants (2012) J.

This correlation was tested experimentally in hypersaline conditions by submitting the extremely euryhaline tilapia species Sarotherodon melanotheron heudelotii (Cichlidae), found throughout West African continental waters and commonly used as an aquaculture species, to a strong salinity gradient (15-106). Experimental and control individuals were reared from birth in a closed system at a constant salinity of 10 and injected with oxytetracycline (OTC) to mark the otoliths at the beginning of the experiment. Randomly selected control fish were maintained for 75days at salinities of 10-20. The remaining experimental fish were acclimated to a salinity above 100 which was reduced by 10 each week to a salinity of 20. The salinity and temperature of the water were recorded every day and the Sr concentrations in the water were measured weekly by solution-based ICP-MS. The fish from the control and experimental groups were sampled weekly and otolith transverse sections were prepared for Sr:Ca measurements by laser ablation ICP-MS. No significant difference in the otolith growth rates after OTC marking was found between the control and experimental groups (ANCOVA, p=0.63), showing that the experimental design did not affect fish growth. The Sr concentration in the water was closely related to ambient salinity (positive linear regression, R2=0.96). For most of the fish tested (~80%), the relationship between otolith Sr:Ca and salinity was positive but nonlinear (power law, R2=0.77 on log-log plot). However, about 20% of individuals from both the control and the experimental groups showed consistently low Sr:Ca ratios irrespective of the salinity, suggesting that the Sr incorporation into the otoliths in these fish was strongly regulated. This shows that there is high variability between individuals in the regulation of Sr incorporation by a euryhaline species and indicates that otolith datasets for ecological applications should be interpreted with caution. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Euryhaline tilapia; Otolith microchemistry; Salinity; Sarotherodon melanotheron heudelotii; Strontium; Validation","Arai, T., Effect of salinity on strontium:calcium ratios in the otoliths of Sakhalin taimen, Hucho perryi (2010) Fish.

Hence, here we investigated whether the exposure of FA on pregnant rats could affect the development of an innate acute lung injury in offspring induced by lipopolissacaride (LPS) injection. Pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to FA (0.92mg/m3) or vehicle (distillated water), both 1h/day, 5 days/week, from 1 to 21 days of pregnancy. Non-manipulated rats were used as control. After 30 days of birth, the offspring was submitted to injection of LPS (Salmonella abortus equi, 5mg/kg, i.p.). Systemic and lung inflammatory parameters were evaluated 24h later. Exposure to FA during gestation abolished the development of acute lung injury in offspring, as observed by reduced number of leukocytes in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BAL), in the blood and in the bone marrow, and decreased myeloperoxidase activity in the lung. Moreover, phagocytes from BAL presented normal phagocytosis, but reduced oxidative burst. Alterations on the profile of inflammatory cytokines were evidenced by reduced mRNA levels of IL-6 and elevated levels of IL-10 and IFN gamma in the lung tissue. Indeed, mRNA levels of toll-likereceptor-4 and nuclear factor-kappa B translocation into the nucleus were also reduced. Additionally, hyperresponsiveness to methacholine was blunted in the trachea of offspring of FA exposed mothers. Together, our data clearly show that FA exposure in the prenatal period modifies the programming mechanisms of the innate defense in the offspring leading to impaired defense against infections. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Acute lung injury; Cytokines; LPS; NF-kappa B; Oxidative burst; Pollutants; Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)","Andonegui, G., Bonder, C.S., Green, F., Endotheliumderived toll-like receptor-4 is the key molecule in LPS-induced neutrophil sequestration into lungs (2003) J.

Our earlier studies indicate that both maternal vitamin B<inf>12</inf> and omega-3 fatty acids influence brain development by regulating the levels of neurotrophins. Literature suggests that there exists a cross talk between neurotrophins like nerve growth factor (NGF) and angiogenic factors like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). It remains to be established whether maternal nutrients like vitamin B<inf>12</inf> and omega-3 fatty acids influence the levels of angiogenic markers like VEGF and NGF in the brain of the offspring. Therefore the present study examines the effect of maternal vitamin B<inf>12</inf> and omega-3 fatty acids on protein and mRNA levels of VEGF, HIF-1 alpha (hypoxia inducible factor alpha) and NGF in the pup brain at birth. Pregnant Wistar rats were divided into five dietary groups (n=8 each): control, vitamin B<inf>12</inf> deficient, vitamin B<inf>12</inf> deficient+omega-3 fatty acid, vitamin B<inf>12</inf> supplemented, vitamin B<inf>12</inf> supplemented+omega-3 fatty acid. At birth the pups were dissected to collect the brain tissue. Maternal vitamin B<inf>12</inf> deficiency showed lower (p<0.05) pup brain mRNA and protein levels (p<0.01) of VEGF, higher (p<0.01) HIF-1 alpha protein levels, lower (p<0.05) NGF protein levels while NGF mRNA levels were not altered. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation to a vitamin B<inf>12</inf> deficient group normalized the VEGF mRNA levels, NGF protein levels and HIF-1 alpha protein levels. Vitamin B<inf>12</inf> supplementation showed similar protein and mRNA levels of VEGF and NGF as well as HIF-1 alpha protein levels as compared to control. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation to the vitamin B<inf>12</inf> supplemented group showed higher (p<0.01) protein and mRNA levels of NGF but the protein and mRNA levels of VEGF were comparable to control. In conclusion maternal vitamin B<inf>12</inf> and omega-3 fatty acids both influence the levels and expression of neurotrophins and angiogenic factors in the offspring brain suggesting a possible benefit of combined maternal supplementation of these vital nutrients. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","HIF-1 alpha; NGF; Omega-3 fatty acids; VEGF; Vitamin b<inf>12</inf>","Benderro, G.F., Sun, X., Kuang, Y., Lamanna, J.C., Decreased VEGF expression and microvascular density: but increased HIF-1 and 2α accumulation and EPO expression in chronic moderate hyperoxia in the mouse brain (2012) Brain Res., 1471, pp. 46-55; Berry, A., Bindocci, E., Alleva, E., NGF, brain and behavioral plasticity (2012) Neural Plast., 784, p. 040; Calza, L., Giardino, L., Giuliani, A., Aloe, L., Levi-Montalcini, R., Nerve growth factor control of neuronal expression of angiogenetic and vasoactive factors (2001) Proc.

The results of the present study demonstrate the postnatal effects of in utero exposure to AfB1 in the rat. Pregnant Wistar rats were given 10, 20, or 50 μg AfB1/kg body weight daily from gestation day (GD) 12 to GD 19. At parturition, newborns were observed for clinical signs and survival. All animals were born alive and initially appeared to be active. Male pups from control and AfB1-exposed animals were weaned and maintained up to postnatal day (PD) 100. Litter size, birth weight, sex ratio, survival rate, and crown–rump length of the pups were significantly decreased in AfB1-exposed rats when compared to controls. Elapsed time (days) for testes to descend into the scrotal sac was significantly delayed in experimental pups when compared to control pups. Behavioral observations such as cliff avoidance, negative geotaxis, surface rightening activity, ascending wire mesh, open field behavior, and exploratory and locomotory activities were significantly impaired in experimental pups. Body weights and the indices of testis, cauda epididymis, prostate, seminal vesicles, and liver were significantly reduced on PD 100 in male rats exposed to AfB1 during embryonic development when compared with controls. Significant reduction in the testicular daily sperm production, epididymal sperm count, and number of viable, motile, and hypo-osmotic tail coiled sperm was observed in experimental rats. The levels of serum testosterone and activity levels of testicular hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner with a significant increase in the serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone in experimental rats. Deterioration in the testicular and cauda epididymal architecture was observed in experimental rats. The results of fertility studies revealed a significant decrease in the mating index in experimental rats with an increase in the pre- and post-implantation losses in rats mated with prenatal AfB1-exposed males, indicating poor male reproductive performance. These results indicate that in utero exposure to AfB1 severely compromised postnatal development of neonatal rats, and caused a delay in testes descent and reduction in steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis that were accomplished by suppressed reproduction at adulthood. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Aflatoxin B1;

Traditionally, experimental approaches to study the effects of gaze have focused on how human observers respond to gaze cues and how attention, perception and action control is influenced by them. In recent years, the investigation of gaze behavior has moved toward the inclusion of more ecologically valid conditions, in which gaze signals are exchanged as part of an ongoing reciprocal social interaction. Such an 'interactive turn' is beginning to yield new insights into the behavioral dynamics and neural mechanisms of gaze behavior as they unfold in real life. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Haith, M.M., Bergman, T., Moore, M.J., Eye contact and face scanning in early infancy (1977) Science, 198, pp. 853-855; Frischen, A., Bayliss, A.P., Tipper, S.P., Gaze cueing of attention: visual atten-tion: social cognition, and individual differences (2007) Psychol Bull, 133, pp. 694-724; Kuzmanovic, B., Georgescu, A.L., Eickhoff, S.B., Shah, N.J., Bente, G., Fink, G.R., Vogeley, K., Duration matters: dissociating neural correlates of detection and evaluation of social gaze (2009) Neuroimage, 46, pp. 1154-1163; Macrae, C.N., Hood, B.M., Milne, A.B., Rowe, A.C., Mason, M.F., Are you looking at me?

Pain was induced in rat pups via needle pricks of the paws. Sucrose solution or paracetamol was administered for analgesia before the paw prick. Control groups include tactile stimulation to account for handling and touching the paws, and sucrose alone was used. All treatments were started on day one of birth and continued for 8. weeks. At the end of the treatments, behavioral studies were conducted to test the spatial learning and memory using radial arm water maze (RAWM), as well as pain threshold via foot-withdrawal response to a hot plate apparatus. Additionally, the hippocampus was dissected, and blood was collected. Levels of neurotrophins (BDNF, IGF-1 and NT-3) and endorphins were assessed using ELISA. The results show that chronic noxious stimulation resulted in comparable foot-withdrawal latency between noxious and tactile groups. On the other hand, pretreatment with sucrose or paracetamol increased pain threshold significantly both in naive rats and noxiously stimulated rats (P < 0.05). Chronic pain during early life impaired short-term memory, and sucrose treatment prevented such impairment (P < 0.05). Sucrose significantly increased serum levels of endorphin and enkephalin. Chronic pain decreased levels of BDNF in the hippocampus and this decrease was prevented by sucrose and paracetamol treatments. Hippocampal levels of NT-3 and IGF-1 were not affected by any treatment. In conclusion, chronic pain induction during early life induced short memory impairment, and pretreatment with sucrose prevented this impairment via mechanisms that seem to involve BDNF. As evident in the results, sucrose, whether alone or in the presence of pre-noxious stimulation, increases pain threshold in such circumstances; most likely via a mechanism that involves an increase in endogenous opioids. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Foot-withdrawal; Hippocampus; Maze; Memory; Pain; Sucrose","Al Amin, H.A., Atweh, S.F., Jabbur, S.J., Saade, N.E., Effects of ventral hippocampal lesion on thermal and mechanical nociception in neonates and adult rats (2004) Eur.

The offspring of ad libitum fed dams (control) and ~50% food-restricted (during the late gestational period) dams (IUGR) were sub-divided into ad libitum fed (fed) and 48. h food deprivation (FD) groups at 10 weeks of age. In each group, the serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, and leptin and the hypothalamic mRNA expression levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) regulatory factors were measured. The serum LH and testosterone levels of the IUGR-fed rats were significantly or tend to be higher than those of the control-fed rats, respectively. The serum LH levels of the IUGR-FD rats were lower than those of the IUGR-fed rats. Similarly, the serum testosterone levels of the IUGR-FD rats tended to be lower than those of the IUGR-fed rats. On the other hand, the serum LH and testosterone levels of the control-fed and control-FD rats did not differ. The serum leptin levels of the IUGR fed rats were higher than those of the control-fed rats. The serum leptin levels of the control-FD and IUGR-FD rats were lower than those of the control-fed and IUGR-fed rats, respectively. The hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA levels of the IUGR-FD rats were higher than those of the IUGR-fed rats. Similarly, hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels of control-FD rats were higher than those of the control-fed rats. The hypothalamic kisspeptin, kisspeptin receptor, RFamide-related peptide, GPR147, and OBRb mRNA levels of control fed rats did not differ between control-fed and IUGR-fed rats. Their mRNA levels of the fed and FD rats did not differ in the control or IUGR groups. These results suggested that prenatal undernutrition increased the basal LH and testosterone production, whereas they are easily reduced by food deprivation in male rats. Changes of serum leptin level, but not of hypothalamic reproductive related factors, might be involved in these alterations. However, the precise mechanisms responsible for these effects remain unclear. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","IUGR; LH; NPY; Testosterone","Bergendahl, M., Perheentupa, A., Huhtaniemi, I., Effects of short-term starvation on reproductive hormone gene expression, secretion and receptor levels in male rats (1989) J.

In the present study, we investigated the implication of the excitatory amino acid in physiological nociception by using mutant mice deficient in phosphate-activated glutaminase type 1 (GLS1), the enzyme that synthesizes glutamate in central glutamatergic neurons. Because homozygous GLS1-/- mutants die shortly after birth, assays for assessing mechanical, thermal and chemical (formalin) nociception were performed on heterozygous GLS1+/- mutants, which present a clear-cut decrease in glutamate synthesis in central neurons. As compared to paired wild-type mice, adult male GLS1+/- mutants showed decreased responsiveness to mechanical (von Frey filament and tail-pressure, but not tail-clip, tests) and thermal (Hargreaves' plantar, tail-immersion and hot-plate tests) nociceptive stimuli. Genotype-related differences were also found in the formalin test for which GLS1+/- mice exhibited marked decreases in the nociceptive responses (hindlimb lift, lick and flinch) during both phase 1 (0-5. min) and phase 2 (16-45. min) after formalin injection. On the other hand, acute treatment with memantine (1. mg/kg i.p.), an uncompetitive antagonist at NMDA glutamate receptors, reduced nociception responses in wild-type but not GLS1+/- mice. Conversely, antinociceptive response to acute administration of a low dose (1. mg/kg s.c.) of morphine was significantly larger in GLS1+/- mutants versus wild-type mice. Our findings indicate that genetically driven hypoactivity of central glutamatergic neurotransmission renders mice hyposensitive to nociceptive stimulations, and promotes morphine antinociception, further emphasizing the critical role of glutamate in physiological nociception and its opioid-mediated control. © 2015 IBRO.","Formalin;

Women using the pill can decide when and whether to have children and whether to maintain their attachment to the labor force. This ability may increase women's autonomy, making divorce more feasible. The pill's effects are identified through a quasi-experiment exploiting differences in the language of the Comstock anti-obscenity statutes approved in the late 1800s and early 1900s in the United States. Empirical evidence from state-level data on US divorce rates 1950 to 1985 shows that sales bans of oral contraceptives have a negative impact on divorce. These findings are robust to alternative specifications and controls for observed (such as women's labor force participation) and unobserved state-specific factors, and time-varying factors at the state level.

Three groups were compared: French-English bilinguals who acquired two languages from birth (simultaneous), French-English bilinguals who learned their L2 after the age of 5. years (sequential), and English-speaking monolinguals. While the bilingual groups contrasted in age of acquisition, they were matched for language proficiency, although sequential bilinguals produced speech with a less native-like accent in their L2 than in their L1. Simultaneous bilinguals activated similar brain regions to an equivalent degree when reading in their two languages. In contrast, sequential bilinguals more strongly activated areas related to speech-motor control and orthographic to phonological mapping, the left inferior frontal gyrus, left premotor cortex, and left fusiform gyrus, when reading aloud in L2 compared to L1. In addition, the activity in these regions showed a significant positive correlation with age of acquisition. The results provide evidence for the engagement of overlapping neural substrates for processing two languages when acquired in native context from birth. However, it appears that the maturation of certain brain regions for both speech production and phonological encoding is limited by a sensitive period for L2 acquisition regardless of language proficiency. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Age of acquisition; Bilingualism; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Overt sentence reading; Phonology; Sensitive period; Speech production","Baayen, R.H., Piepenbrock, R., van Rijn, H., The CELEX Lexical Database.

After 30 days of intraperitoneal administration of saline or 0.0025 mg/kg (10-5 mol/l) of R-(-)-deprenyl dissolved in saline, males were mated with females of the same strain. Subsequently, animals were killed by thiopental, and their blood and sperm were collected. We found that epididymis of males exposed to R-(-)-deprenyl had higher sperm count (P&lt;0.05), and females who mated with these males gave birth to a greater number of offspring (P&lt;0.05) compared to control. The blood of experimental animals contained higher levels of testosterone (P&lt;0.05), FSH (P&lt;0.01), and total antioxidants (P&lt;0.01). We did not detect sperm DNA fragmentation in control or in experimental males. Interestingly, round spermatids were often observed inside seminiferous tubules of experimental animals, but obviously without any negative consequences on male fertility. Our findings could be verified on a sample of human male volunteers treated for infertility, because human organism tolerate higher doses of R-(-)-deprenyl, which is a selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B employed in our experiment and used in the therapy of Parkinson's disease, rather well. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It is unknown whether supplementing l-leucine to breast-fed neonates may enhance their small-intestinal development. This hypothesis was tested with a piglet model. Seven-day-old sow-reared pigs with an average birth weight of 1.45 kg were assigned randomly to the control or leucine group (n = 30/group). Piglets in the leucine group were orally administrated with 1.4 g l-leucine/kg body weight, whereas piglets in the control group received isonitrogenous l-alanine, twice daily for 14 days. The supplemental l-leucine amounted to 200 % of l-leucine intake from sow’s milk by 7-day-old pigs. At the end of the 2-week experiment, tissue samples were collected for determining intestinal morphology, expression of genes for intestinal leucine transporters (real-time RT-PCR and western blot analysis), and plasma metabolites and hormones. l-leucine administration increased (P < 0.05) villus height in the duodenum, an elevated ratio of villus height to crypt depth in the duodenum and ileum, plasma concentrations of leucine, glutamine and asparagine, as well as body-weight gains. mRNA levels for l-leucine transporters (SLC6A14, SLC6A19 and SLC7A9) and the abundance of the ATB0,+ protein were increased (P < 0.05) but those for SLC7A7 mRNA and the LAT2 protein were decreased (P < 0.05) in the jejunum of leucine-supplemented piglets, compared with the control. Plasma concentrations of ammonia, urea, triglycerides, and growth-related hormones did not differ between the control and leucine groups. Collectively, these results indicate that l-leucine supplementation improves intestinal development and whole-body growth in suckling piglets with a normal birth weight. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Wien","Gene expression; Milk; Nutrition; Small intestine; Swine",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928734037

This study explores the underlying reasons why women profess such happiness and how these relate to their motivations to avoid pregnancy. Between September 2013 and February 2014, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 27 women (8 white, 19 Latina) selected from a longitudinal study measuring prospective pregnancy intentions and feelings among 403 women in Austin, Texas. Women were selected for interview on the basis of wanting no more children and consistently professing either happiness (n=17) or unhappiness (n=10) at the prospect of pregnancy. Interviews were coded and analyzed following the principles of grounded theory. We found that it is possible for women to express happiness at the idea of pregnancy while simultaneously earnestly trying to prevent conception. Happiness at the idea of an unintended pregnancy was explained as the result of deep and heartfelt feelings about children taking precedence over practical considerations, the perception that the psychosocial stress resulting from another child would be low, and the ability to rationalize an unintended pregnancy as the result of fate or God's plan. The major exception to the sincerity of professed happiness was that conveyed as a result of social pressure despite truly negative feelings, predominantly expressed by foreign-born Latina women. Overall, equating incongruence with ambivalence about avoiding conception may undermine the sincerity of women's intentions and their desires for highly-effective contraception. At the same time, unintended pregnancies that are greeted with happiness may have different implications for maternal and child health outcomes compared to pregnancies that are greeted with unhappiness. Identifying which unintended pregnancies are most likely to result in adverse outcomes is a target for future research. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Ambivalence; Latina; Non-Hispanic white; Pregnancy feelings; Pregnancy intentions; Qualitative research; Unintended pregnancy; United states","Aiken, A.R.A., Potter, J.E., Are Latina women ambivalent about pregnancies they are trying to prevent?

However, the underlying mechanism of prenatal ethanol exposure causing heart malfunction is not well known. The current study examined the effect of prenatal and early postnatal ethanol consumption on heart abnormality resulting from oxidative and inflammatory stress. It was also intended to find out whether vitamin E inhibits the abnormality induced by ethanol in rats' heart tissue. Pregnant Wistar rats received ethanol with/without vitamin E from the seventh day of gestation (GD7) throughout lactation. The proliferation in heart muscle cells and coronary smooth muscle cells, protein carbonyl, IL-6, TNF-α, homocysteine levels, also lipid profile in heart and plasma of male pups were measured at the end of lactation (PN 21) and 90 days after birth (PN 90). The results indicated proliferation of heart muscle and coronary smooth muscle cells along with heart structural alteration, protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, inflammatory reaction, and hyperhomocysteinemia in offspring after 21 and 90 days of birth compared with the controls. Vitamin E treatment significantly decreased cell proliferation and heart structural alteration, compared with the group treated by ethanol alone. Furthermore, it reduced the elevation of protein carbonyl, lipid peroxidation, and increased inflammatory proteins to levels as those of the controls. These findings strongly support the idea that ethanol intake by dams during pregnancy and early postnatal days induces heart abnormality mediated by oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions, and that these effects can be alleviated by using vitamin E as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory molecule. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Ethanol; Heart; Pregnancy; Rat; Vitamin E","Jones, K.L., Smith, D.W., Recognition of the fetal alcohol syndrome in early infancy (1973) Lancet, 302, pp. 999-1001; Barr, H.M., Streissguth, A.P., Identifying maternal self-reported alcohol use associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (2001) Alcohol.

Unfortunately, a complete census of fetal deaths, an important measure of overall fetal health, is infeasible, and available data are selectively observed. We consider this issue in the context of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 (CAAA), one of the largest and most influential environmental regulations in the history of the United States. We discuss a model of potential bias in measuring observed fetal deaths, and present the sex ratio of live births as an alternative fetal health endpoint, taking advantage of the finding that males are more vulnerable to side effects of maternal stress in utero. We find the CAAA caused substantial improvements in fetal health, in addition to previously identified reductions in post-natal mortality. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental health; Environmental policy; Fetal and maternal health; Regression discontinuity; Sex ratios","Almond, D., Currie, J., Killing me softly: the fetal orgins hypothesis (2011) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 25 (3), pp. 153-172; Almond, D., Edlund, L., Trivers-Willard at birth and one year: evidence from US Natality Data 1983-2001 (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 274 (1624), pp. 2491-2496; Almond, D., Hoynes, H.W., Schanzenbach, D.W., Inside the war on poverty: the impact of food stamps on birth outcomes (2011) Review of Economics and Statistics, 93 (2), pp. 387-403; Almond, D., Edlund, L., Palme, M., (2007) Chernobyl's Subclinical Legacy: Prenatal Exposure to Radioactive Fallout and School Outcomes in Sweden, , NBER Working Paper 13347; Almond, D., Edlund, L., Palme, M., Chernobyl's subclinical legacy: prenatal exposure to radioactive fallout and school outcomes in Sweden (2009) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 124 (4), pp. 1729-1772; Almond, D., Edlund, L., Li, H., Zhang, J., (2007) Long-term Effects of the 1959-1961 China Famine: Mainland China and Hong Kong, , NBER Working Paper 13384; Ananat, E.O., Gruber, J., Levine, P., Abortion legalization and life-cycle fertility (2007) Journal of Human Resources, 42 (2), pp. 375-397; Angrist, J., How do sex ratios affect marriage and labor markets?

These deficits may be passed onto subsequent generations. We characterized the effects of being born small on maternal bone health during pregnancy; and aimed to characterize the contribution of the maternal environment and germ line effects to bone health in F2 offspring from mothers born small.Bilateral uterine vessel ligation (or sham) surgery was performed on female F0 WKY rats on gestational day 18 (term 22. days) to induce uteroplacental insufficiency and fetal growth restriction. Control and Restricted F1 female offspring were allocated to a non-pregnant or pregnant group. To generate F2 offspring, F1 females were allocated to either non-embryo or embryo transfer groups. Embryo transfer was performed on gestational day 1, where second generation (F2) embryos were gestated (donor-in-recipient) in either a Control (Control-in-Control, Restricted-in-Control) or Restricted (Control-in-Restricted, Restricted-in-Restricted) mother.Restricted F1 females were born 10-15% lighter than Controls. Restricted non-pregnant females had shorter femurs, reduced trabecular and cortical bone mineral contents, trabecular density and bone geometry measures determined by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) compared to non-pregnant Controls. Pregnancy restored the bone deficits that were present in F1 Restricted females.F2 non-embryo transfer male and female offspring were born of normal weight, while F2 embryo transfer males and females gestated in a Control mother (Control-in-Control, Restricted-in-Control) were heavier at birth compared to offspring gestated in a Restricted mother (Restricted-in-Restricted, Control-in-Restricted). Male F2 Restricted embryo groups (Restricted-in-Control and Restricted-in-Restricted) had accelerated postnatal growth. There was no transmission of bone deficits present at 35. days or 6. months in F2 offspring. Embryo transfer procedure had confounding effects preventing the separation of maternal environment and germ line contribution to outcomes.Deficits present in F1 non-pregnant Restricted females were absent during late gestation, indicating that pregnant F1 Restricted females experienced gains in bone. These beneficial maternal pregnancy adaptations may have prevented transmission of bone deficits to F2 offspring. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Bone; Embryo transfer; Growth restriction; PQCT; Pregnancy","Barker, D.J., Winter, P.D., Osmond, C., Margetts, B., Simmonds, S.J., Weight in infancy and death from ischaemic heart disease (1989) Lancet, 2, pp. 577-580;

Materials and methods: We conducted a longitudinal follow-up study of premature infants who received 0.625mg IVB therapy in addition to standard laser photocoagulation therapy. For comparison of the ophthalmological and neurological assessment outcomes of these infants, a control group was formed with 13 birth weight- and gestational age-matched infants who were treated with laser therapy alone for type 1 ROP. The neurological status of the study group and the control group was examined systematically, and neurodevelopmental evaluation was assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III). Results: A total of 18 eyes of 13 infants were included in the study. Anatomical success was obtained in 14 eyes (78%) and retinal detachment was observed in 4 eyes (22%). At two years of age, no significant difference was found in terms of spherical or cylindrical refractive errors compared to the control group. In control group, 2/13 patients' and in study group, 3/13 patients' neurological examinations were abnormal. No significant difference was found in the mean cognitive, language or motor BSID-III test scores of the groups. Conclusions: IVB appears to be useful for advanced ROP when laser treatment is precluded or not sufficient for preventing the progression of ROP. This pilot study indicates that IVB seems to contribute no further complications to the complications already present due to prematurity. © 2015 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","Antivascular endothelial growth factor; Bevacizumab; Retinopathy of prematurity","Quinn, G.E., Gilbert, C., Darlow, B.A., Zin, A., Retinopathy of prematurity: An epidemic in the making (2010) Chin Med J (Engl, 123, pp. 2929-2937; Kychenthal, A., Dorta, P., Katz, X., Zone i retinopathy of prematurity: Clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes (2006) Retina, 26, pp. S11-S15; O'keefe, M., Lanigan, B., Long, V.W., Outcome of zone i retinopathy of prematurity (2003) Acta Ophthalmol Scand, 81, pp. 614-616; Drenser, K.A., Trese, M.T., Capone, A., Jr., Aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity (2010) Retina, 30, pp. S37-S40; Stone, J., Itin, A., Alon, T., Pe'er, J., Gnessin, H., Chan-Ling, T., Development of retinal vasculature is mediated by hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) expression by neuroglia (1995) J Neurosci, 15, pp. 4738-4747; Micieli, J.A., Surkont, M., Smith, A.F., A systematic analysis of the off-label use of bevacizumab for severe retinopathy of prematurity (2009) Am J Ophthalmol, 148, pp. 536-543; Mintz-Hittner, H.A., Kennedy, K.A., Chuang, A.Z., Efficacy of intravitreal bevacizumab for stage 3+ retinopathy of prematurity (2011) N Engl J Med, 364, pp. 603-615. , Beat-Rop Cooperative Group; Hard, A.L., Hellström, A., On the use of antiangiogenetic medications for retinopathy of prematurity (2011) Acta Paediatr, 100, pp. 1063-1065; Darlow, B.A., Ells, A.L., Gilbert, C.E., Gole, G.A., Quinn, G.E., Are we there yet?.

Treatments for obesity include lifestyle modification, medications and surgery. Newer anti-obesity medications have been shown to be effective at inducing initial weight management in addition to successful long-term weight maintenance. Historically, weight management medications have been associated with public safety concerns that have resulted in the majority being withdrawn from the market or never receiving medicinal authorization. Recently, several countries have approved some newer generation weight management medications which may be beneficial to combat obesity. These medications have varying effects on cardiometabolic parameters, both positive and potentially negative. This review will outline the mechanisms of action of these medications and their implications for both diabetes and cardiovascular risks. © 2015, The Author(s).","Cardiometabolic risks; Medications; Weight management","http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/, WHO.

The relative plasticity hypothesis (RPH) predicts that switches between plastic ARTs are mediated by changes in steroid hormones. This has received much support in males, but little is known about the endocrine control of female ARTs. Here, using a free-living population of African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) over five breeding seasons, we tested whether females following different tactics differed in corticosterone and testosterone levels, as reported for male striped mice using ARTs, and in progesterone and oestrogen, which are important in female reproduction. Female striped mice employ three ARTs: communal breeders give birth in a shared nest and provide alloparental care, returners leave the group temporarily to give birth, and solitary breeders leave to give birth and do not return. We expected communal breeders and returners to have higher corticosterone, owing to the social stress of group-living, and lower testosterone than solitary breeders, which must defend territories alone. Solitary breeders had lower corticosterone than returners and communal breeders, as predicted, but testosterone and progesterone did not differ between ARTs. Oestrogen levels were higher in returners (measured before leaving the group) than in communal and solitary breeders, consistent with a modulatory role. Our study demonstrates hormonal differences between females following (or about to follow) different tactics, and provides the first support for the RPH in females. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Cooperative breeding; Endocrinology; Glucocorticoid; Oestrogen; Plural breeding; Single breeder; Social environment; Social flexibility; Social organisation; Sociality","Alonzo, S.H., Conflict between the sexes and alternative reproductive tactics within a sex (2008) Alternative Reproductive Tactics: An Integrative Approach, pp. 435-450. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, R.F.

The birth of the Soviet Jewry movement in the mid-1960s and its growth in the early 1970s prompted one such crisis, as Jewish students and women began to adopt the campaigning methods of contemporaneous New Left political activism to press the case for Soviet Jews. The response of the Board of Deputies to this challenge revealed a flexible and adaptive attitude toward political activism, and even a growing appetite for public campaigning, that belies some of the harsher criticism directed at the board by some historians of Anglo-Jewry. Tensions between the Anglo-Jewish establishment and grassroots activists were mirrored in the United States, indicating that concern about image and control was not a specifically British condition. Meanwhile, the desire of grassroots activists to gain political access to Westminster suggests that the dichotomy of quiet diplomacy versus public activism is too simplistic; rather, the two approaches complemented each other in efforts to generate public and political support for Soviet Jews. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Anglo-Jewry; Political activism; Soviet Jewry; Students; Women",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928684436

In the present study, we examined the effect of female body weight prior to spawning and fry birth weight on survival rates at 20days of nursing (D20) and at 62days (D62) (when tagged). Genetic parameters for D20 and D62 were estimated from 86,609 individual fry which were offspring of 63 sires and 77 dams in the sixth generation of a Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) population undergoing selection for high growth in brackish water environment. Both linear and threshold models were used to estimate genetic parameters for these two traits. The estimates of heritability for D20 after hatching were low and not significantly different from zero across the models studied. By contrast, D62 showed a large heritable additive genetic component on both the liability and observed scales (h2=0.24-0.79). The maternal and common environmental effects were 6-12% for survival at 20days (D20), whereas they were small for survival from 21days to tagging, D62 (1-5%). Genetic correlation between D20 and D62 was high and positive (0.72±0.06). However, the estimate was significantly different from one, which suggests that D20 and D62 are under different genetic control and should be treated as different traits in selective breeding programs for tilapia. The results from the present study indicate for the first time that there is potential for simultaneous improvement of both survival rates at 20days of nursing and at tagging in the future genetic improvement program for this tilapia population. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Brackish water and tilapia; Genetic correlation; Heritability; Survival","Andersen, T.B., Roll, K.H., Tveteras, S., The price responsiveness of salmon supply in the short and long run (2008) Mar.

Objectives To assess the efficacy of topical coconut oil applications among a cohort of hospital-born preterm infants. Design A prospective, individually randomised controlled clinical trial. Setting Nursery and neonatal intensive care unit at Aga Khan University Hospital, Pakistan. Participants Of 270 eligible neonates, a consecutive cohort of 258 hospital-born preterm infants (gestational age ≥26 weeks and ≤37 weeks). Intervention Twice daily topical application of coconut oil by nurses from birth until discharge and continued thereafter by mothers at home until completion of the 28th day of life. Primary outcome measures Incidence of hospitalacquired bloodstream infections. Secondary outcome measures Weight gain, skin condition and neonatal mortality. Results 23% of the enrolled neonates developed clinically suspected sepsis while 14% developed blood culture proven infection. The unadjusted hazard for developing hospital-acquired infection in the control group was 4.7 (95% CI 1.8 to 12.4) compared with the intervention group. After adjusting for gestational age, birth weight, duration of intubation and duration of hospitalisation for possible confounding, the hazard for hospital-acquired infection in the control group was 6.0 (95% CI 2.3 to 16) compared with the intervention group. The rate of hospital-acquired infections in the control and intervention groups was 219.1 and 39.5 per 1000 patient-days, respectively. Mean weight gain was 11.3 g/day higher (95% CI 8.1 to 14.6, p<0.0001) and average skin condition was signi ficantly better in the intervention group when compared with controls. There was no significant impact on duration of hospitalisation or neonatal mortality. No adverse effects such as local irritation or local infection were observed among newborns receiving coconut oil applications. Conclusions Topical emollient therapy was effective in maintaining skin integrity and reducing the risk of bloodstream infection in preterm infants in a tertiary hospital setting in Pakistan. The effectiveness of this approach in primary care settings needs to be further explored.",,"World Health Organisation, (2012) Born Too Soon: The Global Action Report on Preterm Birth, , Geneva: WHO; Lawn, J.E., Blencowe, H., Oza, S., Every Newborn: Progress, priorities, and potential beyond survival (2014) Lancet, 384, pp. 189-205; Bhutta, Z.A., Das, J.K., Bahl, R., Can available interventions end preventable deaths in mothers, newborn babies, and stillbirths, and at what cost?

Methods: During 1993–1999, pregnancies of women with type 1 diabetes in Denmark were prospectively reported to a central registry in the Danish Diabetes Association. Data included information on maternal demography, diabetes status and pregnancy outcome. We invited 746 eligible children from this cohort (index offspring) to a follow-up examination. Control offspring were identified through The Danish Central Office of Civil Registration and matched with respect to date of birth, sex and postal code. Anthropometric measurements and blood sampling for metabolic characterisation, including an oral glucose tolerance test, were performed. Results: We examined 278 index offspring (mean age 16.7 years; range 13.0–19.8 years) and 303 control offspring (mean age 16.8 years; range 13.5–20.4 years). Index offspring had higher BMI SD score (0.44: 95% CI 0.21, 0.66) compared with controls, after adjustments for pubertal development and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. Furthermore, index offspring had a higher prevalence of components included in metabolic syndrome and prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance), with reduced insulin sensitivity and relative insulin secretion deficiency, compared with controls. Maternal HbA<inf>1c</inf> levels in pregnancy were not directly associated with offspring metabolic outcomes. Conclusions/interpretation: Adolescent offspring of mothers with type 1 diabetes had a less favourable metabolic profile and higher frequency of prediabetes than the background population. Significant associations between these outcomes and maternal HbA<inf>1c</inf> levels in pregnancy could not be demonstrated.

Martin Avenue, Tucson, USA","Background: Nemaline myopathy (NM), the most common non-dystrophic congenital myopathy, is characterized by generalized skeletal muscle weakness, often from birth. To date, no therapy exists that enhances the contractile strength of muscles of NM patients. Mutations in NEB, encoding the giant protein nebulin, are the most common cause of NM. The pathophysiology of muscle weakness in NM patients with NEB mutations (NEB-NM) includes a lower calcium-sensitivity of force generation. We propose that the lower calcium-sensitivity of force generation in NEB-NM offers a therapeutic target. Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer that is approved for use in humans and has been developed to target cardiac muscle fibers. It exerts its effect through binding to slow skeletal/cardiac troponin C. As slow skeletal/cardiac troponin C is also the dominant troponin C isoform in slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers, we hypothesized that levosimendan improves slow-twitch muscle fiber strength at submaximal levels of activation in patients with NEB-NM. Methods: To test whether levosimendan affects force production, permeabilized slow-twitch muscle fibers isolated from biopsies of NEB-NM patients and controls were exposed to levosimendan and the force response was measured. Results: No effect of levosimendan on muscle fiber force in NEB-NM and control skeletal muscle fibers was found, both at a submaximal calcium level using incremental levosimendan concentrations, and at incremental calcium concentrations in the presence of levosimendan. In contrast, levosimendan did significantly increase the calcium-sensitivity of force in human single cardiomyocytes. Protein analysis confirmed that the slow skeletal/cardiac troponin C isoform was present in the skeletal muscle fibers tested. Conclusions: These findings indicate that levosimendan does not improve the contractility in human skeletal muscle fibers, and do not provide rationale for using levosimendan as a therapeutic to restore muscle weakness in NEB-NM patients. We stress the importance of searching for compounds that improve the calcium-sensitivity of force generation of slow-twitch muscle fibers. Such compounds provide an appealing approach to restore muscle force in patients with NEB-NM, and also in patients with other neuromuscular disorders. © 2015 de Winter et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Calcium-sensitizer; Levosimendan; Muscle force; Muscle mechanics; Nebulin; Nemaline myopathy",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928783670

Sixty women with FGR and twenty with normal singleton pregnancy were enrolled during their third trimester. Infants were followed up for 6 months. Blood samples were obtained from pregnant women during the third trimester; cord blood samples were also taken. Six months after birth, blood samples were obtained from infants. Demographic and baseline characteristics were compared between groups. Birth weight, length and head circumference of neonates in the FGR group were lower than those in the control group. Total serum IgE level was significantly increased in third-trimester pregnant women with FGR compared with normal group (P < 0.05). However, this trend was not observed in the cord blood at birth or peripheral blood of 6-month-old infants. The prevalence of atopic eczema between the 2 groups was similar. Linear regression analysis revealed that the IgE level in the third trimester was negatively correlated with birth weight (P < 0.05). Higher serum IgE level in the cord blood was signifcantly associated with an increased risk of being small for gestational age (P < 0.05). In conclusion, IgE levels in the third trimester of pregnancy and cord blood are strongly related to birth outcomes of FGR. © FUNPEC-RP","Cohort study; Fetal growth restriction; Immunoglobulin E","Akinbami, L.J., Schoendorf, K.C., Trends in childhood asthma: Prevalence, health care utilization, and mortality (2002) Pediatrics, 110, pp. 315-322; Alanen, A., Serum IgE and smooth muscle antibodies in pre-eclampsia (1984) Acta Obstet.

Ivermectin was identified as an effective and safe anthelmintic in this species. Pups administered ivermectin had significantly higher erythrocyte counts and significantly lower eosinophil counts compared to controls at 1–2 months post-treatment, confirming that U. sanguinis and/or A. microchir are causatively associated with disease and demonstrating the positive effect of ivermectin treatment on clinical health parameters. Higher growth rates were not seen in ivermectin-treated pups and, unexpectedly, relatively older pups treated with ivermectin demonstrated significantly reduced growth rates when compared to matched saline-control pups. Differences in survival were not identified between treatment groups; however, this was attributed to the unexpectedly low mortality rate of recruited pups, likely due to the unintended recruitment bias towards pups >1–2 months of age for which mortality due to hookworm infection is less likely.

Preterm birth results in the early separation of the infant from the placenta and consequently a decline in blood and brain allopregnanolone concentrations. Progesterone therapy may increase allopregnanolone and lead to improved oligodendrocyte maturation. The objectives of this study were to examine the efficacy of progesterone replacement in augmenting allopregnanolone concentrations during the postnatal period and to assess the effect on cerebellar myelination – a region with significant postnatal development. Preterm guinea pig neonates delivered at 62 days of gestation by caesarean section received daily s.c. injections of vehicle (2-Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin) or progesterone (16 mg/kg) for 8 days until term-equivalent age (TEA). Term delivered controls (PND1) received vehicle. Neonatal condition/wellbeing was scored, and salivary progesterone was sampled over the postnatal period. Brain and plasma allopregnanolone concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay; cortisol and progesterone concentrations were determined by enzyme immunoassay; and myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), oligodendroctye transcription factor 2 (OLIG2) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα) were quantified by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Brain allopregnanolone concentrations were increased in progesterone-treated neonates. Plasma progesterone and cortisol concentrations were elevated in progesterone-treated male neonates. Progesterone treatment decreased MBP and PLP in lobule X of the cerebellum and total cerebellar OLIG2 and PDGFRα in males but not females at TEA compared with term animals. We conclude that progesterone treatment increases brain allopregnanolone concentrations, but also increases cortisol levels in males, which may disrupt developmental processes. Consideration should be given to the use of non-metabolizable neurosteroid agonists. © Cambridge University Press and the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease 2015","allopregnanolone; cortisol; neonate; oligodendrocyte; premature",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928391913

In this study, we analyzed short-term and sustainable effects of a prenatal versus early postnatal maternal high-protein diet on growth and hepatic gene expression in mouse offspring. Methods: Dams were exposed to an isoenergetic high-protein (HP, 40 % w/w) diet during pregnancy or lactation. Growth and hepatic expression profiles of male offspring were evaluated directly after weaning and 150 days after birth. Offspring from two dietary groups, high-protein diet during pregnancy and control diet during lactation (HPC), and control diet during pregnancy and high-protein diet during lactation (CHP), were compared with offspring (CC) from control-fed dams. Results: Maternal CHP treatment was associated with sustained offspring growth retardation, but decreased numbers of affected hepatic genes in adults compared to weanlings. In contrast, offspring of the HPC group did not show persistent effects on growth parameters, but the number of affected hepatic genes was even increased at adult age. In both dietary groups, however, only a small subset of genes was affected in weanlings as well as in adults. Conclusions: We conclude that (1) prenatal and early postnatal maternal HP diet caused persistent, but (2) different effects and partially complementary trends on growth characteristics and on the hepatic transcriptome and associated pathways and that (3) only a small number of genes and associated upstream regulators might be involved in passing early diet-induced imprints to adulthood. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","High-protein diet; Lactation; Microarray analysis; Pregnancy",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928318648

Study design: A retrospective case control study was conducted based on institutional electronic database and blood bank registry of a single center, 2005–2014. The major obstetric hemorrhage event was defined as transfusion of ≥5 red blood cells units within 48 h of birth and compared to matched group (ratio 1:4) based on the time of birth. Multivariable stepwise backward logistic regression models were fitted to determine risk factors for major obstetric hemorrhage. Odds ratio (OR), further evaluated by standard measures of the predictive accuracy of the logistic regression models, C statistics, and associated neonatal adverse outcome are reported. Results: 113,342 women delivered during the study; 122 (0.1 %) women experienced major obstetric hemorrhage. There was one major obstetric hemorrhage fatality (0.8 %). Compared to the controls, we identified historical as well as significant current modifiable risk factors for major obstetric hemorrhage: multifetal pregnancy (OR 3.92; 95 % CI 1.34–11.52; p = 0.013), induction of labor (OR 2.81; 95 % CI 1.22–7.05; p = 0.027), cesarean section (OR 25.56; 95 % CI 12.88–50.75; p < 0.001), and instrumental delivery (OR 6.58; 95 % CI 2.36–18.3; p < 0.001). C statistics of the model for major obstetric hemorrhage prediction was 0.919 (95 % CI 0.890–0.948, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Major obstetric hemorrhage is a rare event with potentially modifiable risk factors which represent a platform of interventions for lessening obstetric morbidity. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Emergent obstetrics; Hysterectomy; Maternal morbidity; Obstetric hemorrhage",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928319222

We examined whether dietary habits modify the association between occupational psychosocial factors and waist circumference.Subjects/Methods:Data comprised 31-year-old men (n=2222) and women (n=2053) in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966. Waist circumference was measured and data on occupational psychosocial factors (demands, control and social support) and other characteristics were obtained through questionnaires. Healthy and unhealthy diet indices were constructed according to the current dietary guidelines. Associations were examined using analysis of variance adjusted for body mass index at age 14, basic education level, leisure-time physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, stress-related eating behaviour and parity.Results:Among men, high job demands and high job control were associated with greater waist circumferences, and there were interactions between unhealthy diet and job demands (P=0.043) and job control (P=0.036) in relation to waist circumference. The waist of men with high demands or high control and low consumption of unhealthy foods (red/processed meat, hamburgers and pizzas, fried potatoes, sugar-sweetened soft drinks and white bread) was smaller than that of men with high demands or high control and high consumption of such foods. No associations were found among women.Conclusions:A diet based on the current dietary guidelines seems to cancel out the adverse effects of occupational psychosocial factors on waist circumference among young men.

We hypothesized that a maternal HF diet predisposes to offspring adiposity via a programmed increase in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids in the liver and hence increased substrate availability for liver TAG synthesis. We further hypothesized that programmed changes in offspring liver fatty acid metabolism are associated with increased liver expression of the lipogenic enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1). Female rats were maintained on a HF diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) prior to and throughout pregnancy and lactation. After birth, newborns were nursed by the same dam, and all offspring were weaned to control diet. Plasma and liver fatty acid compositions were determined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Fatty acid C16 desaturation indices of palmitoleic/palmitic and (vaccenic + palmitoleic)/palmitic and the C18 desaturation index of oleic/stearic were calculated. Liver protein abundance of SCD-1 was analyzed in newborns and adult offspring. Plasma and liver C16 desaturation indices were decreased in HF newborns, but increased in the adult offspring. Liver SCD-1 expression was increased in the HF adult offspring. These data show that the maternal HF diet during pregnancy and lactation increases offspring liver SCD-1 protein abundance and alters the liver C16 desaturase pathway. © 2015 AOCS","Monounsaturated fatty acid; Obesity; Rat; Saturated fatty acid; Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1; Triglyceride",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928138657

Experimental groups consisted of control (milk without yogurt) and groups fed milk containing 15% and 30% probiotic yogurt with pH values of either 3.8 or 4.5. Results showed that starter intake (SI) and dry matter intake (DMI) were not affected by dietary treatments throughout (except 4–7 d) the trial period. Partial substitution of probiotic yogurt resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) increase in SI compared with control calves at seventh and eighth weeks of trial. Also, using probiotic yogurt with pH of 4.5 increased (P < 0.05) SI when compared with pH value of 3.8 at the second trial week. On the other hand, DMI was significantly (P < 0.01) lower in yogurt-fed calves than milk group at seventh week of experiment.

Aggregating evidence demonstrates that genetic defects are involved in the pathogenesis of CHD. However, CHD is genetically heterogeneous and the genetic components underpinning CHD in an overwhelming majority of patients remain unclear. In the present study, the coding exons and flanking introns of the PITX2 gene, which encodes a paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2essential for cardiovascular morphogenesis as well as maxillary facial development, was sequenced in 196 unrelated patients with CHD and subsequently in the mutation carrier's family members available. As a result, a novel heterozygous PITX2 mutation, p.Q102X for PITX2a, or p.Q148X for PITX2b, or p.Q155X for PITX2c, was identified in a family with endocardial cushion defect (ECD) and Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS). Genetic analysis of the pedigree showed that the nonsense mutation co-segregated with ECD and ARS transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern with complete penetrance. The mutation was absent in 800 control chromosomes from an ethnically matched population. Functional analysis by using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system revealed that the mutant PITX2 had no transcriptional activity and that the mutation eliminated synergistic transcriptional activation between PITX2 and NKX2.5, another transcription factor pivotal for cardiogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the association of PITX2 loss-of-function mutation with increased susceptibility to ECD and ARS. The findings provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning ECD and ARS, suggesting the potential implications for the antenatal prophylaxis and personalized treatment of CHD and ARS. © 2015 Zhao et al.",,"Go, A.S., Mozaffarian, D., Roger, V.L., Benjamin, E.J., Berry, J.D., Blaha, M.J., Heart disease and stroke statistics - 2014 update: A report from the American Heart Association (2014) Circulation, 129, pp. e28-e292. , PMID: 24352519;

Therefore, guidance cues provide tight spatiotemporal control of axon growth and guidance. Mice lacking the guidance cue Semaphorin 3F (Sema3F) display very specific axon wiring deficits of motor neurons in the medial aspect of the lateral motor column (LMCm). While these deficits have been investigated extensively during embryonic development, it remained unclear how Sema3F mutant mice cope with these errors postnatally. We therefore investigated whether these animals provide a suitable model for the exploration of adaptive plasticity in a system of miswired neuronal circuitry. We show that the embryonically developed wiring deficits in Sema3F mutants persist until adulthood. As a consequence, these mutants display impairments in motor coordination that improve during normal postnatal development, but never reach wildtype levels. These improvements in motor coordination were boosted to wildtype levels by housing the animals in an enriched environment starting at birth. In contrast, a delayed start of enriched environment housing, at 4 weeks after birth, did not similarly affect motor performance of Sema3F mutants. These results, which are corroborated by neuroanatomical analyses, suggest a critical period for adaptive plasticity in neuromuscular circuitry. Interestingly, the formation of perineuronal nets, which are known to close the critical period for plastic changes in other systems, was not altered between the different housing groups. However, we found significant changes in the number of excitatory synapses on limb innervating motor neurons. Thus, we propose that during the early postnatal phase, when perineuronal nets have not yet been formed around spinal motor neurons, housing in enriched environment conditions induces adaptive plasticity in the motor system by the formation of additional synaptic contacts, in order to compensate for coordination deficits. © 2015 Helmbrecht et al.",,"Huber, A.B., Kolodkin, A.L., Ginty, D.D., Cloutier, J.F., Signaling at the growth cone: Ligand-receptor complexes and the control of axon growth and guidance (2003) Annual Review of Neuroscience, 26, pp. 509-563. , Epub 2003/04/05 PubMed PMID: 12677003; Egea, J., Klein, R., Bidirectional Eph-ephrin signaling during axon guidance (2007) Trends in Cell Biology., 17 (5), pp. 230-238. , PubMed PMID: 17420126; Kao, T.J., Law, C., Kania, A., Eph and ephrin signaling: Lessons learned from spinal motor neurons (2012) Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology., 23 (1), pp. 83-91. , PubMed PMID: 22040916; Kramer, E.R., Knott, L., Su, F., Dessaud, E., Krull, C.E., Helmbacher, F., Cooperation between GDNF/Ret and ephrinA/EphA4 signals for motor-axon pathway selection in the limb (2006) Neuron., 50 (1), pp. 35-47. , PubMed PMID: 16600854; Huber, A.B., Kania, A., Tran, T.S., Gu, C., De Marco Garcia, N., Lieberam, I., Distinct roles for secreted semaphorin signaling in spinal motor axon guidance (2005) Neuron., 48 (6), pp. 949-964. , Epub 2005/12/21 PubMed PMID: 16364899; Hensch, T.K., Critical period regulation (2004) Annual Review of Neuroscience, 27, pp. 549-579. , Epub 2004/ 06/26 PubMed PMID: 15217343; Wiesel, T.N., Hubel, D.H., Effects of visual deprivation on morphology and physiology of cells in the cats lateral geniculate body (1963) Journal of Neurophysiology, 26, pp. 978-993. , Epub 1963/11/01 PubMed PMID: 14084170; Thompson, W.J., Activity and synapse elimination at the neuromuscular junction (1985) Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology., 5 (1-2), pp. 167-182. , PubMed PMID: 3861262; Barkat, T.R., Polley, D.B., Hensch, T.K., A critical period for auditory thalamocortical connectivity (2011) Nat Neurosci., 14 (9), pp. 1189-1194. , Epub 2011/08/02 PubMed PMID: 21804538; PubMed Central PMCID: PMC3419581; Berardi, N., Pizzorusso, T., Ratto, G.M., Maffei, L., Molecular basis of plasticity in the visual cortex (2003) Trends in Neurosciences, 26 (7), pp. 369-378. , Epub 2003/07/10 PubMed PMID: 12850433; Hubel, D.H., Wiesel, T.N., The period of susceptibility to the physiological effects of unilateral eye closure in kittens (1970) The Journal of Physiology, 206 (2), pp. 419-436. , PubMed PMID: 5498493; PubMed Central PMCID: PMC1348655; Bengoetxea, H., Ortuzar, N., Bulnes, S., Rico-Barrio, I., Lafuente, J.V., Argandona, E.G., Enriched and deprived sensory experience induces structural changes and rewires connectivity during the postnatal development of the brain (2012) Neural Plasticity, , 2012:305693.

After the Term Breech Trial in 2000, VBB reduced and caesarean section for breech presentation increased. Despite this, women still request VBB. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences and decision-making processes of women who had sought a VBB. Methods: A qualitative study using descriptive exploratory design was undertaken. Twenty-two (n=22) women who planned a VBB, regardless of eventual mode of birth were recruited. The women had given birth at one of two maternity hospitals in Australia that supported VBB. In-depth, semi-structured interviews using an interview guide were conducted. Interviews were analysed thematically. Results: Twenty two women were interviewed; three quarters were primiparous (n=16; 73%). Nine (41%) were already attending a hospital that supported VBB with the remaining women moving hospitals. All women actively sought a vaginal breech birth because the baby remained breech after an external cephalic version - 12 had a vaginal birth (55%) and 10 (45%) a caesarean section after labour commenced. There were four main themes: Reacting to a loss of choice and control, Wanting information that was trustworthy, Fighting the system and seeking support for VBB and The importance of 'having a go' at VBB. Conclusions: Women seeking a VBB value clear, consistent and relevant information in deciding about mode of birth. Women desire autonomy to choose vaginal breech birth and to be supported in their choice with high quality care. © Homer et al.","Caesarean section; Experiences; Pregnancy; Qualitative; Vaginal breech birth","Phipps, H., Roberts, C.L., Nassar, N., Raynes-Greenow, C.H., Peat, B., Hutton, E.K., The management of breech pregnancies in Australia and New Zealand (2003) Aust N Z J Obstet Gynaecol, 43 (4), pp. 294-297; Hannah, M.E., Hannah, W.J., Hewson, S.A., Hodnett, E.D., Saigal, S., Willan, A.R., Planned caesarean section versus planned vaginal birth for breech presentation at term: a randomised multicentre trial (2000) Lancet, 356 (9239), pp. 1375-1383; Hogle, K., Kilburn, L., Hewson, S., Gafni, A., Wall, R., Hannah, M., Impact of the international term breech trial on clinical practice and concerns: a survey of centre collaborators (2003) J Obstet Gynaecol Can, 25 (1), pp. 14-16; Vlemmix, F., Bergenhenegouwen, L., Schaaf, J., Ensing, S., Rosman, A., Ravelli, A., Term breech deliveries in the Netherlands: did the increased cesarean rate affect neonatal outcome? a population-based cohort study (2014) Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand, 93 (9), pp. 888-896; Bogner, G., Xu, F., Simbrunner, C., Bacherer, A., Reisenberger, K., Single-institute experience, management, success rate and outcome after external cephalic version (2012) Int J Gynecol Obstet, 116, pp. 134-137; Cluver, C., Hofmeyr, G.J., Gyte, G.M., Sinclair, M., Interventions for helping to turn term breech babies to head first presentation when using external cephalic version (2012) Cochrane Database Syst Rev., 1. , CD000184; Kotaska, A., Menticoglou, S., Gagnon, R., Vaginal delivery of breech presentation: SOGC clinical practice guideline (2009) J Obstet Gynaecol Can, 31 (6), pp. 557-566; Hogle, K.L., Hutton, E.K., McBrien, K.A., Barrett, J.F., Hannah, M.E., (2003) Cesarean delivery for twins: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

The development of hybrid mesoporous silica with complex tailored pore nanoarchitectures bridges the gap between molecular materials and the requirements of nanodevices for controlled nanoscale chemistry. In the last decade, membranes, particles and thin film porous architectures have been designed, synthesized and selectively modified by molecular, polymeric, organometallic or biologically active groups. The exquisite manipulation of mesopore morphology and interconnection combined with molecular or supramolecular functionalities, and the intrinsic biological compatibility of silica have made these materials a potential platform for selective sensing and drug delivery. The wide répertoire of these hard-soft architectures permit us to envisage sophisticated intelligent nano-systems that respond to a variety of external stimuli such as pH, redox potential, molecule concentration, temperature, or light. Transduction of these stimuli into a predefined response implies exploiting spatial and physico-chemical effects such as charge distribution, steric constraints, equilibria displacements, or local changes in ionic concentration, just to name a few examples. As expected, this ""positional mesochemistry"" can be only attained through the concerted control of assembly, surface tailoring and, confinement conditions, thus giving birth to a new class of stimuli-responsive materials with modulable transport properties. As a guiding framework the emerging field of ""gated nanochemistry"" offers methodologies and tools for building up stimuli-sensitive porous architectures equipped with switchable entities whose transport properties can be triggered at will. The gated nanoscopic hybrid materials discussed here not only herald a new era in the integrative design of ""smart"" drug delivery systems, but also give the reader a perspective of the promising future in the development of mesoporous platforms that can control mass transport on command through the combination of flexible supramolecular routes, with implications on health, environment and energy. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Soler-Illia, G.J.A.A., Azzaroni, O., (2011) Chem.

The aims of this study were to design a participatory antenatal care (ANC) strengthening intervention and assess the implementation process and effectiveness on quality of ANC in Jimma, Ethiopia. Methods: The intervention comprised trainings, supervisions, equipment, development of health education material, and adaption of guidelines. It was implemented at public facilities and control sites were included in the evaluation. Improved content of care (physical examinations, laboratory testing, tetanus toxoid (TT)-immunization, health education, conduct of health professionals, and waiting time) were defined as proximal project outcomes and increased quality of care (better identification of health problems and increased overall user satisfaction with ANC) were distal project outcomes. The process of implementation was documented in monthly supervision reports. Household surveys, before (2008) and after (2010) intervention, were conducted amongst all women who had given birth within the previous 12 months. The effect of the intervention was assessed by comparing the change in quality of care from before to after the intervention period at intervention sites, relative to control sites, using logistic mixed effect regression. Results: The continued attention to the ANC provision during implementation stimulated increased priority of ANC among health care providers. The organizational structure of the facilities and lack of continuity in care provision turned out to be a major challenge for implementation. There was a positive effect of the intervention on health education on danger signs during pregnancy (OR: 3.9, 95% CI: 2.6;5.7), laboratory testing (OR for blood tests other than HIV 2.9, 95% CI: 1.9;4.5), health problem identification (OR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1;3.1), and satisfaction with the service (OR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2;0.9). There was no effect of intervention on conduct of health professionals. The effect of intervention on various outcomes was significantly modified by maternal education. Conclusion: The quality of care can be improved in some important aspects with limited resources. Moreover, the study provides strategic perspectives on how to facilitate improved quality of ANC. © 2015 Villadsen et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Antenatal care (ANC); Complex interventions; Ethiopia; Health system strengthening; Maternal and child health; Process and effectiveness evaluation","(2007) Everybody Business: Strengthening Health Systems to Improve Health Outcomess, , WHO WHO's framework for action Geneva; Kerber, K.J., De Graft-Johnson, J.E., Bhutta, Z.A., Okong, P., Starrs, A., Lawn, J.E., Continuum of care for maternal, newborn, and child health: From slogan to service delivery (2007) Lancet, 370, pp. 1358-1369. , 17933651; Horton, R., What will it take to stop maternal deaths?

Our objective was to investigate the associations between maternal arsenic exposure, periconceptional folic acid supplementation, and risk of posterior neural tube defect (myelomeningocele) among a highly exposed population in rural Bangladesh. Methods: We performed a case-control study that recruited physician-confirmed cases from community health clinics served by Dhaka Community Hospital in Bangladesh, as well as local health facilities that treat children with myelomeningocele. Controls were selected from pregnancy registries in the same areas. Maternal arsenic exposure was estimated from drinking water samples taken from wells used during the first trimester of pregnancy. Periconceptional folic acid use was ascertained by self-report, and maternal folate status was further assessed by plasma folate levels measured at the time of the study visit. Results: Fifty-seven cases of myelomeningocele were identified along with 55 controls. A significant interaction was observed between drinking water inorganic arsenic and periconceptional folic acid use. As drinking water inorganic arsenic concentrations increased from 1 to 25 μg/L, the estimated protective effect of folic acid use declined (OR 0.22 to 1.03), and was not protective at higher concentrations of arsenic. No main effect of arsenic exposure on myelomeningocele risk was identified. Conclusions: Our study found a significant interaction between drinking water inorganic arsenic concentration from wells used during the first trimester of pregnancy and reported intake of periconceptional folic acid supplements. Results suggest that environmental arsenic exposure reduces the effectiveness of folic acid supplementation in preventing myelomeningocele. © 2015 Mazumdar et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Arsenic; Birth defect; Folate deficiency; Myelomeningocele; Neural tube defect","Volpe, J.J., (2008) Neurology of the Newborn, , 5 Saunders/Elsevier Philadelphia; Williams, J., Mai, C.T., Mulinare, J., Isenburg, J., Flood, T.J., Ethen, M., Updated estimates of neural tube defects prevented by mandatory folic Acid fortification - United States, 1995-2011 (2015) MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 64 (1), pp. 1-5; Li, Z., Ren, A., Zhang, L., Ye, R., Li, S., Zheng, J., Extremely high prevalence of neural tube defects in a 4-county area in Shanxi Province, China (2006) Birth Defects Res A Clin Mol Teratol, 76 (4), pp. 237-240. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD28XktlGisr4%3D; Agopian, A.J., Tinker, S.C., Lupo, P.J., Canfield, M.A., Mitchell, L.E., National birth defects prevention S: Proportion of neural tube defects attributable to known risk factors (2013) Birth Defects Res A Clin Mol Teratol, 97 (1), pp. 42-46. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38XhsleksbrE; Hill, D.S., Wlodarczyk, B.J., Finnell, R.H., Reproductive consequences of oral arsenate exposure during pregnancy in a mouse model (2008) Birth Defects Res B Dev Reprod Toxicol, 83 (1), pp. 40-47. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXjt1eitr8%3D; Beaudoin, A.R., Teratogenicity of sodium arsenate in rats (1974) Teratology, 10 (2), pp. 153-157. , 1:CAS:528:DyaE2MXis1OntA%3D%3D; Carpenter, S.J., Developmental analysis of cephalic axial dysraphic disorders in arsenic-treated hamster embryos (1987) Anat Embryol, 176 (3), pp. 345-365. , 1:STN:280:DyaL2szisVWisA%3D%3D; Han, Z.J., Song, G., Cui, Y., Xia, H.F., Ma, X., Oxidative stress is implicated in arsenic-induced neural tube defects in chick embryos (2011) Int J Dev Neurosci, 29 (7), pp. 673-680. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3MXht12jur%2FN; Hanlon, D.P., Ferm, V.H., Placental permeability of arsenate ion during early embryogenesis in the hamster (1977) Experientia, 33 (9), pp. 1221-1222. , 1:CAS:528:DyaE1cXhs1yjsA%3D%3D; Hill, D.S., Wlodarczyk, B.J., Mitchell, L.E., Finnell, R.H., Arsenate-induced maternal glucose intolerance and neural tube defects in a mouse model (2009) Toxicol Appl Pharmacol, 239 (1), pp. 29-36. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXptVCju7g%3D; Wlodarczyk, B.J., Zhu, H., Finnell, R.H., Mthfr gene ablation enhances susceptibility to arsenic prenatal toxicity (2014) Toxicol Appl Pharmacol, 275 (1), pp. 22-27. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXis1Cltrs%3D; Feng, Y., Wang, S., Chen, R., Tong, X., Wu, Z., Mo, X., Maternal folic Acid supplementation and the risk of congenital heart defects in offspring: A meta-analysis of epidemiological observational studies (2015) Sci Rep, 5, p. 8506; Smith, A.H., Lingas, E.O., Rahman, M., Contamination of drinking-water by arsenic in Bangladesh: A public health emergency (2000) Bull World Health Organ, 78 (9), pp. 1093-1103; Chakraborti, D., Rahman, M.M., Das, B., Murrill, M., Dey, S., Chandra Mukherjee, S., Status of groundwater arsenic contamination in Bangladesh: A 14-year study report (2010) Water Res, 44 (19), pp. 5789-5802. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3cXhsVOnsbzP; Dey, A.C., Shahidullah, M., Mannan, M.A., Noor, M.K., Saha, L., Rahman, S.A., Maternal and neonatal serum zinc level and its relationship with neural tube defects (2010) J Health Popul Nutr, 28 (4), pp. 343-350; Chen, Y., Ahsan, H., Parvez, F., Howe, G.R., Validity of a food-frequency questionnaire for a large prospective cohort study in Bangladesh (2004) Br J Nutr, 92 (5), pp. 851-859. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2cXhtVCjsbjO; Horne, D.W., Patterson, D., Lactobacillus casei microbiological assay of folic acid derivatives in 96-well microtiter plates (1988) Clin Chem, 34 (11), pp. 2357-2359; Rothman, K.J., Greenland, S., Matching (1998) Modern Epidemiology, pp. 147-161. , K.J.

The fetal inflammatory response to intra-amniotic (IA) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is orchestrated via interleukin 1 (IL-1). We aimed to determine if LPS induced contractile dysfunction in the preterm diaphragm is mediated via the IL-1 pathway. Pregnant ewes received IA injections of recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist (rhIL-1ra) (Anakinra; 100 mg) or saline (Sal) 3 h prior to second IA injections of LPS (4 mg) or Sal at 119d gestational age (GA). Preterm lambs were killed after delivery at 121d GA (term = 150 d). Muscle fibres dissected from the right hemi-diaphragm were mounted in an in vitro muscle test system for assessment of contractile function. The left hemi-diaphragm was snap frozen for molecular and biochemical analyses. Maximum specific force in lambs exposed to IA LPS (Sal/LPS group) was 25% lower than in control lambs (Sal/Sal group; p=0.025). LPS-induced diaphragm weakness was associated with higher plasma IL-6 protein, diaphragm IL-1β mRNA and oxidised glutathione levels. Pre-treatment with rhIL-1ra (rhIL-1ra/LPS) ameliorated the LPS-induced diaphragm weakness and blocked systemic and local inflammatory responses, but did not prevent the rise in oxidised glutathione. These findings indicate that LPS induced diaphragm dysfunction is mediated via IL-1 and occurs independently of oxidative stress. Therefore, the IL-1 pathway represents a potential therapeutic target in the management of impaired diaphragm function in preterm infants. © 2015 Karisnan et al.",,"Kallapur, S., Nitsos, I., Moss, T.J., Polglase, G.R., Pillow, J.J., Cheah, F.C., IL-1 mediates pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses to chorioamnionitis induced by lipopolysaccharide (2009) Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 179, pp. 955-961. , PMID: 19234101; Dimitriou, G., Greennough, A., Moxham, J., Rafferty, G.F., Influence of maturation on infant diaphragm function assessed by magnetic stimulation of phrenic nerves (2003) Pediatr Pulmonol, 35 (1), pp. 17-22. , PMID: 12461734; Keens, T., Bryan, A.C., Levison, H., Ianuzzo, C.D., Developmental pattern of muscle fiber types in human ventilatory muscles (1978) J Appl Physiol Respir Environ Exerc Physiol, 44 (6), pp. 909-913. , PMID: 149779; Maxwell, L., McCarter, R.J., Kuehl, T.J., Robotham, J.L., Development of histochemical and functional properties of baboon respiratory muscles (1983) J Appl Physiol Respir Environ Exerc Physiol, 54 (2), pp. 551-561. , PMID: 6833051; Lavin, T., Song, Y., Bakker, A.J., McLean, C.J., Macdonald, W.A., Pillow, J.J., Developmental changes in diaphragm muscle function and fibre type composition in the preterm lamb (2013) Pediatr Pulmonol, 48 (7), pp. 640-648. , PMID: 23401383; Javen, I., Williams, N.A., Young, I.R., Luff, A.R., Walker, D., Growth and differentiation of fast and slow muscles in fetal sheep, and the effects of hypophysectomy (1996) J Physiol, 494, pp. 839-849. , PMID: 8865079; Watchko, J.F., Sieck, G.C., Respiratory muscle fatigue resistance relates to myosin phenotype and SDH activity during development (1993) J Appl Physiol, 75, pp. 1341-1347. , PMID: 8226549; Sieck, G.C., Fournier, M., Blanco, C.E., Diaphragm muscle fatigue resistance during postnatal development (1991) J Appl Physiol, 71, pp. 458-464. , PMID: 1834623; Lesouef, P.N., England, S.J., Stogryn, H.A.F., Bryan, A.C., Comparison of diaphragmatic fatigue in newborn and older rabbits (1988) J Appl Physiol, 65, pp. 1040-1044. , PMID: 3182472; Romero, R., Espinoza, J., Gonçalves, L.F., Kusanovic, J.P., Friel, L., Hassan, S., The role of inflammation and infection in preterm birth (2007) Semin Reprod Med, 25 (1), pp. 21-39. , PMID: 17205421; Gotsch, F., Romero, R., Kusanovic, J.P., Mazaki-Tovi, S., Pineles, B.L., Erez, O., The fetal inflammatory response syndrome (2007) Clin Obstet Gynecol, 50 (3), pp. 652-683. , PMID: 17762416; Gomez, R., Romero, R., Ghezzi, F., Yoon, B.H., Mazor, M., Berry, S.M., The fetal inflammatory response syndrome (1998) Am J Obstet Gynecol, 179 (1), pp. 194-202. , PMID: 9704787; Reid, M., Lännergren, J., Westerblad, H., Respiratory and limb muscle weakness induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha: Involvement of muscle myofilaments (2002) Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 166 (4), pp. 479-484. , 15; Labbe, K., Danialou, G., Gvozdic, D., Demoule, A., Divangahi, M., Boyd, J.H., Inhibition of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 prevents diaphragmatic inflammation and maintains contractile function during endotoxemia (2010) Crit Care, 14 (5), p.

In this study, we aim to investigate the correlation between MTHFR polymorphisms and NTD-affected pregnancy. There were 444 participants involved in our study. Tag-SNPs were identified in HapMap Databases. Blood samples were collected from all subjects to further extract the genomic DNAs by TaqMan Blood DNA kits. We also carried out a meta-analysis based on previous published studies to further examine the association between MTHFR polymorphisms and NTD. In case–control study analysis, two SNPs were identified to be associated with NTD risk. The 677 C > T genetic variant was correlated with increased risk of NTD-affected pregnancy. However, the 1298 A > C polymorphism was shown to lower the risk of NTD-affected pregnancy. The protective role of 1298 A > C polymorphisms was further supported by the result of meta-analysis. Our study revealed that the SNPs of 677C > T and 1298A > C in MTHFR were associated with NTD-affected pregnancy, in which 677C > T was a risk factor and in contrast 1298A > C was protective factor against NTD. Our results of meta-analysis also revealed the 1298A > C MTHFR polymorphism play protective role in NTD. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; Folic acid cycle; Neural tube defects; Polymorphism",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927537299

Lurie Children's Hospital, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Department of PediatricsChicago, IL, United States","Background: With improved survival rates, short- and long-term respiratory complications of premature birth are increasing, adding significantly to financial and health burdens in the United States. In response, in May 2010, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) funded a 5-year $18.5 million research initiative to ultimately improve strategies for managing the respiratory complications of preterm and low birth weight infants. Using a collaborative, multi-disciplinary structure, the resulting Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program (PROP) seeks to understand factors that correlate with future risk for respiratory morbidity. Methods/Design: The PROP is an observational prospective cohort study performed by a consortium of six clinical centers (incorporating tertiary neonatal intensive care units [NICU] at 13 sites) and a data-coordinating center working in collaboration with the NHLBI. Each clinical center contributes subjects to the study, enrolling infants with gestational ages 23 0/7 to 28 6/7 weeks with an anticipated target of 750 survivors at 36 weeks post-menstrual age. In addition, each center brings specific areas of scientific focus to the Program. The primary study hypothesis is that in survivors of extreme prematurity specific biologic, physiologic and clinical data predicts respiratory morbidity between discharge and 1 year corrected age. Analytic statistical methodology includes model-based and non-model-based analyses, descriptive analyses and generalized linear mixed models. Discussion: PROP incorporates aspects of NICU care to develop objective biomarkers and outcome measures of respiratory morbidity in the <29 week gestation population beyond just the NICU hospitalization, thereby leading to novel understanding of the nature and natural history of neonatal lung disease and of potential mechanistic and therapeutic targets in at-risk subjects. © Pryhuber et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Bronchopulmonary dysplasia; Chronic lung disease; Infant; Prematurity; Preterm","Maitre, N.L., Ballard, R.A., Ellenberg, J.H., Davis, S.D., Greenberg, J.M., Hamvas, A., Respiratory consequences of prematurity: evolution of a diagnosis and development of a comprehensive approach.

Adequate periconceptional folic acid intake can prevent neural tube defects. Folate intake impacts blood folate concentration; however, the dose-response between natural food folate and blood folate concentrations has not been well described. We estimated this association among healthy females. A systematic literature review identified studies (1 1992–3 2014) with both natural food folate intake alone and blood folate concentration among females aged 12–49 years. Bayesian methods were used to estimate regression model parameters describing the association between natural food folate intake and subsequent blood folate concentration. Seven controlled trials and 29 observational studies met the inclusion criteria. For the six studies using microbiologic assay (MA) included in the meta-analysis, we estimate that a 6% (95% Credible Interval (CrI): 4%, 9%) increase in red blood cell (RBC) folate concentration and a 7% (95% CrI: 1%, 12%) increase in serum/plasma folate concentration can occur for every 10% increase in natural food folate intake. Using modeled results, we estimate that a natural food folate intake of ≥450 μg dietary folate equivalents (DFE)/day could achieve the lower bound of an RBC folate concentration (~1050 nmol/L) associated with the lowest risk of a neural tube defect. Natural food folate intake affects blood folate concentration and adequate intakes could help women achieve a RBC folate concentration associated with a risk of 6 neural tube defects/10,000 live births. © 2015, by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Food folate; RBC folate; Serum/plasma folate","National Institutes of Health: Office of Dietary Supplements Folate, , http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Folate-HealthProfessional/, (accessed on 4 September 2014); Institute of Medicine, (1998) Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline, , National Academy Press: Washington, DC, USA; Gibson, R.S., (2005) Principles of Nutritional Assessment, , 2nd ed.; Oxford University Press: New York, NY, USA; World Health Organization, (2013) Serum and Red Blood Cell Folate Concentrations for Assessing Folate Status in Populations, , World Health Organization: Geneva, Switzerland; Daly, L.E., Kirke, P.N., Molloy, A., Weir, D.G., Scott, J.M., Folate levels and neural tube defects: Implications for prevention (1995) JAMA, 274, pp. 1698-1702; Crider, K.S., Devine, O., Hao, L., Dowling, N.F., Li, S., Molloy, A.M., Li, Z., Berry, R.J., Population red blood cell folate concentrations for prevention of neural tube defects: Bayesian model (2014) BMJ, 349; Pfeiffer, C., Hughes, J.P., Lacher, D.A., Bailey, R.L., Berry, R.J., Zhang, M., Yetley, E.A., Johnson, C.L., Estimation of trends in serum and RBC folate in the U.S. population from pre- to postfortification using assay-adjusted data from the NHANES 1988-2010 (2012) J.

AF was analyzed for cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13 and IL-15, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-9 and MMP-12), and chemokines (complement factor-D/Adipsin, Serpin E1/PAI-1, Adiponectin/Acrp30, C-Reactive Protein, CCL2/MCP-1, Leptin, Resistin) using multiplex immunoassay kits. The association between AF protein levels and subsequent early preterm birth were examined.Result:A total of 96 sets of twins were enrolled, including 17 early preterm birth cases and 79 term controls. AF concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, MMP-3, MMP-8 and MMP-9, and CCL2/MCP-1 were significantly higher in cases than controls. Among these analytes, the combination of AF IL-8 and MMP-9 values had the highest predictive value for early preterm birth. The risk was 8% (10/132) for IL-8&lt;1200 pg ml-1 and MMP-9&lt;1000 pg ml-1, 30% (15/50) for IL-8&gt;1200 pg ml-1 or MMP-9&gt;1000 pg ml-1, and 90% (9/10) for IL-8&gt;1200 pg ml-1 and MMP-9&gt;1000 pg ml-1 (P&lt;0.001).Conclusion:High concentrations of IL-8 and MMP-9 in mid-trimester AF in twins predicted well the risk of early preterm birth.Journal of Perinatology advance online publication, 9 April 2015; doi:10.1038/jp.2015.29. © 2015 Nature America, Inc.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927551390

Maternal sociodemographic and infant-related factors were also investigated.Result:PTSD was present in 25 and 9% of NICU mothers and controls, respectively. We identified four PTSD patterns: none, persistent, delayed and recovered. The postpartum PTSD course was associated with trait anxiety. Whether the infant was the first child who predicted PTSD at year 1 (adjusted odds ratio=7.62, 95% confidence interval=1.07 to 54.52).Conclusion:Mothers of high-risk infants can develop early or late PTSD, and its course can be influenced by factors besides medical status.

A large number of infant deaths can be averted by appropriate management of low birth weight babies and prevention of factors associated with low birth weight. The prevalence of low birth weight babies in Nepal is estimated to be about 12-32%.Our study aimed at identifying major determinants of low birth weight among term babies in Nepal. A hospital-based retrospective case control study was conducted in maternity ward of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital from February to July 2011. A total of 155 LBW babies and 310 controls were included in the study. Mothers admitted to maternity ward during the study period were interviewed, medical records were assessed and anthropometric measurements were done. Risk factors, broadly classified into proximal and distal factors, were assessed for any association with birth of low-birth weight babies. Regression analysis revealed that a history of premature delivery (adjusted odds ratio; aOR5.24, CI 1.05-26.28), hard physical work during pregnancy (aOR1.48, CI 0.97-2.26), younger age of mother (aOR1.98, CI 1.15-3.41), mothers with haemoglobin level less than 11gm/dl (aOR0.51, CI0.24-1.07) and lack of consumption of nutritious food during pregnancy (aOR1.99, CI 1.28-3.10) were significantly associated with the birth of LBW babies. These factors should be addressed with appropriate measures so as to decrease the prevalence of low birth weight among term babies in Nepal. © 2015 Sharma et al.",,"Wilcox, A.J., On the importance-and the unimportance-of birthweight (2001) International Journal of Epidemiology, 30, pp. 1233-1241. , PMID: 11821313; Ashworth, A., Effects of intrauterine growth retardation on mortality and morbidity in infants and young children (1998) Eur J Clin Nutr, 52, pp. S34-S41. , PMID: 9511018, discussionS41-discussionS132; McIntire, D.D., Bloom, S.L., Casey, B.M., Leveno, K.J., Birth Weight in Relation to Morbidity and Mortality among Newborn Infants (1999) New England Journal of Medicine, 340, pp. 1234-1238. , PMID: 10210706; Lira, P.I., Ashworth, A., Morris, S.S., Low birth weight and morbidity from diarrhea and respiratory infection in northeast Brazil (1996) J Pediatr, 128, pp. 497-504. , PMID: 8618183; Read, J.S., Clemens, J.D., Low birthweight as a determinant of infectious disease mortality:A methodological evaluation (1995) Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol, 9, pp. 351-362. , PMID: 7479283; Victora, C.G., Smith, P.G., Vaughan, J.P., Nobre, L.C., Lombardi, C., Infant feeding and deaths due to diarrhea.

Methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scielo, and Conference abstracts, looking for randomized controlled studies (RCT). High heterogeneity (i2 &gt; 50 %) was corrected with random models. All studies were analyzed according to their quality and risk of bias. Nulliparous women or women whose previous pregnancy ended before 21 weeks’ gestation were included and the main outcome measures were: episiotomy rates, perineal tears, severe (3rd/4th) perineal tears, and intact perineum. Results: Five studies were included (1,369 participants) for systematic review and two of them (932 participants) were eligible for meta-analysis. Epi-No did not reduce episiotomy rates (RR 0.92 [95%CI 0.75–1.13], n = 710, p =0.44; two studies; fixed model) and second stage of labor (MD −12.50 [95%CI −29.62, –4.62], n = 162, p = 0.54; one study; fixed model), and did not increase intact perineum (RR 1.15 [95 % CI 0.81–1.64], n = 705, p = 0.43; two studies; random model). No influence of Epi-No on reducing all perineal tears (RR 0.99 [95%CI 0.84–1.17], n = 705, p = 0.93, two studies; fixed model) or severe (3rd/4th) perineal tears (RR 1.31 [95%CI 0.72–2.37], n = 705, p = 0.38, two studies; fixed model). Mean birthweight of the Epi-No group was higher than that of the control group in both studies, with no statistical significance. Conclusion: Epi-No birth trainer is a device that did not reduce episiotomy rates and had no influence on reducing perineal tears. © 2015 The International Urogynecological Association","Epi-No; Episiotomy; Perineal trauma; Systematic review",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927544660

There are few published studies on Plasmodium vivax-induced malaria in pregnancy. Ultrasound is an efficient method for evaluating foetal biometry and placenta. The present study aimed to investigate the occurrence of increased placental thickness, foetal biometry and the amniotic fluid via ultrasound in a cohort of pregnant women with vivax malaria in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Methods: A cohort study was conducted among 118 pregnant women with vivax malaria and 191 pregnant women without malaria. Foetal biometry, placental thicknesses and the amniotic fluid were evaluated via ultrasound. Biometric data were distributed by the trimester in which the infection occurred and converted to Z scores. The results were compared between the groups. Results: Among pregnant women from the cohort, increased placental thickness was observed in ten women with malaria (8.5 vs 0%; p <0.001). The Z scores of biometric parameters were not statistically significant when comparing the groups or according to the time of infection. In ultrasound results of the 118 pregnant women with malaria, seven (6%) showed low foetal weight, two (1.7%) showed oligohydramnios and one (0.85%) showed foetal malformation. There was no significant difference when these variables were compared to those of the control group. Conclusions: The placental thickness changes were significant but caused no foetal repercussions at birth. The ultrasound findings except placental thickness were similar in both groups, possibly because this is a low-endemic area and the pregnant women in the study were followed up in an active detection system that allowed early diagnosis and treatment of new malaria episodes. © 2015 Brock et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Amazon; Malaria; Placental thickness; Pregnancy; Ultrasonography; Vivax","(2012) World Malaria Report, p. 238. , http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2012/en/, WHO Geneva, Switzerland, World Health Organization; Jacinto, S.O., Silva, K., Pamplona, M.S., (2010) Gestação de Alto Risco: Manual Técnico, , http://bvsms.saude.gov.br/bvs/publicacoes/gestacao_alto_risco.pdf, 5th edition.

The study included 16 infants of both sexes, born at a mean gestational age of 32.13 (±1.36) weeks and mean birth weight of 1720.94 (±358.46) g. The infants were randomly divided into 2 groups: experimental and control. The experimental group was given a 5-min training session in reaching, while the control group received no training. The results showed significant differences in peak velocity in the intra (Z = –2.10, p = .036) and intergroup (U = 9.00, p = .016) evaluations, which decreased in the experimental group after training. Cohen's d test for clinical relevance suggested that the specific, short duration training proved effective in promoting slower reaches, with greater adjustment and lower number of units of movement. These results are positive for preterm infants given that these parameters more closely resemble the typical development of mature reaching behaviors in term infants, which suggests that this protocol of reaching training (serial varied practice) could be used as an evidence-based intervention strategy. 2015 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC","kinematics; preterm infant; reaching; training",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928252769

This is a case-control study carried out in three hospitals, and PPCM patients were followed up for six months. Critically low serum selenium concentration was defined as <70 μg/L. A total of 39 PPCM patients and 50 controls were consecutively recruited after satisfying the inclusion criteria. Mean serum selenium in patients (61.7 ± 14.9 μg/L) was significantly lower than in controls (118.4 ± 45.6 μg/L) (p < 0.001). The prevalence of serum selenium <70 μg/L was significantly higher among patients (76.9%) than controls (22.0%) (p < 0.001). The mean ceruloplasmin and prevalence of socio-economic indices, multiparity, pregnancy-induced hypertension, obesity and twin pregnancy were not different between the groups (p > 0.05). Logistic regression showed that rural residency significantly increased the odds for serum selenium <70 μg/L by 2.773-fold (p = 0.037). Baseline serum levels of selenium and ceruloplasmin were not associated with six-month mortality. This study has shown that selenium deficiency is a risk factor for PPCM in Kano, Nigeria, and is related to rural residency. However, serum ceruloplasmin, customary birth practices and some other characteristics were not associated with PPCM in the study area. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Ceruloplasmin; Heart failure; Peripartum cardiomyopathy; Risk factors; Selenium deficiency","Karaye, K.M., Saidu, H., Bala, M.S., Yahaya, I.A., Prevalence, clinical characteristics and outcome of pulmonary hypertension among admitted heart failure patients (2013) Ann.

We aimed to determine changes in the incidence of NT, characterize and investigate the associated risk factors and mortality in a prospective cohort study including all admissions over a 15-year period at a County hospital on the Kenyan coast, a region with relatively high historical NT rates within Kenya. Methods We assessed all neonatal admissions to Kilifi County Hospital in Kenya (1999-2013) and identified cases of NT (standard clinical case definition) admitted during this time. Poisson regression was used to examine change in incidence of NT using accurate denominator data from an area of active demographic surveillance. Logistic regression was used to investigate the risk factors for NT and factors associated with mortality in NT amongst neonatal admissions. A subset of sera from mothers (n = 61) and neonates (n = 47) were tested for anti-tetanus antibodies. Results There were 191 NT admissions, of whom 187 (98%) were home deliveries. Incidence of NT declined significantly (Incidence Rate Ratio: 0.85 (95% Confidence interval 0.81-0.89), P<0.001) but the case fatality (62%) did not change over the study period (P = 0.536). Younger infant age at admission (P = 0.001) was the only independent predictor of mortality. Compared to neonatal hospital admittee controls, the proportion of home births was higher among the cases. Sera tested for antitetanus antibodies showed most mothers (50/61, 82%) had undetectable levels of antitetanus antibodies, and most (8/9, 89%) mothers with detectable antibodies had a neonate without protective levels. Conclusions Incidence of NT in Kilifi County has significantly reduced, with reductions following immunisation campaigns. Our results suggest immunisation efforts are effective if sustained and efforts should continue to expand coverage. © 2015 Ibinda et al.",,"Bagcchi, S., Tetanus vaccination during pregnancy reduces risk of neonatal mortality in India, study finds (2013) BMJ, 347, p. f5808. , PMID: 24068726; Dietz, V., Milstien, J.B., VanLoon, F., Cochi, S., Bennett, J., Performance and potency of tetanus toxoid: Implications for eliminating neonatal tetanus (1996) Bull World Health Organ, 74, pp. 619-628. , PMID: 9060223; Liu, L., Oza, S., Hogan, D., Perin, J., Rudan, I., Global, Regional, and National Causes of Child Mortality in 2000-13, with Projections to Inform Post-2015 Priorities: An Updated Systematic Analysis (2014) Lancet; Lawn, J.E., Cousens, S., Zupan, J., Lancet Neonatal Survival Steering, T., 4 million neonatal deaths: When?

We aimed to evaluate the burden of invasive early-onset (0-6 days of life, EOD) and late-onset (7-89 days, LOD) GBS disease and subsequent neurological sequelae in infants from a setting with a high prevalence (29.5%) of HIV among pregnant women. Methods: A case-control study was undertaken at three secondary-tertiary care public hospitals in Johannesburg. Invasive cases in infants <3 months age were identified by surveillance of laboratories from November 2012 to February 2014. Neurodevelopmental screening was done in surviving cases and controls at 3 and 6 months of age. Results: We identified 122 cases of invasive GBS disease over a 12 month period. Although the incidence (per 1,000 live births) of EOD was similar between HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants (1.13 vs. 1.46; p = 0.487), there was a 4.67-fold (95%CI: 2.24-9.74) greater risk for LOD in HIV-exposed infants (2.27 vs. 0.49; p <0.001). Overall, serotypes Ia, Ib and III constituted 75.8% and 92.5%of EOD and LOD, respectively. Risk factors for EOD included offensive draining liquor (adjusted Odds Ratio: 27.37; 95%CI: 1.94-386.50) and maternal GBS bacteriuria (aOR: 8.41; 95%CI: 1.44-49.15), which was also a risk-factor for LOD (aOR: 3.49; 95%CI: 1.17-10.40). The overall case fatality rate among cases was 18.0%. The adjusted odds for neurological sequelae at 6 months age was 13.18-fold (95%CI: 1.44-120.95) greater in cases (13.2%) than controls (0.4%). Discussion: The high burden of invasive GBS disease in South Africa, which is also associated with high case fatality rates and significant neurological sequelae among survivors, is partly due to the heightened risk for LOD in infants born to HIV-infected women. An effective trivalent GBS conjugate vaccine targeted at pregnant women could prevent invasive GBS disease in this setting. © 2015 Dangor et al.",,"Oestergaard, M.Z., Inoue, M., Yoshida, S., Mahanani, W.R., Gore, F.M., Cousens, S., Neonatal mortality levels for 193 countries in 2009 with trends since 1990: A systematic analysis of progress, projections, and priorities (2011) PLOS Med, 8 (8), p. e1001080. , PMID: 21918640;

Enhanced level of LPx was observed in transient hypothyroid rats with respect to control and persistent hypothyroid rats. Significantly increased activity of SOD and expression of SOD1 were observed in cerebral cortex of both persistent and transient hypothyroid rats as compared to control. However, unaltered translated level of SOD2 was observed among the groups. Activity of CAT was increased in transient hypothyroid rats, whereas translate level of CAT was increased in both the regions of persistent as well as transient hypothyroidism. The histoarchitecture of cerebral cortex clearly showed a decline in neuronal migration with neurons packed together in both persistent and transient hypothyroid rats as compared to control. These results suggest that deprivation of thyroid hormone modulates redox status and causes oxidative stress in rat brain cerebral cortex during postnatal development and maturation. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Italia","Antioxidant enzymes; Cerebral cortex; Oxidative stress; Postnatal hypothyroidism; Rat brain",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926675416

The EUROCAT (European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies) cluster monitoring system and results are described here. Monitoring was conducted annually from 2007 to 2013 for 18 registries covering an annual birth population up to 0.5 million births. For each registry and 72 anomaly subgroups, the scan “moving window” technique was used to detect clusters in time occurring within the last 2 years based on estimated date of conception. Registries conducted preliminary investigations using a standardised protocol to determine whether there was cause for concern, and expert review was used at key points. 165 clusters were detected, a rate of 3.4 % of all 4823 cluster tests performed over 7 years, more than expected by chance. Preliminary investigations of 126 new clusters confirmed that 35 % were an unusual aggregation of cases, while 56 % were explained by data quality or diagnostic issues, and 9 % were not investigated. For confirmed clusters, the registries’ course of action was continuing monitoring. Three confirmed clusters continued to grow in size for a limited period in subsequent monitoring. This system is best suited to early detection of exposures which are sudden, widespread and/or highly teratogenic, and was reassuring in demonstrating an absence of a sustained exposure of this type. Such proactive monitoring can be run efficiently without overwhelming the surveillance system with false positives, and serves an additional purpose of data quality control. © 2015 The Author(s)","Clusters; Congenital anomalies; Surveillance",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926363442

It depends on various process parameters like plate thickness, current, voltage, type of weld joint and restraints put on. If distortion is not properly dealt during welding then the product may become useless from geometric accuracy point of view. In the present study, a 3-D coupled transient thermal analysis model with auxiliary side heating (parallel heating) is developed to control angular distortion. During analysis, parallel heating flames are placed at several locations from weld line in cross direction. A user defined subroutine is used to apply transient heat source and side heating flames. Element birth and death technique is used to simulate the filler material deposition. One side multipass ‘V’ butt weld configuration is used for this study. A series of observational tests are done with a special experimental fixture using Manual Metal Arc Welding (MMAW) to validate the proposed FEA model. It is found that the angular distortion has decreased from 2 mm to 0.4 mm with change in side heating distance from 50 to 90 mm from the weld line. © 2015 Indian Academy of Sciences","angular distortions.; element birth and death method; finite element analysis; manual metal arc welding; Side heating",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926162309

With the aid support vector machine (SVM) classification methods we aimed to investigate whether MRI data, collected in adolescence, could be used to predict whether an individual had been born preterm or at term. To this end we collected T1-weighted anatomical MRI data from 143 individuals (69 controls, mean age 14.6y). The inclusion criteria for those born preterm were birth weight ≤ - 1500g and gestational age < 37w. A linear SVM was trained on the grey matter segment ofMR images in two different ways. First, all the individuals were used for training and classification was performed by the leave-one-out method, yielding 93%correct classification (sensitivity = 0.905, specificity = 0.942). Separately, a random half of the available data were used for training twice and each time the other, unseen, half of the data was classified, resulting 86%and 91%accurate classifications. Both gestational age (R = -0.24, p<0.04) and birth weight (R = -0.51, p < 0.001) correlated with the distance to decision boundary within the group of individuals born preterm. Statistically significant correlations were also found between IQ (R = -0.30, p < 0.001) and the distance to decision boundary. Those born small for gestational age did not form a separate subgroup in these analyses. The high rate of correct classification by the SVM motivates further investigation. The long-term goal is to automatically and non-invasively predict the outcome of preterm-born individuals on an individual basis using as early a scan as possible. © 2015 Chu et al.",,"Huppi, P.S., Maier, S.E., Peled, S., Zientara, G.P., Barnes, P.D., Jolesz, F.A., Microstructural development of human newborn cerebral white matter assessed in vivo by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (1998) Pediatr Res, 44 (4), pp. 584-590. , PMID: 9773850;

Timely and accurate measurements of levels and trends in key health indicators at local levels are crucial to assess progress and identify drivers of success and areas that may be lagging behind. Methods: We generated estimates of 17 key maternal and child health indicators for Zambia's 72 districts from 1990 to 2010 using surveys, censuses, and administrative data. We used a three-step statistical model involving spatial-temporal smoothing and Gaussian process regression. We generated estimates at the national level for each indicator by calculating the population-weighted mean of the district values and calculated composite coverage as the average of 10 priority interventions. Results: National estimates masked substantial variation across districts in the levels and trends of all indicators. Overall, composite coverage increased from 46% in 1990 to 73% in 2010, and most of this gain was attributable to the scale-up of malaria control interventions, pentavalent immunization, and exclusive breastfeeding. The scale-up of these interventions was relatively equitable across districts. In contrast, progress in routine services, including polio immunization, antenatal care, and skilled birth attendance, stagnated or declined and exhibited large disparities across districts. The absolute difference in composite coverage between the highest-performing and lowest-performing districts declined from 37 to 26 percentage points between 1990 and 2010, although considerable variation in composite coverage across districts persisted. Conclusions: Zambia has made marked progress in delivering maternal and child health interventions between 1990 and 2010; nevertheless, substantial variations across districts and interventions remained. Subnational benchmarking is important to identify these disparities, allowing policymakers to prioritize areas of greatest need. Analyses such as this one should be conducted regularly and feed directly into policy decisions in order to increase accountability at the local, regional, and national levels. © Colson et al.","Coverage; Indicators; Inequalities; Maternal and child health; Subnational benchmarking; Zambia","Open working group proposal for sustainable development goals https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgsproposalO'Connell, T., Rasanathan, K., Chopra, M., What does universal health coverage mean?

This study examined whether this clinical group has more problems with visual-motor integration, motor coordination, and visual perception compared to term-born controls, and related these findings to cortical surface area and thickness and white matter fractional anisotropy. Forty-seven preterm-born very low birth weight individuals and 56 term-born controls were examined at 18-22years of age with a combined cognitive, morphometric MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging evaluation in Trondheim, Norway. Visual-motor skills were evaluated with the Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration-V (VMI) copying test and its supplemental tests of motor coordination and visual perception. 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE images and diffusion tensor imaging were done at 1.5T. Cortical reconstruction generated in FreeSurfer and voxelwise maps of fractional anisotropy calculated with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics were used to explore the relationship between MRI findings and cognitive results. Very low birth weight individuals had significantly lower scores on the copying and motor coordination tests compared with controls. In the very low birth weight group, VMI scores showed significant positive relationships with cortical surface area in widespread regions, with reductions of the superior temporal gyrus, insula, and medial occipital lobe in conjunction with the posterior ventral temporal lobe. Visual perception scores also showed positive relationships with cortical thickness in the very low birth weight group, primarily in the lateral occipito-temporo-parietal junction, the superior temporal gyrus, insula, and superior parietal regions. In the very low birth weight group, visual-motor performance correlated positively with fractional anisotropy especially in the corpus callosum, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus bilaterally, and anterior thalamic radiation bilaterally, driven primarily by an increase in radial diffusivity. VMI scores did not demonstrate a significant relationship to cortical surface area, cortical thickness, or diffusion measures in the control group. Our results indicate that visual-motor integration problems persist into adulthood for very low birth weight individuals, which may be due to structural alterations in several specific gray-white matter networks. Visual-motor deficits appear related to reduced surface area of motor and visual cortices and disturbed connectivity in long association tracts containing visual and motor information. We conjecture that these outcomes may be due to perinatal brain injury or aberrant cortical development secondary to injury or due to very preterm birth. © 2015 .","Cohort study; DTI; Morphometry; Very low birth weight; Visual-motor","Aarnoudse-Moens, C.S.H., Smidts, D.P., Oosterlaan, J., Duivenvoorden, H.J., Weisglas-Kuperus, N., Executive function in very preterm children at early school age (2009) J.

Cross-sectional and short time-series studies have found that higher income inequality is associated with higher IMR at the state level. Yet, descriptively, the longer-term trends in income inequality and in IMR seem to call such results into question. To assess whether, over the period 1990-2007, state-level income inequality is associated with state-level IMR; to examine whether the overall effect of income inequality on IMR over this period varies by state; to test whether the association between income inequality and IMR varies across this time period. IMR data - number of deaths per 1000 live births in a given state and year - were obtained from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control Wonder database. Income inequality was measured using the Gini coefficient, which varies from zero (complete equality) to 100 (complete inequality). Covariates included state-level poverty rate, median income, and proportion of high school graduates. Fixed and random effects regressions were conducted to test hypotheses. Fixed effects models suggested that, overall, during the period 1990-2007, income inequality was inversely associated with IMR (β=-0.07, SE (0.01)). Random effects models suggested that when the relationship was allowed to vary at the state-level, it remained inverse (β=-0.05, SE (0.01)). However, an interaction between income inequality and time suggested that, as time increased, the effect of income inequality had an increasingly positive association with total IMR (β=0.009, SE (0.002)). The influence of state income inequality on IMR is dependent on time, which may proxy for time-dependent aspects of societal contex. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Income inequality; Infant mortality; Longitudinal analysis; Multilevel modeling; State-level; United states","Auger, N., Hamel, D., Martinez, J., Ross, N.A., Mitigating effect of immigration on the relation between income inequality and mortality: a prospective study of 2 million Canadians (2012) J.Epidemiol.

Materials and Methods The U.S. Natality Database from 2007 to 2010 was reviewed. Inclusion criteria were twin deliveries and gestational age of 37 to 42 weeks. Exclusion criteria were congenital anomalies and missing/incomplete data. Cases were subdivided by gestational age into early term, term, and late term. Singleton pregnancies matched by delivery time and location were selected as controls. Outcome variables included were low Apgar score, assisted ventilation, neonatal intensive care unit admission, surfactant/antibiotic use, seizures, and birth injury. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios according to gestational age and plurality, using singleton term as reference. Results A total of 220,169 twin and 270,540 singleton deliveries were identified. The risk of adverse neonatal outcomes for twins was higher than for singletons. For twins, the distribution of the risks of the composite of adverse neonatal outcomes was linear, being the lowest at early term and the highest at late term, whereas the distribution for singletons was u-shaped being lowest at term compared with early and late term. Conclusions Twins are at higher risk of suboptimal neonatal outcomes than singletons, but do better when delivered at early term rather than term or late term.

We studied the effect of a nurse home visiting program on child maltreatment among young disadvantaged families in the Netherlands. This study is the first to investigate the effects of this program outside of the United States. Methods We conducted a single blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial that compared usual care with the nurse home visitation program, which began during pregnancy and continued until the children's second birthdays, in 460 disadvantaged women who were pregnant for the first time and <26 years of age. The primary outcome was the existence of a report about the child from a child protecting services agency (CPS reports). Secondary outcome measures included home environment and child behavior. Results Two hundred twenty-three participants were assigned to the control group, and 237 were assigned to the intervention group. Three years after birth, 19% of the children in the control group had a CPS report. The 11 percent of children in the intervention group with CPS files was significantly lower (relative risk 0.91, p-value 0.04). At 24 months, the intervention group scored significantly better on the IT-HOME. At 24 months after birth, the children in the intervention group exhibited a significant improvement in internalizing behavior (relative risk 0.56, p-value 0.04) but no evidence of a difference from the control group in externalizing behavior (relative risk 0.71, p-value 0.12). Conclusion The number of CPS reports for the intervention group was significantly lower than that of the control group. Additionally, the long-term home environments were improved and internalizing behaviors of the children were lower in the intervention group. © 2015 Mejdoubi et al.",,"Felitti, M.D., Vincent, J., Anda, M.D., Robert, F., Nordenberg, M.D., Williamson, M.S., Relationship of childhood abuse and household dysfunction to many of the leading causes of death in adults: The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study (1998) American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 14, pp. 245-258; Gilbert, R., Widom, C.S., Browne, K., Fergusson, D., Webb, E., Janson, S., Burden and consequences of child maltreatment in high-income countries (2009) Lancet, 373, pp. 68-81. , PMID: 19056114; Gijzen, S., Boere-Boonekamp, M.M., L'Hoir, M.P., Need, A., Child mortality in the Netherlands in the past decades: An overview of external causes and the role of public health policy (2014) Journal of Public Health Policy, 35, pp. 43-59. , PMID: 24107788; Wekerle, C., Leung, E., Wall, A.M., MacMillan, H., Boyle, M., Trocme, N., The contribution of childhood emotional abuse to teen dating violence among child protective services-involved youth (2009) Child Abuse Negl, 33, pp. 45-58. , PMID: 19167066; Fang, X., Brown, D.S., Florence, C.S., Mercy, J.A., The economic burden of child maltreatment in the United States and implications for prevention (2012) Child Abuse & Neglect, 36, pp. 156-165; MacMillan, H.L., Wathen, C.N., Barlow, J., Fergusson, D.M., Leventhal, J.M., Taussig, H.N., Interventions to prevent child maltreatment and associated impairment (2009) The Lancet, 373, pp. 250-266. , PMID: 19056113; Olds, D.L., Henderson, C.R., Chamberlin, R., Tatelbaum, R., Preventing child-abuse and neglect-A randomized trial of nurse home visitation (1986) Pediatrics, 78, pp. 65-78; Olds, D.L., Eckenrode, J., Henderson, C.R., Kitzman, H., Powers, J., Cole, R., Long-term effects of home visitation on maternal life course and child abuse and neglect (1997) Journal of the American Medical Association, 278, pp. 637-643. , PMID: 9272895; Olds, D.L., Robinson, J., O'Brien, R., Luckey, D.W., Pettitt, L.M., Henderson, C.R., Homevisiting by paraprofessionals and by nurses: A randomized, controlled trial (2002) Pediatrics, 110, pp. 486-496; Mejdoubi, J., Van Den Heijkant, S., Struijf, E., Van Leerdam, F., Hirasing, R., Crijnen, A., Addressing risk factors for child abuse among high risk pregnant women: Design of a Randomised Controlled Trial of the Nurse Family Partnership in Dutch preventive health care (2011) BMC Public Health, 11, p. 823. , PMID: 22017924; Mejdoubi, J., Van Den Heijkant, S., Struijf, E., Van Leerdam, F., Hirasing, R., Crijnen, A., Risicofactoren voor kindermishandeling bij jonge hoogrisicozwangeren: Design van het VoorZorgonderzoek (2013) JGZ Tijdschrift Voor Jeugdgezondheidszorg, 45 (2), pp. 26-31; Mejdoubi, J., Van Den Heijkant, S.C., Van Leerdam, F.J., Heymans, M.W., Hirasing, R.A., Crijnen, A.A., Effect of nurse home visits vs. Usual care on reducing intimate partner violence in young High-Risk pregnant women: A randomized controlled trial (2013) PLOS ONE, 8, p. e78185. , PMID: 24205150; Salazar, M., Valladares, E., Ohman, A., Hogberg, U., Ending intimate partner violence after pregnancy: Findings from a community-based longitudinal study in Nicaragua (2009) BMC Public Health, 9, p. 350. , PMID: 19765299; McFarlane, J.M., Groff, J.Y., O'Brien, J.A., Watson, K., Prevalence of partner violence against 7,443 African American, White, and Hispanic women receiving care at urban public primary care clinics (2005) Public Health Nurs, 22, pp. 98-107; Bruijn, D.R., Kooijman, K., Zoon, M., (2012) VoorZorg Babyhuisbezoeken., , Handleiding; Bruijn, D.R., Kooijman, K., Zoon, M., (2012) VoorZorg Peuterhuisbezoeken., , Handleiding; Kooijman, K., Blokland, G., Prinsen, B., Zoon, M., (2012) VoorZorg Zwangerschapshuisbezoeken., , Handleiding; Mejdoubi, J., Van Den Heijkant, S.C., Van Leerdam, F.J., Crone, M., Crijnen, A., Hirasing, R.A., (2013) Effects of Nurse Home Visitation on Cigarette Smoking, Pregnancy Outcomes and Breastfeeding: A Randomized Controlled Trial., , Midwifery; (2012) Ref Type: Report, , AMK Overzicht 2011.

Up to now, the majority of GWAS have focused on European populations. However, the inclusion of other ethnic groups as well as admixed populations in GWAS studies is rapidly rising following the pressing need to extrapolate findings to non-European populations and to increase statistical power. In this paper, we describe the methodological steps surrounding genetic data generation, quality control, study design and analytical procedures needed to run GWAS in the multiethnic and highly admixed Generation R Study, a large prospective birth cohort in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Furthermore, we highlight a number of practical considerations and alternatives pertinent to the quality control and analysis of admixed GWAS data. © 2015, The Author(s).","Admixed population; Genome-wide association studies; Genomic imputation; Multiethnic study; Quality control GWAS","Wellcome Trust Case Control, C., Genome-wide association study of 14,000 cases of seven common diseases and 3,000 shared controls (2007) Nature, 447 (7145), pp. 661-678; Hindorff, L.A., MacArthur, J., Morales, J., Junkins, H.A., (2013) Hall PN, , Klemm AK: Manolio TA.

It is suspected that polymorphisms in folate metabolism are associated with an increased risk of CHD, but the conclusion remains unclear. Studies have reported that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism was associated with the development of structural congenital heart malformations. The objective of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of available studies to identify common polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene in children with CHD and their mothers and to test for an association between genotype and disease. In all, 19 eligible studies comprising 4,219 cases and 20,123 controls were included in this meta-analysis. A significant association was found between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and CHD risk (OR: 1.26; 95 % CI = 1.06–1.51; p = 0.009) with no strong evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 39 %) in the fetal analysis. In the maternal analysis, the MTHFR C677T polymorphism was significantly associated with CHD risk (OR = 1.52; 95 % CI = 1.09–2.11; p = 0.01) with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 63 %). © 2014, Urban & Vogel.","Congenital heart disease; Folic acid; Genetic association; Meta-analysis; MTHFR polymorphisms","Maschhoff, (2004) Neo Rev, 5; Bernier, (2010) Semin Thorac Cardiovasc Surg Pediatr Card Sur Annu, 13, p. 26; Hall, (1998) Eur J Pediatr, 157, p. 445. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DyaK1cXktVKqtb8%3D, PID: 9667396; Shaw, (1995) Am J Med Genet, 59, p. 536. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK287mtFektw%3D%3D, PID: 8585581; Botto, (1996) Pediatrics, 98, p. 911. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK2s%2Fms1Sjtg%3D%3D, PID: 8909485; Ionescu-Ittu, R., Marelli, A.J., Mackie, A.S., Pilote, L., Prevalence of severe congenital heart disease after folic acid fortification of grain products: time trend analysis in Quebec, Canada (2009) BMJ, p. 338; Botto, (2000) Am J Epidemiol, 151, p. 862. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD3c3ltVWqug%3D%3D, PID: 10791559; Junker, (2001) Cardiovasc Res, 51, p. 251. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD3MXltlOis7c%3D, PID: 11470464; Tolarova, (1998) Am J Hum Genet, 63, p.

Existing theoretical work on carer investment rules has, however, largely focused on biparental care, and on modelling offspring provisioning in isolation from other stages of investment. Consequently, there has been little exploration of how maternal investment prior to birth might be expected to influence carer provisioning decisions after birth, and how these should be modified by the number of carers present. In particular, it is unclear whether mothers should increase or decrease their investment in each offspring under favourable rearing conditions, and whether this differs under alternative assumptions about the consequences of being 'high quality' at birth. We develop a game-theoretical model of cooperative care that incorporates female control of prebirth investment, and allow increased maternal investment to either substitute for later investment (giving offspring a 'head start') or raise the value of later investment (a 'silver spoon'). We show that mothers reduce prebirth investment under better rearing conditions (more helpers) when investment is substitutable, leading to concealed helper effects. In contrast, when maternal prebirth investment primes offspring to benefit more from postbirth care, mothers should take advantage of good care environments by investing more in offspring both before and after birth. These results provide novel mechanisms to explain contrasting patterns of maternal investment across cooperative breeders. © 2015.","Cooperative breeding; Game theory; Maternal effects; Parental care; Reproductive investment","Bolund, E., Schielzeth, H., Forstmeier, W., Compensatory investment in zebra finches: females lay larger eggs when paired to sexually unattractive males (2009) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 276, pp. 707-715; Brown, G.P., Shine, R., Beyond size-number trade-offs: clutch size as a maternal effect (2009) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 364, pp. 1097-1106; Burgess, S.C., Marshall, D.J., Adaptive parental effects: the importance of estimating environmental predictability and offspring fitness appropriately (2014) Oikos, 123, pp. 769-776; Burt, D.B., Peterson, A.T., Biology of cooperative-breeding scrub jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) of Oaxaca, Mexico (1993) The Auk, 110, pp. 207-214; Canestrari, D., Marcos, J.M., Baglione, V., Helpers at the nest compensate for reduced maternal investment in egg size in carrion crows (2011) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 24, pp. 1870-1878; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Reproductive effort and terminal investment in iteroparous animals (1984) American Naturalist, 123, pp. 212-229; Clutton-Brock, T.H., Albon, S., Guinness, F., Parental investment and sex differences in juvenile mortality in birds and mammals (1985) Nature, 313, pp. 131-133; Crick, H., Load-lightening in cooperatively breeding birds and the cost of reproduction (1992) Ibis, 134, pp. 56-61; Cunningham, E.J.A., Russell, A.F., Egg investment is influenced by male attractiveness in the mallard (2000) Nature, 404, pp. 74-77; Eising, C.M., Müller, W., Groothuis, T.G.G., Avian mothers create different phenotypes by hormone deposition in their eggs (2006) Biology Letters, 2, pp. 20-22; Fisher, M.O., Nager, R.G., Monaghan, P., Compensatory growth impairs adult cognitive performance (2006) PLoS Biology, 4, p. e251; Fox, C., Thakar, M., Mousseau, T., Egg size plasticity in a seed beetle: an adaptive maternal effect (1997) American Naturalist, 149, pp. 149-163; Grafen, A., On the uses of data on lifetime reproductive success (1988) Reproductive success, pp. 454-471. , University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL, T.H.

Their bone quality has been rarely studied either in noninflammatory ossicles or in those from ears with chronic inflammation. Our primary goal was to assess bone microarchitecture, morphology and variables reflecting bone quality from incuses, in comparison with those from human femoral cortical bone as controls. Secondly, the impact of chronic inflammation on quality of ossicles was documented. The study was performed on 15 noninflammatory incuses from 15 patients (35 ± 32. years, range: 2-91). Comparisons were performed with 13 inflammatory incuses from 13 patients (55 ± 20. years, range: 1-79) with chronic inflammation of the middle ear, essentially cholesteatoma. Microarchitecture and bone mineral density (BMD) were assessed by microcomputed tomography. Microhardness was measured by microindentation. Mineral and organic characteristics were investigated by Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy. Noninflammatory incuses were composed of a compact, well mineralized bone without bone marrow and with sparse vessels. Remodeling activity was rarely observed. Woven or lamellar textures and numerous osteocytes were observed. In inflammatory incuses, architecture was degraded, organic tissue was abundant and bone cavities contained fibrocellular tissue and adipocytes. BMD of noninflammatory incuses was significantly higher than BMD from both control bones (4 embedded cortical femoral bone samples; age: 72 ± 15. years, range: 50-85) and inflammatory incuses. Noninflammatory incuses were less hard than both control bone (8 cortical femoral bone samples; age: 49 ± 18. years, range: 24-74) and inflammatory incuses. All incuses were more mineralized and less mature than controls. In conclusion, bone quality of incuses (dense, well mineralized, hard) is well adapted to their function of sound transmission. In inflammatory condition, incuses were degraded, thus explaining the decline of hearing. Moreover, microhardness was found higher than in noninflammatory incuses. Compared to bone with remodeling, the mineralization index in incuses does not explain variation of microhardness. Interestingly, a linear multiple regression model indicated that a combination of two variables, i.e., crystallinity index (crystal size/perfection) and carbonation (incorporation of carbonate ions in apatite) explains 26% of the increase in microhardness variability. Because the low remodeling level of ossicles could not prevent the reversibility of their degradation which impacts audition quality, an early management of ear inflammation in chronic otitis is recommended. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Architecture; Hardness; Human ossicles; Incus bone quality; Mineralization","Yokoyama, T., Iino, Y., Kakizaki, K., Murakami, Y., Human temporal bone study on the postnatal ossification process of auditory ossicles (1999) Laryngoscope, 109, pp. 927-930; Graham, M.D., House, H.P., Human stapes crura.

Methods: Analyses was based on adolescents born between 1975 and 1991 to women from the 1979 National Longitudinal Study of Youth data set (N. =. 4762). Three types of family-level stressors were captured from birth to age 15: family disruption and conflict, financial strain, and maternal risky health behaviors, along with a total cumulative risk index. Body mass index was constructed on reference criteria for children outlined by the Centers for Disease Control. Multivariate logistic regressions were conducted for the three types of family stressors and for the total cumulative index. Results: The accumulation of family disruption and conflict and financial stress was positively related to female adolescents being overweight/obese. Childhood exposure to maternal risky health behaviors was positively associated with higher weight status for male adolescents. Total cumulative stress was related to overweight/obesity for females, but not males. Conclusion: Different family-level stress indices are associated with the weight status of female and male adolescents. Combining types of family-level stress into one cumulative index appears to mask these differences. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Adolescence; Cumulative stress; Gender; NLSY79; Obesity; Overweight","Bauman, L.J., Silver, E.J., Stein, R.E., Cumulative social disadvantage and child health (2006) Pediatrics, 117 (4), pp. 1321-1328; Biro, F.M., Wien, M., Childhood obesity and adult morbidities (2010) Am.

We hypothesized that an enriched environment restricted to pregnancy will succeed in accelerating the development of sensory and motor circuits in the offspring. Pregnant Wistar rats were maintained either under a standard condition - two animals per standard cage- or an enriched environment - eight subjects in larger cages with different physical configurations-. After birth, litters from both groups (. n=. 16 per group) were cross-fostered with mothers that were simultaneously maintained under standard environment during pregnancy. Sensory and motor development were studied in the pups of both groups with a battery of reflex and physical tests. Auditory and gait reflexes appeared two days earlier in the offspring of EE rats as compared to control subjects (. p<. 0.05). In addition, EE pups displayed a better performance in righting reflex, inclined board and geotaxis tests (. p<. 0.05). Differences were found even three weeks after birth. We conclude that EE limited to the phase of pregnancy stimulates the development of pups in utero so that they are born with a higher grade of development. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Embryonic development; Housing environment; Intrauterine growth; Pregnancy; Reflex tests","Altman, J., Sudarshan, K., Postnatal development of locomotor in the laboratory rat (1975) Anim.

Methods: Maternal abnormalities during pregnancy and delivery and infant congenital anomalies, physical development status, developmental quotient (DQ), HBV vertical transmission status, and HBV vaccination outcomes of 54 infants were evaluated (2010-2013). Results: No fetal abnormalities were observed during pregnancy or delivery. Postpartum, three infants (5.56%) had abnormalities: ankyloglossia, cutaneous hemangioma, and vaginal canal leak. Height and weight were within the normal range at birth and at 6 weeks, but were higher than the reference at 12 months ( p<. 0.05). Body mass index increased gradually with age ( p<. 0.05). DQ scores were normal (84.81%, 229/270) in 37 children (68.52%), abnormal or suspicious for a developmental delay (15.19%, 41/270) in 17 children (31.48%), and indicated a developmental delay (4.07%, 11/270) in seven children (12.96%). There were no significant differences in developmental delay between children prenatally exposed to telbivudine and controls ( p>. 0.05). HBV vertical transmission was successfully blocked in all infants. The effective HBV vaccination rate was 98.15% (53/54). Conclusions: The growth and development of children prenatally exposed to telbivudine was normal, indicating that telbivudine treatment during pregnancy is safe and effective. © 2015.","Children; Chronic hepatitis B;

The prevalence of gestational anxiety has grown in recent years, making the development of studies for its comprehension essential. Thus, the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of predictable and unpredictable chronic stressors on the anxiety profile of rats in three distinct stages of pregnancy (1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks). Wistar dams were divided into three groups: control, social separation and unpredictable chronic stress. Behavioral assessments were conducted in the Elevated Plus-Maze at the end of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks of gestation. The results showed that there was increased anxiety in the proximity of parturition in control dams. Chronic stressors differentially affected the behavior of pregnant rats according to the gestational period where they were applied: social separation decreased anxiety at the end of the 3rd week, while unpredictable chronic stress caused increased anxiety, especially at the end of the 2nd gestational week. These results show that there is a critical time during pregnancy for the onset of anxiety in control rats, depending on the gestational stage. The exposure to different types of chronic stressors may result in distinct behaviors related to this disorder. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Anxiety; Pregnancy; Social separation; Unpredictable chronic stress","(2001) The World Health Report 2001: Mental Health: New Understanding, New Hope, , World Health Organization, Geneva; Lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV/WHM-CIDI disorders by sex and cohort, , http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs/ftpdir/table_ncsr_LTprevgenderxage.pdf, [updated 2007 July 19; cited 2014 March 26].

Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that occupational exposure to dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) causes impairment in male fertility in a cohort of DDT exposed workers, in Sardinia, Italy. Methods: We accessed official records on date of marriage and date of birth of the first child to estimate time to pregnancy (TTP) in the spouses of 1223 workers employed in a 1946-1950 anti-malarial campaign. The TTP calculation was censored at the 13th month after date of marriage. We used a modified Cox's proportional hazard model to calculate the fecundability ratio (FR) by job, by cumulative exposure to DDT, and by time window in relation to the anti-malarial operations, adjusting by paternal age at marriage. Results: Among the spouses of DDT applicators, fecundability did not vary during DDT use (FR. =. 1.22, 95% CI 0.84-1.77) nor in the following decade (FR. =. 1.01, 95% CI 0.67-1.50) with reference to the prior years. A significant increase occurred among the unexposed and the less exposed sub-cohorts, which generated a non-significantly reduced FR among the DDT applicator sub-cohort with reference to the unexposed following exposure. Conclusion: We did not find evidence of an impairment in male fertility following heavy occupational exposure to DDT. However, although fecundability was highest among the spouses of the DDT applicators in the years prior to the anti-malarial campaign, we cannot exclude that DDT exposure prevented an increase parallel to that observed among the unexposed and the less exposed sub-cohorts. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","DDT; Male fertility; Occupational exposure; Time to pregnancy","Aneck-Hahn, N.H., Schulenburg, G.W., Bornman, M.S., Farias, P., de Jager, C., Impaired semen quality associated with environmental DDT exposure in young men living in a malaria area in the Limpopo Province, South Africa (2007) J.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the lncRNA profiles in low birth weight (LBW) rats with reduced nephron endowment induced by the restriction of maternal protein intake. LBW by reduced nephron endowment is a risk factor for hypertension and end-stage renal disease in adulthood. Methods: Kidneys were obtained from LBW rats fed a low-protein diet throughout gestation and lactation as well as from normal control rats born from dams fed normal protein diets at postnatal day 1 (p1) and 10 (p10). The total number of glomeruli in the kidneys was counted at p10. LncRNA expression profiles were analyzed by sequencing and screening using the Agilent Rat lncRNA Array. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of these lncRNAs confirmed the identity of some genes. Results: The total number of glomeruli per kidney at p10 was significantly lower in LBW rats than in controls. A total of 42 lncRNAs were identified to be significantly differentially expressed, with fold-changes ≥ 2.0, between the two groups. According to correlation analysis between the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs involved in kidney development, we randomly selected a number of lncRNAs for comparison analysis between LBW and control kidneys at the two time-points, p1 and p10, using qRT-PCR. Three lncRNAs (TCONS-00014139, TCONS-00014138, and TCONS-00017119), which were significantly correlated with the mRNA expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase 4, were aberrantly expressed in LBW rats, compared with controls, at both p1 and p10. Conclusions: LncRNAs are aberrantly expressed in the kidneys of LBW rats, compared with controls, during nephron development, which indicates that lncRNAs might be involved in impaired nephron endowment. © 2015 Li et al.",,"Luyckx, V.A., Bertram, J.F., Brenner, B.M., Fall, C., Hoy, W.E., Ozanne, S.E., Effect of fetal and child health on kidney development and long-term risk of hypertension and kidney disease (2013) Lancet, 382, pp. 273-283. , PMID: 23727166; Zandi-Nejad, K., Luyckx, V.A., Brenner, B.M., Adult hypertension and kidney disease: The role of fetal programming (2006) Hypertension, 47, pp. 502-508. , PMID: 16415374; Amann, K., Plank, C., Dotsch, J., Low nephron number - A new cardiovascular risk factor in children?

Though, recent studies show a reversal of inequalities in Italy and Spain, for example. We investigated whether this evolution also applied to Portugal by describing the evolution of socioeconomic inequalities in smoking between 1987 and 2006. Methods: We used data from the four Portuguese national health interview surveys (N∈=∈120,140) carried out so far. Socioeconomic status was measured by the educational and income levels of respondents. Socioeconomic inequalities were measured through Odds Ratios (OR), Relative Inequality Indexes (RII), and Concentration Indexes (CI) on being current, ever, and former smoker, adjusting for sex and age. Analyses were performed separately for men and women, and for different birth cohorts. Results: Among men, smoking was initially more concentrated in high-socioeconomic status individuals (RII∈=∈0.84, 95% Confidence Intervals [95% CI] 0.76-0.93, 1987) but this pattern reversed in the last survey (RII∈=∈1.49, 95% CI 1.34-1.65, 2005/6). Indeed, higher cessation rates were observed among high-socioeconomic groups among all respondents (RII∈=∈0.89, 95% CI 0.84-0.95), coupled with higher initiation rates among the worse-off in younger cohorts (RII∈=∈1.18, 95% CI 1.05-1.31, for youngest generation, 2005/6). Among women, the richer and more educated smoked more in all surveys (RII∈=∈0.21, 95% CI 0.16-0.27, 2005/6), despite being also more likely to quit (RII∈=∈0.41, 95% CI 0.30-0.55). The pattern among women evolved towards a reduction of inequality, which however remained favourable to the worse-off. Conclusions: Inequalities have been increasingly unfavourable to the worse-off in Portugal, although better-off women are still more likely to smoke. Worrisome inequality trends have been observed among the youngest generations, which call for the rapid implementation of equity-oriented tobacco control policies. © 2015 Alves et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Inequalities; Portugal; Smoking; Socioeconomic status","Mackenbach, J.P., Kunst, A.E., Cavelaars, A.E., Groenhof, F., Geurts, J.J., Socioeconomic inequalities in morbidity and mortality in western Europe (1997) Lancet, 349, pp. 1655-1659. , 1:STN:280:DyaK2szivF2htg%3D%3D 9186383; Hernández-Quevedo, C., Jones, A.M., Rice, N., Persistence in health limitations: A European comparative analysis (2008) J Heal Ec, 27, pp. 1472-1488; Mackenbach, J.P., Stirbu, I., Roskam, A.-J., Schaap, M.M., Menvielle, G., Leinsalu, M., Kunst, A.E., Socioeconomic inequalities in health in 22 European countries (2008) N Engl J Med, 358, pp. 2468-2481. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXmvFKlt7o%3D 18525043; Huisman, M., Kunst, A.E., Mackenbach, J.P., Inequalities in the prevalence of smoking in the European Union: Comparing education and income (2005) Prev Med, 40, pp. 756-764. , 1:STN:280:DC%2BD2M3hslCrsA%3D%3D 15850876; Lopez, A., Collishaw, N., Piha, T., A descriptive model of the cigarette epidemic in developed countries (1994) Tob Control, 3, p. 242. , 1759359; Nagelhout, G.E., De Korte-De, B.D., Kunst, A.E., Van Der Meer, R.M., De Vries, H., Van Gelder, B.M., Willemsen, M.C., Trends in socioeconomic inequalities in smoking prevalence, consumption, initiation, and cessation between 2001 and 2008 in the Netherlands.

Objectives: (1) To characterize the transcriptomic profiles of chorioamniotic membranes in preterm neonates with and without neurocognitive impairment via microarrays and (2) to determine if neonates with neurocognitive impairment can be identified at birth. Materials/Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted to examine the chorioamniotic transcriptome of gestational-age matched very preterm neonates with and without neurocognitive impairment at 18-24 months' corrected-age defined by a Bayley-III Cognitive Composite Score <80 (n = 14 each). Pathway analysis with down-weighting of overlapping genes (PADOG ) was performed to identify KEGG pathways relevant to the phenotype. Select differentially expressed genes were profiled using qRT-PCR and a multi-gene disease prediction model was developed using linear discriminant analysis. The model's predictive performance was tested on a new set of cases and controls (n = 19 each). Results: 1) 117 genes were differentially expressed among neonates with and without subsequent neurocognitive impairment (p<0.05 and fold change >1.5); 2) Gene ontology analysis indicated enrichment of 19 biological processes and 3 molecular functions; 3)PADOG identified 4 significantly perturbed KEGG pathways: oxidative phosphorylation, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease (q-value <0.1); 4) 48 of 90 selected differentially expressed genes were confirmed by qRT-PCR, including genes implicated in energy metabolism, neuronal signaling, vascular permeability and response to injury (e.g., up-regulation of SEPP1, APOE, DAB2, CD163 , CXCL12, VWF; down-regulation of HAND1, OSR1) (p<0.05); and 5) a multi-gene model predicted 18-24 month neurocognitive impairment (using the ratios of OSR1/VWF and HAND1/VWF at birth) in a larger, independent set (sensitivity = 74%, at specificity = 83%). Conclusions: Gene expression patterns in the chorioamniotic membranes link neurocognitive impairment in preterm infants to neurodegenerative disease pathways and might be used to predict neurocognitive impairment.

Women who contract rubella virus during pregnancy may experience complications such as foetal death or give birth to babies born with congenital rubella syndrome. Vaccination against rubella is the most effective and economical approach to control the disease, and to avoid the long term effects and high costs of care for children with congenital rubella syndrome as well as to prevent death from complications. Zimbabwe commenced rubella surveillance in 1999, despite lacking a rubella vaccine in the national Expanded Programme on Immunization, as per the World Health Organization recommendation to establish a surveillance system to estimate the disease burden before introduction of a rubella vaccine. The purpose of this analysis is to describe the disease trends and population demographics of rubella cases that were identified through the Zimbabwe national measles and rubella case-based surveillance system during a 5-year period between 2007 and 2011. Methods: Data from the Zimbabwe National Measles Laboratory for the 5-year study period were analysed for age, sex, district of origin, seasonality, and rubella IgM serostatus. Results: A total of 3428 serum samples from cases of suspected measles in all administrative districts of the country were received by the laboratory during this period. Cases included 51% males and 49% females. Of these, 2999 were tested for measles IgM of which 697 (23.2%) were positive. Of the 2302 measles IgM-negative samples, 865 (37.6%) were rubella IgM-positive. Ninety-eight percent of confirmed rubella cases were children younger than 15 years of age. Most infections occurred during the dry season. Conclusions: The national case-based surveillance revealed the disease burden and trends of rubella in Zimbabwe. These data add to the evidence for introducing rubella-containing vaccine into the national immunization programme. © 2015 Chimhuya et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Incidence; Rubella; Seroprevalence; Surveillance; Trends; Zimbabwe","Cooper, L.Z., Alford, C.A., Rubella (2006) Infectious Diseases of the Fetus and the Newborn Infant, pp. 894-926. , J.S.

For many Indonesian patients born with ambiguous genitalia, limited medical treatment is available. Consequently, affected individuals are raised with ambiguous genitalia and atypical secondary sex characteristics. We investigated gender identity and gender role behavior in 118 Indonesian subjects (77 males, 41 females) with different types of DSD in comparison with 118 healthy controls matched for gender, age, and residential setting (rural, suburban, or urban). In Study 1, we report on methodological aspects of the investigation, including scale adaptation, pilot testing, and determining reliability and validity of measures. In Study 2, we report on gender development in 60 children (42 boys, 18 girls), 24 adolescents (15 boys, 9 girls), and 34 adults (19 men, 15 women) with DSD. The majority of participants with DSD never received any medical or surgical treatment prior to this study. We observed a gender change in all age groups, with the greatest incidence in adults. Among patients who changed, most changed from female to male, possessed a 46,XY karyotype, and had experienced significant masculinization during life. Gender identity confusion and cross-gender behavior was more frequently observed in children with DSD raised as girls compared to boys. Puberty and associated masculinization were related to gender problems in individuals with 46,XY DSD raised female. An integrated clinical and psychological follow-up on gender outcome is necessary prior to puberty and adulthood. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Disorders of sex development; Gender identity; Gender role behavior; Indonesia; Intersexuality",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925637649

The aim of this study was to investigate a possible relationship between PD risk and sun exposure looking at seasonal birth variation of PD subjects in the homogenous geographic area of Naples, Italy. We selected 898 PD subjects and matched with 1796 controls. McNemar’s test with Bonferroni correction and autocorrelation were used to test seasonality in birth trends. No difference was found for the month and season of birth between PD subjects and controls. We found a 3.3 % increase of PD female subjects born in September (3.3 %) and 4.1 % increase of PD male subjects born in spring comparing to controls but were not significant after Bonferroni correction.

Methods: Monthly summary HIS data concordance between a gold standard data quality audit and routine HIS data was assessed in 26 health facilities in Sofala Province, Mozambique across four indicators (outpatient consults, institutional births, first antenatal care visits, and third dose of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus vaccination) and five levels of health system data aggregation (daily facility paper registers, monthly paper facility reports, monthly paper district reports, monthly electronic district reports, and monthly electronic provincial reports) through retrospective yearly audits conducted July-August 2010-2013. We used mixed-effects linear models to quantify changes in data quality over time and associated health system determinants. Results: Median concordance increased from 56.3% during the baseline period (2009-2010) to 87.5% during 2012-2013. Concordance improved by 1.0% (confidence interval [CI]: 0.60, 1.5) per month during the intervention period of 2010-2011 and 1.6% (CI: 0.89, 2.2) per month from 2011-2012. No significant improvements were observed from 2009-2010 (during baseline period) or 2012-2013. Facilities with more technical staff (aβ: 0.71; CI: 0.14, 1.3), more first antenatal care visits (aβ: 3.3; CI: 0.43, 6.2), and fewer clinic beds (aβ: -0.94; CI: -1.7, -0.20) showed more improvements. Compared to facilities with no stock-outs, facilities with five essential drugs stocked out had 51.7% (CI: -64.8 -38.6) lower data concordance. Conclusions: A data quality intervention was associated with significant improvements in health information system data concordance across public-sector health facilities in rural and urban Mozambique. Concordance was higher at those facilities with more human resources for health and was associated with fewer clinic-level stock-outs of essential medicines. Increased investments should be made in data audit and feedback activities alongside targeted efforts to improve HIS data in low- and middle-income countries. © 2015 Wagenaar et al.",,"AbouZahr, C., Boerma, T., Health information systems: the foundations of public health (2005) Bull World Health Organ, 83, pp. 578-583; Bosch-Capblanch, X., Ronveau, O., Doyle, V., Remedios, V., Bchir, A., Accuracy and quality of immunization information systems in fourty-one low income countries (2009) Trop Med Int Health, 14 (1), pp. 2-10; Chilundo, B., Sundby, J., Aanestad, M., Analysing the quality of routine malaria data in Mozambique (2004) Malar J, 3 (3), p. 3; Lim, S.S., David, S.B., Charrow, A., Murray, C.J.L., Tracking progress towards universal childhood immunisation and the impact of global initiatives: a systematic analyses of three-dose diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis immunisation coverage (2008) Lancet, 372, pp. 2031-2046; Murray, C.J.L., Shengelia, B., Gupta, N., Moussavi, S., Tandon, A., Thieren, M., Validity of reported vaccination coverage in 45 countries (2003) Lancet, 362, pp. 1022-1027; Gething, P., Noor, A., Gikandi, P., Ogara, E.A., Hay, S.I., Nixon, M.S., Improving imperfect data from health management information systems in Africa using space-time geostatistics (2006) PLoS Med, 3, p. e271; Rowe, A.K., Kachur, P.S., Yoon, S.S., Lynch, M., Slutsker, L., Steketee, R., Caution is required when using health facility-based data to evaluate the health impact of malaria control efforts in Africa (2009) Malar J., 8 (209); Mate, K.S., Bennett, B., Mphatswe, W., Barker, P., Rollins, N., Challenges for routine health system data management in a large public programme to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission in South Africa (2009) PLoS One, 4 (5), p. e5483; Amouzou, A., Kachaka, W., Banda, B., Chimzimu, M., Hill, K., Bryce, J., Monitoring child survival in 'real time' using routine health facility records: results from Malawi (2013) Trop Med Int Health.; Rowe, A.K., Potential of integrated continuous surveys and quality management to support monitoring, evaluation, and the scale-up of health interventions in developing countries (2009) Am J Trop Med Hyg, 80 (6), pp. 971-979; Admon, A.J., Bazile, J., Makungwa, H., Chingoli, M.A., Hirschhorn, L.R., Peckarsky, M., Assessing and improving data quality from community health workers: a successful intervention in Neno, Malawi (2013) Public Health Action, 3 (1), pp. 56-59; Mphatswe, W., Mate, K.S., Bennett, B., Ngidi, H., Reddy, J., Barker, P.M., Improving public health information: a data quality intervention in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (2012) Bull World Health Organ, 90, pp. 176-182; Braa, J., Heywood, A., Sahay, S., Improving quality and use of data through data-use workshops: Zanzibar, United Republic of Tanzania (2012) Bull World Health Organ, 90, pp. 379-384; Cibulskis, R.E., Hiawalyer, G., Information systems for health sector monitoring in Papua New Guinea (2002) Bull World Health Organ, 80, pp. 752-758; Sherr, K., Cuembelo, F., Michel, C., Gimbel, S., Micek, M., Kariaganis, M., Strengthening integrated primary health care in Sofala, Mozambique (2013) BMC Health Serv Res., 13, p.

This study tested the hypothesis that expression of genes unique to Mφs characterizes the prepartum from unremodeled nonpregnant cervix. Perfused cervix from prepartum day 21 postbreeding (D21) or nonpregnant (NP) rats, with or without Mφs, had RNA extracted and whole genome microarray analysis performed. By subtractive analyses, expression of 194 and 120 genes related to Mφs in the cervix from D21 rats were increased and decreased, respectively. In both D21 and NP groups, 158 and 57 Mφ genes were also more or less up- or down-regulated, respectively. Mφ gene expression patterns were most strongly correlated within groups and in 5 major clustering patterns. In the cervix from D21 rats, functional categories and canonical pathways of increased expression by Mφ gene related to extracellular matrix, cell proliferation, differentiation, as well as cell signaling. Pathways were characteristic of inflammation and wound healing, e.g., CD163, CD206, and CCR2. Signatures of only inflammation pathways, e.g., CSF1R, EMR1, and MMP12 were common to both D21 and NP groups. Thus, a novel and complex balance of Mφ genes and clusters differentiated the degraded extracellular matrix and cellular genomic activities in the cervix before birth from the unremodeled state. Predicted Mφ activities, pathways, and networks raise the possibility that expression patterns of specific genes characterize and promote prepartum remodeling of the cervix for parturition at term and with preterm labor. © 2015 Dobyns et al.",,"Shynlova, O., Tsui, P., Jaffer, S., Lye, S.J., Integration of endocrine and mechanical signals in the regulation of myometrial functions during pregnancy and labour1 (2009) Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol, 144, pp. S2-S10. , PMID: 19299064; Osman, I., Young, A., Ledingham, M.A., Thomson, A.J., Jordan, F., Greer, I.A., Leukocyte density and proinflammatory cytokine expression in human fetal membranes, decidua, cervix and myometrium before and during labour at term (2003) Mol Hum Reprod, 9 (1), pp. 41-45. , PMID: 12529419; Sahlin, L., Stjernholm-Vladic, Y., Roos, N., Masironi, B., Ekman-Ordeberg, G., Impaired leukocyte influx in cervix of postterm women not responding to prostaglandin priming (2008) Reprod Biol Endocrinol, 6, pp. 36-50. , PMID: 18764934; Dubicke, A., Fransson, E., Centini, G., Andersson, E., Bystrom, B., Malmstrom, A., Pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in human preterm and term cervical ripening1 (2010) J Reprod Immunol, 84 (2), pp. 176-185. , PMID: 20096464; Yellon, S.M., Dobyns, A.E., Beck, H.L., Kurtzman, J.T., Garfield, R.E., Kirby, M.A., Loss of progesterone receptor-mediated actions induce preterm cellular and structural remodeling of the cervix and premature birth (2013) PLoS One, 8 (12), p. e81340. , PMID: 24339918; Mahendroo, M., Cervical remodeling in term and preterm birth: Insights from an animal model (2012) Reproduction, 143 (4), pp. 429-438. , PMID: 22344465; Mitchell, B.F., Taggart, M.J., Are animal models relevant to key aspects of human parturition?

The aim of this study was to evaluate and describe the results of surveillance of HAIs in a III level NICU in Naples, Italy during 20062010. Methods: The surveillance covered 1,699 neonates of all birth weight (BW) classes with>2days NICU stay. Infections were defined using standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions adapted to neonatal pathology and were considered to be healthcareassociated if they developed>2days after NICU admission. Results: One hundredfiftythree HAIs were diagnosed with a frequency of 9% and an incidence density of 3.5 per 1000days of hospital stay. HAIs developed in all BW classes, but patients weighing≤1000g at birth were more affected with a decreasing trend from the lowest to the highest BW classes. Sepsis proved to be the most frequent infection (44.4%), followed by urinary tract infection (UTI) (28.8%), pneumonia (25.5%) and meningitis (1.3%). Device associated infections (i.e. central lineassociated bloodstream infections (BSIs), umbilical catheterassociated BSI and ventilator associated pneumonias (VAPs) represented 64.1% of all HAIs. Most frequent pathogens responsible for all types of infections were: P. aeruginosa (17%), C. parapsilosis (16.3%), E. coli (13.1%), C. albicans (10.5%), non extended spectrum betalactamase (ESBL) K. pneumoniae (7.8%), and coagulasenegative Staphylococci (5.2%). No microbiological diagnosis was achieved for 6.5% of infections. Conclusions: HAIs developed in all BW classes but low BW neonates were at major risk to acquire HAIs in our NICU. Use of central line, umbilicalcatheter and mechanical ventilation was associated with higher risk of infection.

Methods: Periodontitis was induced in pregnant mice using an inoculum of Fn and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In parallel, four sub-species of Fn were individually injected into the circulatory system. At day 18 of gestation, the placenta, liver, spleen and blood were harvested and litter size, number of viable fetuses and resorptions, maternal, fetal and placenta weights were recorded. For the direct inoculation group, some mice were allowed to deliver for assessment of length of gestation, litter size, maternal, placental and pup weight. The presence of Fn was assessed by PCR and inflammatory mediators were measured by ELISA or multiplex analysis. Results: Mice with alveolar bone loss, a marker of periodontitis, demonstrated significantly higher fetal weights (p = 0.015) and fetal/placental weight ratios (p = 0.030). PCR analysis of maternal organs did not identify Fn in any extracted tissues. In mice that received direct injection of Fn subspecies, varying degrees of APO were observed including preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, and fetal loss. Haematogenous spread of only Fn subsp. nucleatum to the placenta was confirmed. Litter size was significantly smaller (p = 0.023) and the number of resorptions was higher in inoculated versus control groups. Mice injected with subsp. nucleatum had significantly increased circulating CRP levels (p = 0.020) compared to controls while the mice with induced periodontitis had increased levels of IL-6 (p = 0.047) and IL-8 (p = 0.105). Conclusions: Periodontitis in mice elevated fetal weight and the fetal weight/placental weight ratio. This study found that subsp. nucleatum migrated haematogenously to the placenta, leading to APO in mice. The study supports the potential role of Fn in the association between periodontitis and APO. © 2015 Stockham et al.",,"Amano, A., Host-parasite interactions in periodontitis: Subgingival infection and host sensing (2010) Periodontol, 52, pp. 7-11. , 2000 PMID: 20017792; Han, Y.W., Wang, X., Mobile microbiome: Oral bacteria in extra-oral infections and inflammation (2013) J Dent Res, 92, pp. 485-491. , PMID: 23625375; Offenbacher, S., Katz, V., Fertik, G., Collins, J., Boyd, D., Maynor, G., Periodontal infection as a possible risk factor for preterm low birth weight (1996) J Periodontol, 67, pp. 1103-1113. , PMID: 8910829; Madianos, P.N., Bobetsis, Y.A., Offenbacher, S., Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) and periodontal disease: Pathogenic mechanisms (2013) J Clin Periodontol, 40, pp. S170-S180. , PMID: 23627327; Jeffcoat, M., Parry, S., Sammel, M., Clothier, B., Catlin, A., Macones, G., Periodontal infection and preterm birth: Successful periodontal therapy reduces the risk of preterm birth (2010) BJOG, 118, pp. 250-256. , PMID: 20840689; Jeffcoat, M.K., Geurs, N.C., Reddy, M.S., Cliver, S.P., Goldenberg, R.L., Hauth, J.C., Periodontal infection and preterm birth: Results of a prospective study (2001) J Am Dent Assoc, 132, pp. 875-880. , PMID: 11480640; Lopez, N.J., Smith, P.C., Gutierrez, J., Periodontal therapy may reduce the risk of preterm low birth weight in women with periodontal disease: A randomized controlled trial (2002) J Periodontol, 73, pp. 911-924. , PMID: 12211502; Lopez, N.J., Smith, P.C., Gutierrez, J., Higher risk of preterm birth and low birth weight in women with periodontal disease (2002) J Dent Res, 81, pp. 58-63. , PMID: 11820369; Macones, G.A., Parry, S., Nelson, D.B., Strauss, J.F., Ludmir, J., Cohen, A.W., Treatment of localized periodontal disease in pregnancy does not reduce the occurrence of preterm birth: Results from the Periodontal Infections and Prematurity Study (PIPS) (2010) Am J Obstet Gynecol, 202, pp. 147+e141-e148. , PMID: 20113691; Michalowicz, B.S., Hodges, J.S., DiAngelis, A.J., Lupo, V.R., Novak, M.J., Ferguson, J.E., Treatment of periodontal disease and the risk of preterm birth (2006) N Engl J Med, 355, pp. 1885-1894. , PMID: 17079762; Newnham, J.P., Newnham, I.A., Ball, C.M., Wright, M., Pennell, C.E., Swain, J., Treatment of periodontal disease during pregnancy: A randomized controlled trial (2009) Obstet Gynecol, 114, pp. 1239-1248. , PMID: 19935025; Offenbacher, S., Lin, D., Strauss, R., McKaig, R., Irving, J., Barros, S.P., Effects of periodontal therapy during pregnancy on periodontal status, biologic parameters, and pregnancy outcomes: A pilot study (2006) J Periodontol, 77, pp. 2011-2024. , PMID: 17209786; Oliveira, A.M., De Oliveira, P.A., Cota, L.O., Magalhaes, C.S., Moreira, A.N., Costa, F.O., Periodontal therapy and risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes (2011) Clin Oral Investig, 15, pp. 609-615. , PMID: 20495936; Tarannum, F., Faizuddin, M., Effect of periodontal therapy on pregnancy outcome in women affected by periodontitis (2007) J Periodontol, 78, pp. 2095-2103. , PMID: 17970675; Periodontal diseases in the Australian adult population (2009) Aust Dent J, 54, pp. 390-393. , PMID: 20415940; Eke, P.I., Dye, B.A., Wei, L., Thornton-Evans, G.O., Genco, R.J., Beck, J., Prevalence of periodontitis in adults in the United States: 2009 and 2010 (2012) J Dent Res, 91, pp. 914-920. , PMID: 22935673; Beck, S., Wojdyla, D., Say, L., Betran, A.P., Merialdi, M., Requejo, J.H., The worldwide incidence of preterm birth: A systematic review of maternal mortality and morbidity (2010) Bull World Health Organ, 88, pp. 31-38. , PMID: 20428351; Behrman, R., Butler, A., (2007) Preterm Birth: Causes, Consequences, and Prevention, , Washington, D.C: The National Academies Press; Fardini, Y., Chung, P., Dumm, R., Joshi, N., Han, Y.W., Transmission of diverse oral bacteria to murine placenta: Evidence for the oral microbiome as a potential source of intrauterine infection (2010) Infect Immun, 78, pp. 1789-1796. , PMID: 20123706; Prince, A.L., Antony, K.M., Ma, J., Aagaard, K.M., The microbiome and development: A mother's perspective (2014) Semin Reprod Med, 32, pp. 14-22. , PMID: 24390916; Bobetsis, Y.A., Barros, S.P., Offenbacher, S., Exploring the relationship between periodontal disease and pregnancy complications (2006) J Am Dent Assoc, 137, pp. 7S-13S. , PMID: 17012730; Africa, C.W., Oral colonization of Gram-negative anaerobes as a risk factor for preterm delivery (2011) Virulence, 2, pp. 498-508. , PMID: 21971188; Han, Y.W., Oral health and adverse pregnancy outcomes - What's next?

The diaphragm is derived from multiple embryonic sources, but how these give rise to the diaphragm is unknown, and, despite the identification of many CDH-associated genes, the etiology of CDH is incompletely understood. Using mouse genetics, we show that the pleuroperitoneal folds (PPFs), which are transient embryonic structures, are the source of the diaphragm's muscle connective tissue and regulate muscle development, and we show that the striking migration of PPF cells controls diaphragm morphogenesis. Furthermore, Gata4 mosaic mutations in PPF-derived muscle connective tissue fibroblasts result in the development of localized amuscular regions that are biomechanically weaker and more compliant, leading to CDH. Thus, the PPFs and muscle connective tissue are critical for diaphragm development, and mutations in PPF-derived fibroblasts are a source of CDH. © 2015 Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

These findings markedly modified the current field of research on the etiology of ALL. In this new context, the present exploratory study investigated the possible interactions between these at-risk alleles and the non-genetic suspected ALL risk factors that were of sufficient prevalence in the French ESCALE study: maternal use of home insecticides during pregnancy, preconception paternal smoking, and some proxies for early immune modulation, i.e. breastfeeding, history of common infections before age one year, and birth order. The analyses were based on 434 ALL cases and 442 controls of European origin, drawn from the nationwide population-based case-control study ESCALE. Information on non-genetic factors was obtained by standardized telephone interview. Interactions between rs10740055 in ARID5B or rs4132601 in IKZF1 and each of the suspected non-genetic factors were tested, with the SNPs coded as counts of minor alleles (trend variable). Statistical interactions were observed between rs4132601 and maternal insecticide use (p = 0.012), breastfeeding p = 0.017) and repeated early common infections (p = 0.0070), with allelic odds ratios (OR) which were only increased among the children not exposed to insecticides (OR = 1.8, 95%CI: 1.3, 2.4), those who had been breastfed (OR = 1.8, 95%CI: 1.3, 2.5) and those who had had repeated early common infections (OR = 2.4, 95%CI: 1.5, 3.8). The allelic ORs were close to one among children exposed to insecticides, who had not been breastfed and who had had no or few common infections. Repeated early common infections interacted with rs10740055 (p = 0.018) in the case-only design. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether these observations of a modification of the effect of the at-risk alleles by non-genetic factors are chance findings or reflect true underlying mechanisms. © 2015 Rudant et al.",,"Lacour, B., Guyot-Goubin, A., Guissou, S., Bellec, S., Desandes, E., Clavel, J., Incidence of childhood cancer in France: National Children Cancer Registries, 2000-2004 (2010) Eur J Cancer Prev., 19, pp. 173-181. , PMID: 20361423;

The aim of this study was to evaluate and describe the results of surveillance of HAIs in a III level NICU in Naples, Italy during 2006-2010. Methods: The surveillance covered 1,699 neonates of all birth weight (BW) classes with > 2 days NICU stay. Infections were defined using standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions adapted to neonatal pathology and were considered to be healthcare-associated if they developed > 2 days after NICU admission. Results: One hundred-fifty-three HAIs were diagnosed with a frequency of 9% and an incidence density of 3.5 per 1000 days of hospital stay. HAIs developed in all BW classes, but patients weighing ≤ 1000 g at birth were more affected with a decreasing trend from the lowest to the highest BW classes. Sepsis proved to be the most frequent infection (44.4%), followed by urinary tract infection (UTI) (28.8%), pneumonia (25.5%) and meningitis (1.3%). Device associated infections (i.e. central line-associated bloodstream infections (BSIs), umbilical catheter-associated BSI and ventilator associated pneumonias (VAPs) represented 64.1% of all HAIs. Most frequent pathogens responsible for all types of infections were: P. aeruginosa (17%), C. parapsilosis (16.3%), E. coli (13.1%), C. albicans (10.5%), non- extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) K. pneumoniae (7.8%), and coagulase-negative Staphylococci (5.2%). No microbiological diagnosis was achieved for 6.5% of infections. Conclusions: HAIs developed in all BW classes but low BW neonates were at major risk to acquire HAIs in our NICU. Use of central line-, umbilical-catheter and mechanical ventilation was associated with higher risk of infection. Our findings highlight the importance of an extensive surveillance approach in the NICU setting, which includes all BW classes of neonates and monitors infections associated with the use of medical devices. © 2015 Crivaro et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Active surveillance; Healthcare-associated infections; Neonatal intensive care units",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928186436

To determine whether the following three affect it; (1) infant gender and mother’s parity, (2) growth restriction, and (3) preeclampsia. Methods: We employed fetal/placental weight ratio (F/P). Subjects consisted of 53,650 infants and their placentas from women who vaginally delivered singleton live term infants. First, we examined whether F/P differs among the infant’s gender or mother’s parity. We classified the population into 4 categories according to gender and parity: male, nulliparous (n=7,431), male, multiparous (n=7,859), female, nulliparous (n=7,559), female, multiparous (n=7,800), and, compared F/P among the four groups. Next, we determined whether F/P differs in “small” or “large” for gestational age (SGA or LGA) infants, compared with appropriate for gestational age infants. Last, we determined whether preeclampsia (representative disorder of SGA) affects F/P. Results: (1) F/P significantly differed according to infant gender and parity: female and nulliparity had significantly smaller F/P. F/P was significantly smaller in (2) SGA infants, and (3) infants from preeclamptic mothers. Conclusion: We for the first time showed that in Japanese term vaginally-delivered singleton population, the following three had significantly smaller F/P than controls thus had “inappropriately heavy placenta”: (1) female gender and nulliparity, (2) SGA infants, and (3) infants from preeclamptic mothers. We recommend that these factors should be taken into account in evaluating placental weight. These data may also be useful for further clarifying the fetal-placental pathophysiology in these conditions. © 2015 Ivyspring International Publisher.","Fetal/placental weight (F/P) ratio; Placental weight; Preeclampsia; Small for gestational age","Salafia, C.M., Zhang, J., Charles, A.K., Placental characteristics and birth weight (2008) Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol, 22, pp. 229-239; Molteni, R.A., Placental growth and fetal/placental weight (F/P) ratios throughout gestation-their relationship to patterns of fetal growth (1984) Semin Perinatol, 8, pp. 94-100; Wallace, J.M., Bhattacharya, S., Horgan, G.W., Gestational age, gender and parity specific centile charts for placental weight for singleton deliveries in Aberdeen, UK (2013) Placenta, 30, pp. 269-274; Naeye, R.L., Do placental weights have clinical significance?

One of the most economical and effective methods of tsetse control is the use of insecticide-treated screens, called targets, that simulate hosts. Targets have been ~1m2, but recently it was shown that those tsetse that occupy riverine situations, and which are the main vectors of sleeping sickness, respond well to targets only ~0.06m2. The cheapness of these tiny targets suggests the need to reconsider what intensity and duration of target deployments comprise the most cost-effective strategy in various riverine habitats. A deterministic model, written in Excel spreadsheets and managed by Visual Basic for Applications, simulated the births, deaths and movement of tsetse confined to a strip of riverine vegetation composed of segments of habitat in which the tsetse population was either self-sustaining, or not sustainable unless supplemented by immigrants. Results suggested that in many situations the use of tiny targets at high density for just a few months per year would be the most cost-effective strategy for rapidly reducing tsetse densities by the ~90% expected to have a great impact on the incidence of sleeping sickness. Local elimination of tsetse becomes feasible when targets are deployed in isolated situations, or where the only invasion occurs from populations that are not self-sustaining. Seasonal use of tiny targets deserves field trials. The ability to recognise habitat that contains tsetse populations which are not self-sustaining could improve the planning of all methods of tsetse control, against any species, in riverine, savannah or forest situations. Criteria to assist such recognition are suggested. © 2015 Vale et al.",,"Simarro, P.P., Cecchi, G., Paone, M., Franco, J.R., Diarra, A., The atlas of human African trypanosomiasis: a contribution to global mapping of neglected tropical diseases (2010) Int J Health Geogr, 9, p. 57; Maudlin, I., Holmes, P.H., Miles, M.A., (2004) The trypanosomiases; Shaw, A.P.M., Torr, S.J., Waiswa, C., Cecchi, G., Wint, W., Mattioli, R.C., Robinson, T.P., Estimating the costs of tsetse control options: an example for Uganda (2013) Prev Vet Med, 110, pp. 290-303; Vale, G.A., Torr, S.J., Maudlin, I., Holmes, P.H., Miles, M.A., (2004) The Trypanosomiases, pp. 113-117; Lindh, J.M., Torr, S.J., Vale, G.A., Lehane, M.J., Improving the cost-effectiveness of artificial visual baits for controlling the tsetse fly Glossina fuscipes fuscipes (2009) PLoS Negl Trop Dis, 3 (7), p. e474; Vale, G.A., Hargrove, J.W., Solano, P., Courtin, F., Rayaisse J-, B., Explaining the host-finding behaviour of blood-sucking insects: computerized simulation of the effects of habitat geometry on tsetse fly movement (2014) PLoS Negl Trop Dis, 8 (6), p. e2901; Solano, P., Torr, S.J., Lehane, M.J., Is vector control needed to eliminate gambiense Human African trypanosomiasis?

Polymorphism of Complement Factor H (CFH) is associated with altered risk of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). We aimed to find whether polymorphism of other complement genes altered risk and whether variation of N. meningitidis factor H binding protein (fHBP) affected the risk association. Methods: We undertook a case-control study with 309 European cases and 5, 200 1958 Birth Cohort and National Blood Service cohort controls. We used additive model logistic regression, accepting P&lt;0.05 as significant after correction for multiple testing. The effects of fHBP subfamily on the age at infection and severity of disease was tested using the independent samples median test and Student's T test. The effect of CFH polymorphism on the N. meningitidis fHBP subfamily was investigated by logistic regression and Chi squared test. Results: Rs12085435 A in C8B was associated with odds ratio (OR) of IMD (0.35 [95% CI 0.19-0.67]; P = 0.03 after correction). A CFH haplotype tagged by rs3753396 G was associated with IMD (OR 0.56 [95% CI 0.42-0.76], P = 1.6×10-4). There was no bacterial load (CtrA cycle threshold) difference associated with carriage of this haplotype. Host CFH haplotype and meningococcal fHBP subfamily were not associated. Individuals infected with meningo-cocci expressing subfamily A fHBP were younger than those with subfamily B fHBP menin-gococci (median 1 vs 2 years; P = 0.025). Discussion: The protective CFH haplotype alters odds of IMD without affecting bacterial load for affected heterozygotes. CFH haplotype did not affect the likelihood of infecting meningococci having either fHBP subfamily. The association between C8B rs12085435 and IMD requires independent replication. The CFH association is of interest because it is independent of known functional polymorphisms in CFH. As fHBP-containing vaccines are now in use, relationships between CFH polymorphism and vaccine effectiveness and side-effects may become important. © 2015 Bradley et al.",,"Zipfel, P.F., Complement and immune defense: From innate immunity to human diseases (2009) Immunol Lett, 126, pp. 1-7. , PMID: 19616581; Zipfel, P.F., Skerka, C., Complement regulators and inhibitory proteins (2009) Nat Rev Immunol., 9, pp. 729-740. , PMID: 19730437; Bradley, D.T., Zipfel, P.F., Hughes, A.E., Complement in age-related macular degeneration: A focus on function (2011) Eye, 25, pp. 683-693. , PMID: 21394116; Zipfel, P.F., Hallstrom, T., Hammerschmidt, S., Skerka, C., The complement fitness factor H: Role in human diseases and for immune escape of pathogens, like pneumococci (2008) Vaccine, 26, pp. 67-74; Klein, R.J., Zeiss, C., Chew, E.Y., Tsai, J.Y., Sackler, R.S., Haynes, C., Complement factor H polymorphism in age-related macular degeneration (2005) Science, 308, pp. 385-389. , PMID: 15761122; Haines, J.L., Hauser, M.A., Schmidt, S., Scott, W.K., Olson, L.M., Gallins, P., Complementfactor H variant increases the risk of age-related macular degeneration (2005) Science, 308, pp. 419-421. , PMID: 15761120; Hageman, G.S., Anderson, D.H., Johnson, L.V., Hancox, L.S., Taiber, A.J., Hardisty, L.I., A common haplo-type in the complement regulatory gene factor H (HF1/CFH) predisposes individuals to age-related macular degeneration (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 102, pp. 7227-7232. , PMID: 15870199; Hughes, A.E., Orr, N., Esfandiary, H., Diaz-Torres, M., Goodship, T., Chakravarthy, U., A common CFH haplo-type, with deletion of CFHR1 and CFHR3, is associated with lower risk of age-related macular degeneration (2006) Nat Genet, 38, pp. 1173-1177. , PMID: 16998489; Zipfel, P.F., Edey, M., Heinen, S., Jozsi, M., Richter, H., Misselwitz, J., Deletion of complement factor H-re-lated genes CFHR1 and CFHR3 is associated with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (2007) PLoS Genet, 3, p. e41. , PMID: 17367211; Zhao, J., Wu, H., Khosravi, M., Cui, H., Qian, X., Kelly, J.A., Association of genetic variants in complement factor H and factor H-related genes with systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility (2011) PLoS Genet, 7. , PMID: 21637784; Davila, S., Wright, V.J., Khor, C.C., Sim, K.S., Binder, A., Breunis, W.B., Genome-wide association study identifies variants in the CFH region associated with host susceptibility to meningococcal disease (2010) Nat Genet, 42, pp. 772-776. , PMID: 20694013; Ramsay, M., Kaczmarski, E., Rush, M., Mallard, R., Farrington, P., White, J., Changing patterns of case ascertainment and trends in meningococcal disease in England and wales (1997) Commun Dis Rep CDR Rev, 7, pp. R49-54. , PMID: 9127510; Madico, G., Welsch, J.A., Lewis, L.A., McNaughton, A., Perlman, D.H., Costello, C.E., The meningococcal vaccine candidate GNA1870 binds the complement regulatory protein factor H and enhances serum resistance (2006) J Immunol., 177, pp. 501-510. , PMID: 16785547; Lewis, L.A., Ngampasutadol, J., Wallace, R., Reid, J.E.A., Vogel, U., Ram, S., The meningococcal vaccine candidate neisserial surface protein A (NspA) binds to factor H and enhances meningococcal resistance to complement (2010) PLoS Pathog, 6. , PMID: 20686663; Lewis, L.A., Carter, M., Ram, S., The relative roles of factor H binding protein, neisserial surface protein A, and lipooligosaccharide sialylation in regulation of the alternative pathway of complement on meningococci (2012) J Immunol., 188, pp. 5063-5072. , PMID: 22504643; Dunphy, K.Y., Beernink, P.T., Brogioni, B., Granoff, D.M., Effect of factor H-binding protein sequence variation on factor H binding and survival of neisseria meningitidis in human blood (2011) Infect Immun., 79, pp. 353-359. , PMID: 21041484; Schneider, M.C., Prosser, B.E., Caesar, J.J., Kugelberg, E., Li, S., Zhang, Q., Neisseria meningitidis recruits factor H using protein mimicry of host carbohydrates (2009) Nature, 458, pp. 890-893. , PMID: 19225461; Markiewski, M.M., DeAngelis, R.A., Lambris, J.D., Complexity of complement activation in sepsis (2008) J Cell Mol Med, 12, pp. 2245-2254. , PMID: 18798865; Fletcher, L.D., Bernfield, L., Barniak, V., Farley, J.E., Howell, A., Knauf, M., Vaccine potential of the neisseria meningitidis 2086 lipoprotein (2004) Infect Immun., 72, p. 2088. , Infection and Immunity-2100.

Recent genomewide association studies (GWAS) have shown limited number of novel loci-associations. The rarity and unequal distribution of the disease prevalence amongst different ethnic backgrounds have hampered the use of GWAS in cohorts of mixed ethnicity and sufficient sample size. However, novel statistical approaches have now enabled GWAS in admixed cohorts. Methods: We ran a GWAS on 336 BD cases and 5,843 controls. The cases consisted of Western Europeans, Middle Eastern and Turkish individuals. Participants from the Generation R study, a multiethnic birth cohort in Rotterdam, The Netherlands were used as controls. All samples were genotyped and data was combined. Linear regression models were corrected for population stratification using Genomic Principal Components and Linear Mixed Modelling. Meta-analysis was performed on selected results previously published. Results: We identified SNPs associated at genome-wide significant level mapping to the 6p21.33 (HLA) region. In addition to this known signal two potential novel associations on chromosomes 6 and 18 were identified, yet with low minor allele frequencies. Extended metaanalysis reveal a GWS association with the IL12A variant rs17810546 on chromosome 3. Discussion: We demonstrate that new statistical techniques enable GWAS analyses in a limited sized cohort of mixed ethnicity. After implementation, we confirmed the central role of the HLA region in the disease and identified new regions of interest. Moreover, we validated the association of a variant in the IL2A gene by meta-analysis with previous work. These findings enhance our knowledge of genetic associations and BD, and provide further justification for pursuing collective initiatives in genetic studies given the low prevalence of this and other rare diseases. © 2015 Kappen et al.",,"Sakane, T., Takeno, M., Suzuki, N., Inaba, G., Behcet's disease (1999) The New England Journal of Medicine, 341 (17), pp. 1284-1291. , PMID: 10528040; Gul, A., Behcet's disease: An update on the pathogenesis (2001) Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology, 19 (5), pp. S6-12. , PMID: 11760403; Yazici, H., Fresko, I., Yurdakul, S., Behcet's syndrome: Disease manifestations, management, and advances in treatment (2007) Nature Clinical Practice Rheumatology, 3 (3), pp. 148-155. , PMID: 17334337; Altenburg, A., Mahr, A., Maldini, C., Kneifel, C.E., Krause, L., Kotter, I., Epidemiology and clinical aspects of Adamantiades-Behcet disease in Gemany.

While the exact pathophysiology of preeclampsia is unknown, it is widely accepted that placental dysfunction is mechanistically involved. Recent studies reported aberrant expression of placenta-specific microRNAs (miRNAs) in preeclampsia including miR-517a/b and miR-517c. Using placental biopsies from a preeclampsia case-control study, we found increased expression of miR-517a/b in term and preterm preeclampsia vs controls, while, miR-517c was increased only in preterm preeclampsia vs controls. To determine if miR-517a/b and miR-517c are regulated by hypoxia, we treated first trimester primary extravillous trophoblast cells (EVTs) with a hypoxia mimetic and found both were induced. To test for a mechanistic role in placental function, we overexpressed miR-517a/b or miR-517c in EVTs which resulted in decreased trophoblast invasion. Additionally, we found that miR-517a/b and miR-517c overexpression increased expression of the antiangiogenic protein, sFLT1. The regulation of sFLT1 is mostly unknown, however, TNFSF15, a cytokine involved in FLT1 splicing, was also increased by miR-517a/b and miR-517c in EVTs. In summary, we demonstrate that miR-517a/b and miR-517c contribute to the development of preeclampsia and suggest that these miRNAs play a critical role in regulating trophoblast and placental function. © 2015 Anton et al.",,"Chang, J., Elam-Evans, L.D., Berg, C.J., Herndon, J., Flowers, L., Seed, K.A., Pregnancy-related mortality surveillance-United States, 1991-1999 (2003) MMWR Surveill Summ, 52, pp. 1-8. , PMID: 14647014;

Bannasch, D.L., Department of Population Health and Reproduction, School of Veterinary Medicine University of California, DavisDavis, CA, United States","Cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) is the most commonly occurring craniofacial birth defect. We provide insight into the genetic etiology of this birth defect by performing genome-wide association studies in two species: dogs and humans. In the dog, a genome-wide association study of 7 CL/P cases and 112 controls from the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever (NSDTR) breed identified a significantly associated region on canine chromosome 27 (unadjusted p=1.1 x 10-13; adjusted p= 2.2 x 10-3). Further analysis in NSDTR families and additional full sibling cases identified a 1.44 Mb homozygous haplotype (chromosome 27: 9.29 – 10.73 Mb) segregating with a more complex phenotype of cleft lip, cleft palate, and syndactyly (CLPS) in 13 cases. Whole-genome sequencing of 3 CLPS cases and 4 controls at 15X coverage led to the discovery of a frameshift mutation within ADAMTS20 (c.1360_1361delAA (p.Lys453Ilefs*3)), which segregated concordant with the phenotype. In a parallel study in humans, a family-based association analysis (DFAM) of 125 CL/P cases, 420 unaffected relatives, and 392 controls from a Guatemalan cohort, identified a suggestive association (rs10785430; p =2.67 x 10-6) with the same gene, ADAMTS20. Sequencing of cases from the Guatemalan cohort was unable to identify a causative mutation within the coding region of ADAMTS20, but four coding variants were found in additional cases of CL/P. In summary, this study provides genetic evidence for a role of ADAMTS20 in CL/P development in dogs and as a candidate gene for CL/P development in humans. © 2015 Wolf et al.",,"Rahimov, F., Jugessur, A., Murray, J.C., Genetics of nonsyndromic orofacial clefts (2012) Cleft Palate Craniofacial Journal, 49, pp. 73-91; Wehby, G.L., Cassell, C.H., The impact of orofacial clefts on quality of life and healthcare use and costs (2010) Oral diseases, 16, pp. 3-10; Berk, N.W., Marazita, M.L., Wyszynski, D.F., (2002) Cleft Lip and Palate: From Origin to Treatment; Alkire, B., Hughes, C.D., Nash, K., Vincent, J.R., Meara, J.G., Potential economic benefit of cleft lip and palate repair in sub-Saharan Africa (2011) World J Surg, 35, pp. 1194-1201; Waitzman, N.J., Romano, P.S., Scheffler, R.M., Estimates of the economic costs of birth defects (1994) Inquiry, 31, pp. 188-205; Mossey, P.A., Castilla, E., (2003) Human Genetics Programme, Management of Noncommunicable Diseases; Tanaka, S.A., Mahabir, R.C., Jupiter, D.C., Menezes, J.M., Updating the epidemiology of cleft lip with or without cleft palate (2012) Plast Reconstr Surg, 129, pp. 511-518; Christensen, K., Juel, K., Herskind, A.M., Murray, J.C., Long term follow up study of survival associated with cleft lip and palate at birth (2004) Bmj, 328, p. 1405; Zhu, J.L., Basso, O., Hasle, H., Winther, J.F., Olsen, J.H., Do parents of children with congenital malformations have a higher cancer risk?

However, gravitational effects on lymphopoiesis have rarely been studied. Consequently, we investigated whether the TCRβ repertoire, created by V(D)J recombination during T lymphopoiesis, is affected by hypergravity exposure during murine development. To address this question, C57BL/6j mice were mated in a centrifuge so that embryonic development, birth and TCRβ rearrangements occurred at 2G. Pups were sacrificed at birth, and their thymus used to quantify transcripts coding for factors required for V(D)J recombination and T lymphopoiesis. We also created cDNA mini-libraries of TCRβ transcripts to study the impact of hypergravity on TCRβ diversity. Our data show that hypergravity exposure increases the transcription of TCRβ chains, and of genes whose products are involved in TCR signaling, and affects the V(D)J recombination process. We also observed that ∼85% of the TCRβ repertoire is different between hypergravity and control pups. These data indicate that changing a mechanical force (the gravity) during ontogeny will likely affect host immunity because properties of loops constituting TCR antigen-binding sites are modified in hypergravity newborns. The spectrum of peptides recognized by TCR will therefore likely be different. © 2015, Nature Publishing Group.

The aim of this study was to investigate the birth weight in women with PCOS and its correlation with clinical and biochemical characteristics of the syndrome. Materials and Methods: We studied 288 women with PCOS according to the NIH criteria and 166 women with normal cycle and without clinical hyperandrogenism. Birth weight and anthropometric characteristics were recorded, and levels of serum androgens, SHBG, insulin and fasting glucose were measured. Results: Birth weight data were available for 243/288 women with PCOS and age- and BMI-matched 101/166 controls. No differences were found (p> 0.05) in birth weight among women with PCOS and normal controls. Birth weight of PCOS women was negatively correlated with DHEAS levels (p = 0.031, r = -0.143) and positively correlated with waist circumference (p <0.001, r = 0.297) and body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.040, r = 0.132). Birth weight of controls was negatively correlated with SHBG levels (p = 0.021, r = -0.234). Women from both groups were further divided in 6 categories according to birth weight (A. <2.500 gr, B. 2.501-3.000 gr, C. 3.001-3.500 gr, D. 3.501-4.000 gr, E. 4.001-4.500 gr, F. > 4.500 gr). No statistically significant differences were observed in the distribution percentages between PCOS women and controls. (A. 7% vs 7.9%, B. 26.8%vs 20.8%, C. 39.1%vs 48.5%, D. 21.4% vs 20.8%, E. 4.9% vs 2%, F. 0.8% vs 0%), (in all comparisons, p> 0.05). Conclusions: Women with PCOS do not differ from controls in birth weight distribution. However, birth weight may contribute to subtypes of the syndrome that are characterized by adrenal hyperandrogenism and central obesity. © 2015 Paschou et al.",,"Conway, G., Dewailly, D., Diamanti-Kandarakis, E., Escobar-Morreale, H.F., Franks, S., Gambineri, A., The polycystic ovary syndrome: A position statement from the European Society of Endocrinology (2014) Eur J Endocrinol, 17, pp. P1-P29; Xita, N., Tsatsoulis, A., Fetal origins of the metabolic syndrome (2010) Ann N Y Acad Sci, 1205, pp. 148-155. , PMID: 20840267; De Zegher, F., Ibáñez, L., Early Origins of polycystic ovary syndrome: Hypotheses may change without notice (2009) J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 94, pp. 3682-3685. , PMID: 19808859; Melo, A.S., Vieira, C.S., Barbieri, M.A., Rosa-E-Silva, A.C., Silva, A.A., Cardoso, V.C., High prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome in women born small for gestational age (2010) Hum Reprod, 25, pp. 2124-2131. , PMID: 20573680; Davies, M.J., March, W.A., Willson, K.J., Giles, L.C., Moore, V.M., Birthweight and thinness at birth independently predict symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome in adulthood (2012) Hum Reprod, 27, pp. 1475-1480. , PMID: 22373955; Mumm, H., Kamper-Jørgensen, M., Nybo Andersen, A.M., Glintborg, D., Andersen, M., Birth weight and polycystic ovary syndrome in adult life: A register-based study on 523,757 Danish women born1973-1991 (2013) Fertil Steril, 99, pp. 777-782. , PMID: 23200688; Laitinen, J., Taponen, S., Martikainen, H., Pouta, A., Millwood, I., Hartikainen, A.L., Body size from birth to adulthood as a predictor of self-reported polycystic ovary syndrome symptoms (2003) Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord, 27, pp. 710-715. , PMID: 12833115; Legro, R.S., Roller, R.L., Dodson, W.C., Stetter, C.M., Kunselman, A.R., Dunaif, A., Associations of birth weight and gestational age with reproductive and metabolic phenotypes in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and their first-degree relatives (2010) J Clin Endocrinol Metab, 95, pp. 789-799. , PMID: 19965924; Zawadzki, J.K., Dunaif, A., Diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome; towards a rational approach (1992) Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, pp. 377-384. , Dunaif A, Givens JR, Haseltine F, Merriam G, eds.

The objective of this study was to determine whether skin-to-skin contact of newborns colonized with Methicillin-Oxacillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Methicillin-Oxacillin-Resistant Coagulase-Negative Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/MRSE) with their mothers could be an effective alternative to promote bacterial decolonization of newborns' nostrils. Methods: We performed a randomized clinical trial with 102 newborns admitted to the NICU in three hospitals in São Luís, Brazil. Inclusion criteria were birth weight of 1300 to 1800g, more than 4days of hospitalization, newborns with positive nostril cultures for MRSA and/or multidrug-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and mothers not colonized by these bacteria. We used a random number algorithm for randomization. Allocation was performed using sealed opaque envelopes. Skin-to-skin contact was given twice a day for 60minutes for seven consecutive days. The control group received routine care without skin-to-skin contact. There was no masking of newborn's mothers or researchers but the individuals who carried out bacterial cultures and assessed results were kept blind to group allocation. The primary outcome was colonization status of newborns' nostrils after 7days of intervention. The directional hypothesis was that more newborns who receive skin-to-skin holding 2hours/day for 7days than newborns who receive normal care will be decolonized. Results: Decolonization of MRSA/MRSE was greater in the intervention group (Risk Ratio=2.27; 95% CI 1.27-4.07, p-value=0.003). Number Needed to Treat (NNT) was 4.0 (95% CI 2.2 - 9.4). After adjustment for the possible confounding effects of small for gestational age birth, antibiotic use, need for resuscitation, sex and cesarean delivery, skin-to-skin contact remained strongly associated with decolonization of newborns' nostrils from MRSA/MRSE bacteria (p=0.007). There was no need to interrupt the trial for safety reasons. Conclusion: Skin-to-skin contact might be an effective and safe method for promoting decolonization of newborns' nostrils colonized by MRSA/MRSE. © 2015 Lamy Filho et al.","Decolonization; MRSA/MRSE; Skin-to-skin contact","Huang, Y.C., Chou, Y.H., Su, L.H., Lien, R.I., Lin, T.Y., Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization and its association with infection among infants hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units (2006) Pediatrics, 118, pp. 469-474; Humpheys, H., Can we do better in preventing and controlling methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the intensive care unit (ICU)?

Methods: A total of 311 pregnant women with abnormal 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results were enrolled in this study. Maternal glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADA), islet cell autoantibodies (ICA) and insulin autoantibodies (IAA) were tested in fasting blood both on the day following the routine OGTT and before delivery. The birth weight, Apgar score, blood glucose and outcomes of each neonate were later evaluated and recorded. Results: 1. In this study, 33.9%of the pregnant women with gestational hyperglycemia had detectable levels of one or more types of anti-islet cell antibodies in the third trimester. The proportion of women who produced GADA and/or ICA was significantly higher in the group of women with gestational hyperglycemia than in the control group (P<0.05). The groups similarly differed in the proportion of women who tested positive for any anti-islet cell antibody (P<0.05). 2. Of the patients in our study, those who produced GADA exhibited an increase in uterine and umbilical arterial pulsatility indexes (PIs) during the third trimesters compared with the control group (P 0.05). Additionally, an increased frequency of fetal growth restriction (FGR) was observed in the infants of women who produced IAA during pregnancy compared with those without autoantibodies (P 0.05). 3. The rate of newborn admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was significantly associated with the presence of maternal ICA during the third trimester (OR, 6.36; 95% CI, 1.22-33.26). 4. The incidence of neonatal asphyxia was associated with the presence of maternal GADA in both the second (OR, 10.44; 95% CI, 1.46-74.92) and the third (OR, 8.33; 95% CI, 1.45-47.82) trimesters. Conclusion: Approximately one-third of the women with gestational hyperglycemia produced anti-islet cell antibodies. The incidence of FGR was higher in women with gestational hyperglycemia who produced IAA than in those without autoantibodies. Maternal ICA production in the third trimester was a risk factor for the subsequent admission of newborns to the NICU. Furthermore, the presence of maternal GADA placed the neonate at increased risk for asphyxia. © 2015 Zhe et al.",,"Lapolla, A., Dalfra, M.G., Fedele, D., Diabetes related autoimmunity in gestational diabetes mellitus: Is it important?

Option B provides ART through pregnancy and breastfeeding, whereas Option B+ recommends continuous ART regardless of CD4 count, thus potentially reducing MTCT during future pregnancies. Our objective was to compare maternal and pediatric health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of Option B+ versus Option B in Ghana. Methods: A decision-analytic model was developed to simulate HIV progression in mothers and transmission (in utero, during birth, or through breastfeeding) to current and all future children. Clinical parameters, including antenatal care access and fertility rates, were estimated from a retrospective review of 817 medical records at two hospitals in Ghana. Additional parameters were obtained from published literature. Modeled outcomes include HIV infections averted among newborn children, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness ratios. Results: HIV-infected women in Ghana have a lifetime average of 2.3 children (SD 1.3). Projected maternal life expectancy under Option B+ is 16.1years, versus 16.0years with Option B, yielding a gain of 0.1 maternal QALYs and 3.2 additional QALYs per child. Despite higher initial ART costs, Option B+ costs $785/QALY gained, a value considered very cost-effective by World Health Organization benchmarks. Widespread implementation of Option B+ in Ghana could theoretically prevent up to 668 HIV infections among children annually. Cost-effectiveness estimates remained favorable over robust sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Although more expensive than Option B, Option B+ substantially reduces MTCT in future pregnancies, increases both maternal and pediatric QALYs, and is a cost-effective use of limited resources in Ghana. © VanDeusen et al.","Cost-effectiveness analysis; HIV prevention; Mathematical model; Mother-to-child HIV transmission","(2012) World AIDS Day Report, , http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/epidemiology/2012/gr2012/JC2434_WorldAIDSday_results_en.pdf; Eliminating new HIV infections among children http://www.unaids.org/en/targetsandcommitments/eliminatingnewhivinfectionamongchildren/Global Monitoring Framework and Strategy for the Global Plan towards the elimination of new HIV infections among children by 2015 and keeping their mothers alive (EMTCT).

Here, we conduct a case-control-based GWAS followed by two rounds of replication; we include six independent cohorts from China to elucidate the genetic architecture of NSCL/P in Chinese populations. Using this combined analysis, we identify a new locus at 16p13.3 associated with NSCL/P: rs8049367 between CREBBP and ADCY9 (odds ratio=0.74, P=8.98 × 10 -12). We confirm that the reported loci at 1q32.2, 10q25.3, 17p13.1 and 20q12 are also involved in NSCL/P development in Chinese populations. Our results provide additional evidence that the rs2235371-related haplotype at 1q32.2 could play a more important role than the previously identified causal variant rs642961 in Chinese populations. These findings provide information on the genetic basis and mechanisms of NSCL/P. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Sustained inflation (SI) combined with positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) may be a superior method of aerating the lung compared with intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) with PEEP in extremely preterm infants. The Sustained Aeration of Infant Lungs (SAIL) trial was designed to study this question. Methods/Design: This multisite prospective randomized controlled unblinded trial will recruit 600 infants of 23 to 26 weeks gestational age who require respiratory support at birth. Infants in both arms will be treated with PEEP 5 to 7 cm H2O throughout the resuscitation. The study intervention consists of performing an initial SI (20 cm H20 for 15 seconds) followed by a second SI (25 cm H2O for 15 seconds), and then PEEP with or without IPPV, as needed. The control group will be treated with initial IPPV with PEEP. The primary outcome is the combined endpoint of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death at 36 weeks post-menstrual age. © Foglia et al.","Bronchopulmonary dysplasia; Continuous positive airway pressure; Preterm infants; Resuscitation; Sustained inflation","Vyas, H., Field, D., Milner, A.D., Hopkin, I.E., Determinants of the first inspiratory volume and functional residual capacity at birth (1986) Pediatr Pulmonol, 2, pp. 189-193; Heldt, G.P., McIlroy, M.B., Distortion of chest wall and work of diaphragm in preterm infants (1987) J Appl Physiol, 62, pp. 164-169; Heldt, G.P., McIlroy, M.B., Dynamics of chest wall in preterm infants (1987) J Appl Physiol, 62, pp. 170-174; Deoras, K.S., Greenspan, J.S., Wolfson, M.R., Keklikian, E.N., Shaffer, T.H., Allen, J.L., Effects of inspiratory resistive loading on chest wall motion and ventilation: Differences between preterm and full-term infants (1992) Pediatr Res, 32, pp. 589-594; Obladen, M., Factors influencing surfactant composition in the newborn infant (1978) Eur J Pediatr, 128, pp. 129-143; Respiratory support in preterm infants at birth (2014) Pediatrics, 133, pp. 171-174; Finer, N.N., Carlo, W.A., Walsh, M.C., Rich, W., Gantz, M.G., Laptook, A.R., Early CPAP versus surfactant in extremely preterm infants (2010) N Engl J Med, 362, pp. 1970-1979; Morley, C.J., Davis, P.G., Doyle, L.W., Brion, L.P., Hascoet, J.-M., Carlin, J.B., COIN Trial Investigators.

Periodic clinical audits are required to inform and update health care protocols. This study aimed to review morbidity and mortality in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in 2013 compared with similar data from 2006/2007. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients' records from a neonatal computer database for 562 VLBW infants. These neonates weighed between 500 and 1500g at birth, and were admitted within 48hours after birth between 01 January 2013 and 31 December 2013. Patients' characteristics, complications of prematurity, and therapeutic interventions were compared with 2006/2007 data. Univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression were performed to establish significant associations of various factors with survival to discharge for 2013. Results: Survival in 2013 was similar to that in 2006/2007 (73.4% vs 70.2%, p=0.27). However, survival in neonates who weighed 750-900g significantly improved from 20.4% in 2006/2007 to 52.4% in 2013 (p=0.001). The use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) increased from 20.3% to 62.9% and surfactant use increased from 19.2% to 65.5% between the two time periods (both p<0.001). Antenatal care attendance improved from 54.4% to 70.6% (p=0.001) and late onset sepsis (>72hours after birth) increased from 12.5% to 19% (p=0.006) between the two time periods. Other variables remained unchanged between 2006/2007 and 2013. The main determinants of survival to discharge in 2013 were birth weight (odds ratio 1.005, 95% confidence interval 1.003-1.0007, resuscitation at birth (2.673, 1.375-5.197), NCPAP (0.247, 0.109-0.560), necrotising enterocolitis (4.555, 1.659-12.51), and mode of delivery, including normal vaginal delivery (0.456, 0.231-0.903) and vaginal breech (0.069, 0.013-0.364). Conclusions: There was a marked improvement in the survival of neonates weighing between 750 and 900g at birth, most likely due to provision of surfactant and NCPAP. Provision of NCPAP, prevention of necrotising enterocolitis, and control of infection need to be prioritised in VLBW infants to improve their outcome. © Ballot et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Infant; Neonatal mortality; Premature; Very low birth weight","(2013), http://www.who.int/gho/child_health/mortality/neonatal_text/en/Wang, H., Liddell, C.A., Coates, M.M., Mooney, M.D., Levitz, C.E., Schumacher, A.E., Global, regional, and national levels of neonatal, infant, and under-5 mortality during 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (2014) Lancet; Velaphi, S.C., Rhoda, N., Reducing neonatal deaths in South Africa - are we there yet and what can be done?

Preterm babies of mothers with early onset preeclampsia (EOPE) are at higher risks for various diseases later on in life, including cardiovascular diseases. We hypothesized that genome-wide epigenetic alterations occur in cord blood DNAs in association with EOPE and conducted a case control study to compare the genome-scale methylome differences in cord blood DNAs between 12 EOPE-associated and 8 normal births. Results: Bioinformatics analysis of methylation data from the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip shows a genome-scale hypomethylation pattern in EOPE, with 51,486 hypomethylated CpG sites and 12,563 hypermethylated sites (adjusted P <0.05). A similar trend also exists in the proximal promoters (TSS200) associated with protein-coding genes. Using summary statistics on the CpG sites in TSS200 regions, promoters of 643 and 389 genes are hypomethylated and hypermethylated, respectively. Promoter-based differential methylation (DM) analysis reveals that genes in the farnesoid X receptor and liver X receptor (FXR/LXR) pathway are enriched, indicating dysfunction of lipid metabolism in cord blood cells. Additional biological functional alterations involve inflammation, cell growth, and hematological system development. A two-way ANOVA analysis among coupled cord blood and amniotic membrane samples shows that a group of genes involved in inflammation, lipid metabolism, and proliferation are persistently differentially methylated in both tissues, including IL12B, FAS, PIK31, and IGF1. Conclusions: These findings provide, for the first time, evidence of prominent genome-scale DNA methylation modifications in cord blood DNAs associated with EOPE. They may suggest a connection between inflammation and lipid dysregulation in EOPE-associated newborns and a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases later in adulthood. © 2015 Ching et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Bioinformatics; Cord blood; DNA methylation; Epigenetics; Preeclampsia","Srinivas, S.K., Edlow, A.G., Neff, P.M., Sammel, M.D., Rela, C.M., Elovitz, M.A., Rethinking IUGR in preeclampsia: Dependent or independent of maternal hypertension?

The study controls, by means of coarsened exact matching, for a set of individual, firm and context variables that have been found to impact on firm survival prospects. They include attributes of the owner (age and gender) and contextual conditions (industry and year of the start-up). Results suggest that, all other individual and environmental factors being equal, migrant-owned firms generally have better survival prospects than their native-owned counterparts. More in detail, compared to Italian-owned firms, business run by individuals born in Egypt, Morocco, Peru and Albania display significantly lower failure rates; only Chinese-owned firms are less likely to endure.

The most common cancer in males under age 40, age period cohort models have posited exposures in the in utero environment or in early childhood as possible causes of increased risk of testicular cancer. Some of these factors may be tied to geography through being associated with behavioral, cultural, sociodemographic or built environment characteristics. If so, this could result in detectable geographic clusters of cases that could lead to hypotheses regarding environmental targets for intervention. Given a latency period between exposure to an environmental carcinogen and testicular cancer diagnosis, mobility histories are beneficial for spatial cluster analyses. Nearest-neighbor based Q-statistics allow for the incorporation of changes in residency in spatial disease cluster detection. Using these methods, a spacetime cluster analysis was conducted on a population-wide case-control population selected from the Danish Cancer Registry with mobility histories since 1971 extracted from the Danish Civil Registration System. Cases (N=3297) were diagnosed between 1991 and 2003, and two sets of controls (N=3297 for each set) matched on sex and date of birth were included in the study. We also examined spatial patterns in maternal residential history for those cases and controls born in 1971 or later (N= 589 case-control pairs). Several small clusters were detected when aligning individuals by year prior to diagnosis, age at diagnosis and calendar year of diagnosis. However, the largest of these clusters contained only 2 statistically significant individuals at their center, and were not replicated in SaTScan spatial-only analyses which are less susceptible to multiple testing bias. We found little evidence of local clusters in residential histories of testicular cancer cases in this Danish population. © 2015 Sloan et al.",,"Rosen, A., Jayram, G., Drazer, M., Eggener, S.E., Global trends in testicular cancer incidence and mortality (2011) Eur Urol., 60, pp. 374-379. , PMID: 21612857; Ekbom, A., Akre, O., Increasing incidence of testicular cancer-birth cohort effects (1998) Apmis., 106, pp. 225-231. , PMID: 9524583; Myrup, C., Wohlfahrt, J., Oudin, A., Schnack, T., Melbye, M., Risk of testicular cancer according to birthplace and birth cohort in Denmark (2010) International Journal of Cancer, 126, pp. 217-223. , PMID: 19588505; McGlynn, K.A., Devesa, S.S., Sigurdson, A.J., Brown, L.M., Tsao, L., Tarone, R.E., Trends in the incidence of testicular germ cell tumors in the United States (2003) Cancer., 97, pp. 63-70. , PMID: 12491506; Schmiedel, S., Schüz, J., Skakkebæk, N.E., Johansen, C., Testicular germ cell cancer incidence in an immigration perspective, Denmark, 1978 to 2003 (2010) J Urol., 183, pp. 1378-1382. , PMID: 20171682; Jacobsen, R., Møller, H., Thoresen S.Ø., Pukkala, E., Kjaer, S.K., Johansen, C., Trends in testicular cancer incidence in the Nordic countries, focusing on the recent decrease in Denmark (2006) Int J Androl., 29, pp. 199-204. , PMID: 16371112; Wood, H.M., Elder, J.S., Cryptorchidism and testicular cancer: Separating fact from fiction (2009) J Urol., 181, pp. 452-461. , PMID: 19084853; Prener, A., Engholm, G., Jensen, O.M., Genital anomalies and risk for testicular cancer in Danish men (1996) Epidemiology., 7, pp. 14-19. , PMID: 8664395; Nordsborg, R.B., Meliker, J.R., Wohlfahrt, J., Melbye, M., Raaschou-Nielsen, O., Cancer in first-degree relatives and risk of testicular cancer in Denmark (2011) Int J Cancer, 129, pp. 2485-2491. , PMID: 21207375; Ruark, E., Seal, S., McDonald, H., Zhang, F., Elliot, A., Lau, K.W., Identification of nine new susceptibility loci for testicular cancer, including variants near DAZL and PRDM14 (2013) Nat Genet., 45, pp. 686-689. , PMID: 23666240; Valberg, M., Grotmol, T., Tretli, S., Veierød, M.B., Moger, T.A., Aalen, O.O., A hierarchical frailty model for familial testicular germ-cell tumors (2014) Am J Epidemiol., 179, pp. 499-506. , PMID: 24219863; Brown, L.M., Pottern, L.M., Hoover, R.N., Prenatal and perinatal risk factors for testicular cancer (1986) Cancer Res., 46, pp. 4812-4816. , PMID: 3731127; Ekbom, A., Growing evidence that several human cancers (1998) Semin Cancer Biol, 4, pp. 237-244. , may originate in utero PMID: 9870030; McKiernan, J.M., Goluboff, E.T., Liberson, G.L., Golden, R., Fisch, H., Rising risk of testicular cancer by birth cohort in the United States from 1973 to 1995 (1999) J Urol., 162, pp. 361-363. , PMID: 10411039; Toledano, M., Jarup, L., Best, N., Wakefield, J., Elliott, P., Spatial variation and temporal trends of testicular cancer in Great Britain (2001) Br J Cancer., 84, p. 1482. , PMID: 11384098; Levine, P.H., Hashmi, S., Minaei, A.A., Veneroso, C., Inflammatory breast cancer clusters: A hypothesis (2014) World J Clin Oncol., 5, p. 539. , PMID: 25114867; Goodman, M., Naiman, J.S., Goodman, D., LaKind, J.S., Comments on "" Cancer clusters in the USA: What do the last twenty years of state and federal investigations tell us?

It has been suggested that some aspects of intelligence are preserved or even superior in people with ASD compared with controls, but consistent evidence is lacking. Few studies have examined the genetic overlap between cognitive ability and ASD/ADHD. The aim of this study was to examine the polygenic overlap between ASD/ADHD and cognitive ability in individuals from the general population. Polygenic risk for ADHD and ASD was calculated from genome-wide association studies of ASD and ADHD conducted by the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium. Risk scores were created in three independent cohorts: Generation Scotland Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) (n=9863), the Lothian Birth Cohorts 1936 and 1921 (n=1522), and the Brisbane Adolescent Twin Sample (BATS) (n=921). We report that polygenic risk for ASD is positively correlated with general cognitive ability (beta=0.07, P=6 × 10-7, r2=0.003), logical memory and verbal intelligence in GS:SFHS. This was replicated in BATS as a positive association with full-scale intelligent quotient (IQ) (beta=0.07, P=0.03, r2=0.005). We did not find consistent evidence that polygenic risk for ADHD was associated with cognitive function; however, a negative correlation with IQ at age 11 years (beta=−0.08, Z=−3.3, P=0.001) was observed in the Lothian Birth Cohorts. These findings are in individuals from the general population, suggesting that the relationship between genetic risk for ASD and intelligence is partly independent of clinical state. These data suggest that common genetic variation relevant for ASD influences general cognitive ability.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 10 March 2015; doi:10.1038/mp.2015.12. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924368249

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been reported to improve pregnancy rates and lower miscarriage rates in women with diminished ovarian function. This study was planned to evaluate whether pretreatment with DHEA may improve in vitro fertilization (IVF) parameters and pregnancy outcomes in infertile women with advanced reproductive age and normal ovarian reserve. Methods: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 109 infertile patients aging 36-40 years old were selected to undergo the long protocol IVF. Eight weeks before starting the IVF cycle and during treatment, patients in Group 1 received 75 mg of DHEA once a day; patients in control group (Group 2) received placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was number of clinical pregnancy, live birth and miscarriage rates; secondary endpoint was modification of standard IVF parameters, including stimulation duration (days of rhFSH administration), E2 on HCG-day, endometrial thickness, number of retrieved oocytes, metaphase II oocytes, number of transferred embryos and score of leading embryos transferred. Results: Patients in the DHEA group had a significantly higher live birth rate compared with controls (P < 0.05). Conversely, miscarriage rate was higher for patients in the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: DHEA supplementation may significantly improve IVF outcomes in infertile women with advanced reproductive age and normal ovarian reserve. © Tartagni et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA); IVF parameters; Pregnancy rate","Cabry, R., Merviel, P., Hazout, A., Belloc, S., Dalleac, A., Copin, H., Management of infertility in women over 40 (2014) Maturitas, 78, pp. 17-21; Arlt, W., Dehydroepiandrosterone and ageing (2004) Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab, 18, pp. 363-380; Yakin, K., Urman, B., DHEA as a miracle drug in the treatment of poor responders; hype or hope?

Both ultimately result from a deficiency of functional pancreatic insulin-producing beta cells. Beta cells proliferate in humans during a brief temporal window beginning around the time of birth, with a peak percentage (∼2%) engaged in the cell cycle in the first year of life. In embryonic life and after early childhood, beta cell replication is barely detectable. Whereas beta cell expansion seems an obvious therapeutic approach to beta cell deficiency, adult human beta cells have proven recalcitrant to such efforts. Hence, there remains an urgent need for antidiabetic therapeutic agents that can induce regeneration and expansion of adult human beta cells in vivo or ex vivo. Here, using a high-throughput small-molecule screen (HTS), we find that analogs of the small molecule harmine function as a new class of human beta cell mitogenic compounds. We also define dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase-1a (DYRK1A) as the likely target of harmine and the nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors as likely mediators of human beta cell proliferation and differentiation. Using three different mouse and human islet in vivo–based models, we show that harmine is able to induce beta cell proliferation, increase islet mass and improve glycemic control. These observations suggest that harmine analogs may have unique therapeutic promise for human diabetes therapy. Enhancing the potency and beta cell specificity of these compounds are important future challenges. © 2015 Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Cork, Ireland","Background: Excessive maternal weight gain during pregnancy impacts on offspring health. This study focused on the timing of maternal gestational weight gain, using a porcine model with mothers of normal pre-pregnancy weight. Methods: Trial design ensured the trajectory of maternal gestational weight gain differed across treatments in early, mid and late gestation. Diet composition did not differ. On day 25 gestation, sows were assigned to one of five treatments: Control sows received a standard gestation diet of 2.3 kg/day (30 MJ DE/day) from early to late gestation (day 25-110 gestation). E sows received 4.6 kg food/day in early gestation (day 25-50 gestation). M sows doubled their food intake in mid gestation (day 50-80 gestation). EM sows doubled their food intake during both early and mid gestation (day 25-80 gestation). L sows consumed 3.5 kg food/day in late gestation (day 80-110 gestation). Offspring body weight and food intake levels were measured from birth to adolescence. Markers of lipid metabolism, hypertrophy and inflammation were investigated in subcutaneous adipose tissue of adolescent offspring. Results: The trajectory of gestational weight gain differed across treatments. However total gestational weight gain did not differ except for EM sows who were the heaviest and fattest mothers at parturition. Offspring birth weight did not differ across treatments. Subcutaneous adipose tissue from EM offspring differed significantly from controls, with elevated mRNA levels of lipogenic (CD36, ACACB and LPL), nutrient transporters (FABP4 and GLUT4), lipolysis (HSL and ATGL), adipocyte size (MEST) and inflammation (PAI-1) indicators. The subcutaneous adipose depot from L offspring exhibited elevated levels of CD36, ACACB, LPL, GLUT4 and FABP4 mRNA transcripts compared to control offspring. Conclusions: Increasing gestational weight gain in early gestation had the greatest impact on offspring postnatal growth rate. Increasing maternal food allowance in late gestation appeared to shift the offspring adipocyte focus towards accumulation of fat. Mothers who gained the most weight during gestation (EM mothers) gave birth to offspring whose subcutaneous adipose tissue, at adolescence, appeared hyperactive compared to controls. This study concluded that mothers, who gained more than the recommended weight gain in mid and late gestation, put their offspring adipose tissue at risk of dysfunction. © 2015 Giblin et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Gestational weight gain; Maternal food intake; Subcutaneous adipose tissue",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928746029

Here, we will investigate whether newborn piglets gavaged with a vaccine comprised of OVA plus unmethylated CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG; soluble component; OVA/CpG) combined with OVA plus CpG encapsulated within polyphosphazene microparticles (MP; particulate component) responded with systemic and mucosal immunity. To monitor the response to systemic antigen re-exposure, piglets were i.p.-immunized with OVA plus Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) one month later. Results: Newborn piglets (n = 5/group) were gavaged with a combined soluble and particulate vaccine consisting of OVA (0.5-0.05 mg) plus 50 μg CpG and 0.5 mg OVA plus 50 μg CpG encapsulated within a polyphosphazene MP (0.5 mg) referred to as OVA/CpG + MP. Control piglets were gavaged with saline alone. Piglets were i.p. immunized with 10 mg OVA (or saline) in IFA at four weeks of age and then euthanized at eight weeks of age. We observed significantly higher titres of serum anti-OVA immunoglobulin (Ig) IgM, IgA, IgG, IgG1, IgG2 and IgG in piglets immunized with 0.05 mg OVA/CpG + MP relative to saline control animals. Thus, a single oral exposure at birth to a combined soluble and particulate OVA vaccine including adjuvants can circumvent induction of oral tolerance which impacts response to i.p. vaccination in later life. Further, piglets gavaged with 0.05 mg OVA/CpG + MP generated significant anti-OVA IgG and IgG1 titres in lung compared to saline control piglets but results were comparable to titres measured in parenteral control piglets. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) ex vivo-stimulated with OVA showed markedly decreased production of IL-10 cytokine after 72 hours relative to animal-matched cells incubated with media alone. No production of IFN-γ was observed from any groups. Conclusion: Newborn piglets gavaged with low dose soluble and particulate OVA plus CpG ODN and polyphosphazene adjuvants produced antigen-specific antibodies in serum and lung after systemic re-exposure in later life. These data indicate circumvention of oral tolerance but not induction of oral immunity. © 2015 Pasternak et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Neonate; Oral; Ovalbumin; Piglets; Tolerance",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928743085

Task acquisition, working memory error (WME), and reference memory error (RME) were assessed in an eight-arm radial maze task. Behavioral performance of rats was also tested in an open field test before (P35–P40) and after (P65–P70) radial maze training to assess anxiety and locomotion. EE was applied from birth up to the end of experiments.Results: MK-801 treatment did not influence task acquisition in the radial maze; however, by the end of training, MK-801-treated rats made significantly more WME, but not RME, compared to control rats. Ratio of WME to total error was also significantly higher in MK-801 group. EE prevented MK-801-associated behaviors in the open field but did not exert beneficial effects on working memory deficit in the radial maze task. EE per se affected behavioral performance of rats only in the open field test.Conclusions: Our results suggest that postnatal MK-801 treatment differentially affects working and reference memory in a young brain. Anxiety and hyperactivity associated with MK-801 are observed more severely in adulthood.

However, return to fertility is variable in the postpartum period and is contingent upon numerous factors. The postpartum period is therefore a critical time to initiate effective contraception in order to support the numerous beneficial health outcomes of optimal pregnancy spacing. Breastfeeding women have an unmet need for highly effective birth control methods that do not interfere with lactation and that are safe for their infants. The progesterone-releasing vaginal ring (PVR) releases a natural progesterone that suppresses ovulation and is specifically designed for breastfeeding women in the first postpartum year. Objective: To review the published peer-reviewed literature regarding the safety and effectiveness of the PVR used for contraception among lactating women, as well as the safety for their infants. Results of this review informed the decisions of the Guideline Development Group to include recommendations on contraceptive eligibility for the PVR within the World Health Organization Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, 5th Edition. Methods: We searched the PubMed, Popline, and LILACS bibliographic databases for articles published in any language from database inception through October 1, 2014. We reviewed the literature for evidence regarding the safety of the PVR among breastfeeding women using the method, as well as for their infants. The US Preventive Services Task Force system was applied to assess the quality of the evidence. Results: Seven articles met our criteria for inclusion in this review. All studies were of a prospective cohort design. All studies consistently showed that use of the PVR among breastfeeding women compares favorably to other methods of contraception with regard to effectiveness, does not compromise a woman's breastfeeding performance, and does not adversely affect infant growth during the first year postpartum. Conclusion: The PVR is a safe and highly effective method of contraception for use among breastfeeding women. It should be offered to women who plan to breastfeed in the context of postpartum contraceptive counseling. © 2015.","Breastfeeding; Contraception; Lactation; Progesterone vaginal ring",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928975289

We therefore aimed to determine whether whole brain white matter microstructure differs between moderate and late preterm infants and term-born controls at term-equivalent age, as well as to identify potential perinatal risk factors for white matter microstructural alterations in moderate and late preterm infants. Whole brain white matter microstructure was studied in 193 moderate and late preterm infants and 83 controls at term-equivalent age by performing Tract-Based Spatial Statistics analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data. Moderate and late preterm infants had lower fractional anisotropy and higher mean, axial and radial diffusivities compared with controls in nearly 70 % of the brain’s major white matter fiber tracts. In the moderate and late preterm group, being born small for gestational age and male sex were associated with lower fractional anisotropy, largely within the optic radiation, corpus callosum and corona radiata. In conclusion, moderate and late preterm infants exhibit widespread brain white matter microstructural alterations compared with controls at term-equivalent age, in patterns consistent with delayed or disrupted white matter microstructural development. These findings may underpin some of the neurodevelopmental delays observed in moderate and late preterm children. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Diffusion tensor imaging; Late preterm; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neonate; Preterm birth; Tract-based spatial statistics",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924129262

Alterations in these parameters can persist into adulthood and low birth weight can lead to altered fetal programming. Glutamine has been associated with the synthesis of other amino acids, an increase in protein synthesis and it is used clinically as a nutrient supplement for low birth weight infants. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of repeated maternal alcohol exposure and l-glutamine supplementation on fetal growth and amino acid bioavailability during the third trimester-equivalent period in an ovine model. Pregnant sheep were randomly assigned to four groups, saline control, alcohol (1.75–2.5 g/kg), glutamine (100 mg/kg, three times daily) or alcohol + glutamine. In this study, a weekend binge drinking model was followed where treatment was done 3 days per week in succession from gestational day (GD) 109–132 (normal term ~147). Maternal alcohol exposure significantly reduced fetal body weight, height, length, thoracic girth and brain weight, and resulted in decreased amino acid bioavailability in fetal plasma and placental fluids. Maternal glutamine supplementation successfully mitigated alcohol-induced fetal growth restriction and improved the bioavailability of glutamine and glutamine-related amino acids such as glycine, arginine, and asparagine in the fetal compartment. All together, these findings show that l-glutamine supplementation enhances amino acid availability in the fetus and prevents alcohol-induced fetal growth restriction. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Wien","Alcohol; FASD; Fetal growth; Glutamine; IUGR",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924187591

Based on the potential applicability of and to further explore the ""similarities in the inequalities"" phenomenon, this study used a rat model to investigate the effect of different nutritional backgrounds during gestation on the willingness of offspring to engage in physical activity in adulthood. Sprague-Dawley rats were time mated and randomly allocated to one of three dietary groups: Control (Adlib), receiving standard laboratory chow ad libitum; 50% food restricted (FR), receiving 50% of the ad libitum-fed dam's habitual intake; or high-fat diet (HF), receiving a diet containing 23% fat. The diets were provided from day 10 of pregnancy until weaning. Within 24 hours of birth, pups were cross-fostered to other dams, forming the following groups: Adlib-Adlib, FR-Adlib, and HF-Adlib. Maternal chow consumption and weight gain, and offspring birth weight, growth, physical activity (one week of free exercise in running wheels), abdominal adiposity and biochemical data were evaluated. Western blot was performed to assess D2 receptors in the dorsal striatum. The ""similarities in the inequalities"" effect was observed on birth weight (both FR and HF groups were smaller than the Adlib group at birth) and physical activity (both FR-Adlib and HF-Adlib groups were different from the Adlib-Adlib group, with less active males and more active females). Our findings contribute to the view that health inequalities in fetal life may program the health outcomes manifested in offspring adult life (such as altered physical activity and metabolic parameters), probably through different biological mechanisms.

Other than clinical description and pathological examination, the underlying causes have, for the most part, remained unknown. A single case of congenital skin fragility in cattle was observed, necropsy, histological and ultrastructural examinations were carried out and whole genome sequencing was utilized to identify the causative mutation. Results: A single purebred female Charolais calf with severe skin lesions was delivered full-term and died spontaneously after birth. The clinical and pathological findings exactly matched the gross description given by previous reports on epitheliogenesis imperfecta and epidermolysis bullosa (EB) in cattle. Histological and ultrastructural changes were consistent with EB junctionalis (EBJ). Genetic analysis revealed a previously unpublished ITGB4 loss-of-function mutation; the affected calf was homozygous for a 4.4 kb deletion involving exons 17 to 22, and the dam carried a single copy of the deletion indicating recessive inheritance. The homozygous mutant genotype did not occur in healthy controls of various breeds but some heterozygous carriers were found among Charolais cattle belonging to the affected herd. The mutant allele was absent in a representative sample of unrelated sires of the German Charolais population. Conclusion: This is the first time in which a recessively inherited ITGB4 associated EBJ has been reported in cattle. The identification of heterozygous carriers is of importance in avoiding the transmission of this defect in future. Current DNA sequencing methods offer a powerful tool for understanding the genetic background of rare diseases in domestic animals having a reference genome sequence available. © 2015 Peters et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Cattle; Integrin beta 4, ITGB4; Junctional epidermolysis bullosa; Rare genetic disease; Skin fragility; Whole genome sequencing",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928726317

Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) is an autoantibody involved in autoimmune thyroiditis. We aimed to test the a priori hypothesis that positivity to maternal serum TPO-Ab (TPO-Ab. +) (defined as >. 156. IU/ml) during pregnancy is related to childhood autism. Method: The study was based on a nested case-control design of the Finnish Prenatal Study of Autism (FiPS-A), a national birth cohort that includes prospectively drawn archived maternal serum specimens from virtually the entire pregnant population of Finland beginning in 1983. Cases of childhood autism (ICD-10F84.0) born from 1987 to 2005 were ascertained by performing linkages between national birth and inpatient/outpatient registries. All diagnosed cases in Finland over the birth years, and comparison subjects without ASD or severe/profound intellectual disability were matched 1:1 on date of birth, sex, birthplace, and residence in Finland. Maternal serum specimens were assayed in 967 matched case-control pairs for TPO-Ab by a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay blind to case/control status. Data were analyzed by conditional logistic regression for matched sets. Results: The prevalence of maternal TPO-Ab. + was significantly increased in pregnancies giving rise to autism cases (6.15%) compared to controls (3.54%). The odds of autism were increased by nearly 80% among offspring of mothers who were TPO-Ab. + during pregnancy (OR. =. 1.78, 95% CI. =. 1.16-2.75, p=. 0.009), compared to mothers negative for this autoantibody. There was also a significant relationship between maternal TPO-Ab defined as a continuous variable and odds of autism (OR. =. 1.09, 95% CI. =. 1.01, 1.17, p=. 0.02). Measures of maternal thyroid hormones did not differ between groups. Conclusions: These findings provide the first biomarker-based evidence that a class of known maternal autoimmune disorders is related to autism in offspring. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Autism; Autoantibody; Autoimmune; Birth cohort; Epidemiology; Thyroid","Abel, K.M., Dalman, C., Svensson, A.C., Susser, E., Dal, H., Idring, S., Deviance in fetal growth and risk of autism spectrum disorder (2013) Am J Psychiatry, 170, pp. 391-398; Andersen, S.L., Laurberg, P., Wu, C.S., Olsen, J., Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder in children born to mothers with thyroid dysfunction: a Danish nationwide cohort study (2014) BJOG, 121, pp. 1365-1374; Atladóttir, H.O., Pedersen, M.G., Thorsen, P., Mortensen, P.B., Deleuran, B., Eaton, W.W., Association of family history of autoimmune diseases and autism spectrum disorders (2009) Pediatrics, 124, pp. 687-694; Atladóttir, H.O., Thorsen, P., Schendel, D.E., Østengaard, L., Lemcke, S., Parner, E.T., Association of hospitalization for infection in childhood with diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (2010) Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med, 164, pp. 470-477; Braunschweig, D., van De Water, J., Maternal autoantibodies in autism (2012) Arch Neurol, 69, pp. 693-699; Braunschweig, D., Ashwood, P., Krakowiak, P., Hertz-Picciotto, I., Hansen, R., Croen, L.A., Autism: maternally derived antibodies specific for fetal brain proteins (2008) Neurotoxicology, 29, pp. 226-231; Braunschweig, D., Duncanson, P., Boyce, R., Hansen, R., Ashwood, P., Pessah, I.N., Behavioral correlates of maternal antibody status among children with autism (2012) J Autism Dev Disord, 42, pp. 1435-1445; Brimberg, L., Sadiq, A., Gregersen, P.K., Diamond, B., Brain-reactive IgG correlates with autoimmunity in mothers of a child with autism spectrum disorder (2013) Mol Psychiatry, 18, pp. 1171-1177; Cheslack-Postava, K., Jokiranta, E., Suominen, A., Lehti, V., Sourander, A.S., Brown, A.S., Variation by diagnostic subtype in risk for autism spectrum disorders associated with maternal parity among Finnish births (2014) Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol, 28, pp. 58-66; Comi, A.M., Zimmerman, A.W., Frye, V.H., Law, P.A., Peeden, J.N., Familiar clustering of autoimmune disorders and evaluation of medical risk factors in autism (1999) J Child Neurol, 14, pp. 388-394; Crespi, B.J., Thiselton, D.L., Comparative immunogenetics of autism and schizophrenia (2011) Genes Brain Behav, 10, pp. 689-701; Croen, L.A., Grether, J.K., Yoshida, C.K., Odouli, R., van De Water, J., Maternal autoimmune disease, asthma and allergies, and childhood autism spectrum disorders: a case-control study (2005) Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med, 159, pp. 151-157; Croen, L.A., Grether, J.K., Yoshida, C.K., Odouli, R., Hendrick, V., Antidepressant use during pregnancy and childhood autism spectrum disorders (2011) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 68, pp. 1104-1112; Dayan, C.M., Daniels, G.H., Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (1996) N Engl J Med, 335, pp. 99-107; Dupont, W.D., Power calculations for matched case-control studies (1988) Biometrics, 44, pp. 1157-1168; Erkkola, M., Karppinen, M., Järvelin, M.R., Knip, M., Virtanen, S.M., Folate, vitamin D, and iron intakes are low among pregnant Finnish women (1998) Eur J Clin Nutr, 52, pp. 742-748; Fombonne, E., Epidemiology of pervasive developmental disorders (2009) Pediatr Res, 65, pp. 591-598; Greenland, S., Rothman, K.J., Introduction to stratified analysis (1998) Modern epidemiology, pp. 253-279. , Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA, K.J.

TPH2) is coding for the key enzyme of serotonin (5-HT) synthesis in the brain and has been associated with a number of psychiatric conditions. A functional variation in the TPH2 gene (G-703T, rs4570625) has been found to affect anxiety-related personality; however, information is very limited regarding the five factor model (FFM) personality traits. We have examined the association of the TPH2 G-703T polymorphism with FFM personality traits, and the possible modulation by the functional variation in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) in a large longitudinal population representative sample.The FFM personality traits were assessed in both birth cohorts of the Estonian Children Personality Behaviour and Health Study at ages 15 (n. =. 742) and 18 (n. =. 834).Significant association of the TPH2 genotype with Neuroticism and Conscientiousness was found at age 15, and with Extraversion and Conscientiousness at age 18. Participants with the T/T genotype scored significantly lower on Neuroticism and higher on Conscientiousness and Extraversion scales. In addition, a gene. ×. gene interaction effect on Conscientiousness was revealed: the TPH2 genotype effect was evident only in the 5-HTTLPR S-allele carriers.These results provide further evidence on the possible role of genetic variations in 5-HT neurotransmission on development of personality traits, and suggest a functional interaction between two key proteins in the 5-HT-ergic system. © 2014 Elsevier Inc..","5-HTTLPR; Epistasis; Gene×gene interaction; Personality; TPH2 G-703T","Baehne, C.G., Ehlis, A.C., Plichta, M.M., Conzelmann, A., Pauli, P., Jacob, C., Tph2 gene variants modulate response control processes in adult ADHD patients and healthy individuals (2009) Mol Psychiatry, 14, pp. 1032-1039; Blonigen, D.M., Carlson, M.D., Hicks, B.M., Krueger, R.F., Iacono, W.G., Stability and change in personality traits from late adolescence to early adulthood: a longitudinal twin study (2008) J Pers, 76, pp. 229-266; Bouchard, T.J., Loehlin, J.C., Genes, evolution, and personality (2001) Behav Genet, 31, pp. 243-273; Brown, S.M., Peet, E., Manuck, S.B., Williamson, D.E., Dahl, R.E., Ferrell, R.E., A regulatory variant of the human tryptophan hydroxylase-2 gene biases amygdala reactivity (2005) Mol Psychiatry, 10, pp. 884-888; Canli, T., Lesch, K.P., Long story short: the serotonin transporter in emotion regulation and social cognition (2007) Nat Neurosci, 10, pp. 1103-1109; Canli, T., Congdon, E., Gutknecht, L., Constable, R.T., Lesch, K.P., Amygdala responsiveness is modulated by tryptophan hydroxylase-2 gene variation (2005) J Neural Transm, 112, pp. 1479-1485; Canli, T., Congdon, E., Constable, R.T., Lesch, K.P., Additive effects of serotonin transporter and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 gene variation on neural correlates of affective processing (2008) Biol Psychol, 79, pp. 118-125; Chen, G.-L., Vallender, E.J., Miller, G.M., Functional characterization of the human TPH2 5' regulatory region: untranslated region and polymorphisms modulate gene expression in vitro (2008) Hum Genet, 122, pp. 645-657; Clark, L.A., Watson, D., Mineka, S., Temperament, personality, and the mood and anxiety disorders (1994) J Abnorm Psychol, 103, pp. 103-116; Fava, M., Kendler, K.S., Major depressive disorder (2000) Neuron, 28, pp. 335-341; Gao, J., Pan, Z., Jiao, Z., Li, F., Zhao, G., Wei, Q., TPH2 gene polymorphisms and major depression - a meta-analysis (2012) PLoS One, 7, p. e36721; Gutknecht, L., Jacob, C., Strobel, A., Kriegebaum, C., Muller, J., Zeng, Y., Tryptophan hydroxylase-2 gene variation influences personality traits and disorders related to emotional dysregulation (2007) Int J Neuropsychopharmacol, 10, pp. 309-320; Hahn, T., Heinzel, S., Notebaert, K., Dresler, T., Reif, A., Lesch, K.-P., The tricks of the trait: neural implementation of personality varies with genotype-dependent serotonin levels (2013) Neuroimage, 81, pp. 393-399; Harro, J., Kiive, E., Droplets of black bile?

These observations suggest that excessive neural activity, as occurs during seizures, might influence developing neural circuitry with long-term outcomes that depend on age at the time of seizures. We systematically examined long-term structural and functional consequences of seizures induced in rats by kainic acid, pentylenetetrazol, and hyperthermia across postnatal ages from birth through postnatal day 90 in adulthood (P90). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and electrophysiological methods at ≥P95 following seizures induced from P1 to P90 demonstrated consistent patterns of gross atrophy, microstructural abnormalities in the corpus callosum (CC) and hippocampus, and functional alterations in hippocampal circuitry at ≥P95 that were independent of the method of seizure induction and varied systematically as a function of age at the time of seizures. Three distinct epochs were observed in which seizures resulted in distinct long-term structural and functional outcomes at ≥P95. Seizures prior to P20 resulted in DTI abnormalities in CC and hippocampus in the absence of gross cerebral atrophy, and increased paired-pulse inhibition (PPI) in the dentate gyrus (DG) at ≥P95. Seizures after P30 induced a different pattern of DTI abnormalities in the fimbria and hippocampus accompanied by gross cerebral atrophy with increases in lateral ventricular volume, as well as increased PPI in the DG at ≥P95. In contrast, seizures between P20 and P30 did not result in cerebral atrophy or significant imaging abnormalities in the hippocampus or white matter, but irreversibly decreased PPI in the DG compared to normal adult controls. These age-specific long-term structural and functional outcomes identify P20-30 as a potential critical period in hippocampal development defined by distinctive long-term structural and functional properties in adult hippocampal circuitry, including loss of capacity for seizure-induced plasticity in adulthood that could influence epileptogenesis and other hippocampal-dependent behaviors and functional properties. © 2014 IBRO.","Critical periods; Dentate gyrus; Developmental plasticity; Epilepsy; Hippocampus; In vivo imaging","Adamec, R.E., Sayin, U., Brown, A., The effects of corticotrophin releasing factor (Crf) and handling stress on behavior in the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety (1991) J Psychopharmacol (Oxford, England), 5, pp. 175-186; Baram, T.Z., Gerth, A., Schultz, L., Febrile seizures: an appropriate-aged model suitable for long-term studies (1997) Brain Res Dev Brain Res, 98, pp. 265-270; Bavelier, D., Neville, H.J., Cross-modal plasticity: where and how?

Home birth deliveries attended by others were excluded; only planned home births attended by midwives were included. Hospital deliveries attended by certified nurse midwives served as the reference. Perinatal risk factors were those established by ACOG and AAP.RESULTS: Midwife-attended planned home births in the United States had the following risk factors: breech presentation, 0.74% (odds ratio [OR], 3.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.87-3.56); prior cesarean delivery, 4.4% (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 2.0-2.17); twins, 0.64% (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.84-2.31); and gestational age 41 weeks or longer, 28.19% (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.68-1.74). All 4 perinatal risk factors were significantly higher among midwife-attended planned home births when compared with certified nurse midwives-attended hospital births, and 3 of 4 perinatal risk factors were significantly higher in planned home births attended by non-American Midwifery Certification Board (AMCB)-certified midwives (other midwives) when compared with home births attended by certified nurse midwives. Among midwife-attended planned home births, 65.7% of midwives did not meet the ACOG and AAP recommendations for certification by the American Midwifery Certification Board.CONCLUSION: At least 30% of midwife-attended planned home births are not low risk and not within clinical criteria set by ACOG and AAP, and 65.7% of planned home births in the United States are attended by non-AMCB certified midwives, even though both AAP and ACOG state that only AMCB-certified midwives should attend home births.

The purpose of this study is to access diagnostic value of NST during latent phase of labor by considering maternal and neonatal outcomes.SUBJECTS: This case study control study was performed on 450 healthy pregnant women with gestational age between 38-42 weeks in AL-Zahra teaching hospital in Tabriz, Iran. All participants underwent NST after being admitted to labor during their latent phase of delivery. Participants were divided into groups including the study group which included 150 participants with non-reactive NST results whereas 300 subjects with reactive NST results assigned in the control group. Subjects in both groups were hospitalized for pregnancy termination because of the delivery time. In order to find out the importance of routine performance of NST during delivery, the relationship between NST results and maternal and fetal outcomes was evaluated. Several criteria including type of delivery, meconium defecation, descent arrest, bradicardia, Apgar score, and still birth were compared between two types.RESULTS: Finding of this study showed that descent arrest occurred in 2.7% of the subjects in the study group, whereas it occurred in 4.7% of the participants in the control group (p=0.44). Bradicardia found in 28% of the participants in study group and 3.3% of the control group (p<0.001). The low Apgar Score was found in 2.7% of case group however; no the low apgar score detected in the control group. Meconium defecation observed in 11.3% of the subjects in the study group and 9.7% of the participants in control group (p=0.62). The amount of stillbirth were found in control group. There was a significant difference between the results of both groups in terms of bradicardia, descent arrest, and the low Apgar score and cesarean section.CONCLUSION: Results of this study revealed that participants in study group with nonreactive NST results had more fetal complications than those with reactive NST results.

Citizen science projects have been reported to be useful in policy development but there is little detail of how projects have contributed. The citizen science project, the Great Koala Count (GKC) collected ecological data about koalas and social data that have been used in the initial stages of the development of a South Australian Government koala management and conservation policy. After the GKC, we conducted an online survey of people who participated in the project and a control group. The survey focussed on opinions towards possible management options for koalas in South Australia. GKC participants were also asked about project-related changes in knowledge and opinions. We received 970 valid surveys and found some differences in opinions between GKC participants and the control group. Therefore, the GKC did not provide a representative sample of the entire South Australian population. However, we contend that the data from the citizen scientists are still valuable for policy development as it has been provided by people who are highly engaged in the topic (koala management in this case). It can be difficult to engage the public in the policy development process, and the citizen science project enabled the collection of a wide range of opinions, helping to discover and define relevant issues. Additionally, many people learnt about koalas and koala-related management issues, and some changed their opinions regarding koala management, also useful outcomes from the project in the policy development context. Our findings suggest that citizen science is useful for policy makers because projects provide the opportunity for dialogue with the people most interested in the topic of the project. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Citizen science; Community engagement; Koala; Policy; Public participation","Battersby, J.E., Greenwood, J.J.D., Monitoring terrestrial mammals in the UK: past, present and future, using lessons from the bird world (2004) Mammal Rev., 34, pp. 3-29; Bonney, R., Citizen science at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology (2007) Exemplary Science in Informal Education Settings: Standards-based Success Stories, , NSTA Press, Arlington, R.E.

We also tested the association between childhood cognition and later BP.Methods A population-based birth cohort derived from the Child Health and Development Study (CHDS) which included nearly all pregnant women receiving obstetric care from the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Plan, Northern California Region (KPNC) between 1959 and 1966. Prospectively obtained medical and offspring cognitive performance were used. Potential cases with BP from the cohort were identified by database linkages. This protocol identified 94 cases who were matched 1:8 to controls.Results Perinatal oxytocin was associated with a 2.4 times increased odds of later BP. Oxytocin was also associated with decreased performance on the Raven Matrices, but not on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT). Childhood cognition was not associated with later BP. Limitations Loss to follow-up must be considered in all birth cohort studies. In addition, the childhood cognitive battery did not include tests related to multiple domains of cognition which have been associated with later BP. A third limitation is the modest sample size of those exposed to oxytocin.Conclusions This study provides evidence for a potentially important perinatal risk factor for BP and cognitive impairment in childhood. While the association between perinatal oxytocin and offspring BP must be viewed cautiously until further studies can attempt to replicate the result, it lends support to the broader view that neurodevelopmental factors contribute to BP. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We explored neural activation to a visuospatial working memory (VSWM) versus a control task using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in adolescents with PDE and a community comparison group (CC) of non-exposed adolescents. We applied graph theory metrics to resting state data using a network of nodes derived from the VSWM task activation map to further explore connectivity underlying WM functioning. Participants (ages 12-15. years) included 47 adolescents (27 PDE and 20 CC). All analyses controlled for potentially confounding differences in birth characteristics and postnatal environment. Significant group by task differences in brain activation emerged in the left middle frontal gyrus (BA 6) with the CC group, but not the PDE group, activating this region during VSWM. The PDE group deactivated the culmen, whereas the CC group activated it during the VSWM task. The CC group demonstrated a significant relation between reaction time and culmen activation, not present in the PDE group. The network analysis underlying VSWM performance showed that PDE group had lower global efficiency than the CC group and a trend level reduction in local efficiency. The network node corresponding to the BA 6 group by task interaction showed reduced nodal efficiency and fewer direct connections to other nodes in the network. These results suggest that adolescence reveals altered neural functioning related to response planning that may reflect less efficient network functioning in youth with PDE. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Adolescence;

Methods: This comparative cohort study was conducted from 1st October 2010 to 30 September 2012. Total 200 gravid women 100 were overweight and 100 normal weight pregnant women with gestational age for 08-40 weeks were included. Women having BMI (25–29.9 Kg/m2) were measured overweight and included in group A and 100 women having normal BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 as controls were in-group B. Chi-square test was applied to compare the proportion of maternal and fetal outcomes. Significant P–value of &lt; 0.05 was considered. Results: The age range was between 30 to 45 years with mean age of 30±4.1 years in both groups. Overweight pregnant women had significantly high frequency of pre-eclampsia (27% versus 9% in controls), PIH (24% versus 8% in controls), gestational diabetes mellitus (22% versus 5% in controls), prolonged labour (4% versus 6% in controls), Caesarean section (44% versus 16% in controls), Wound infection (3% versus 2% in controls) and Postpartum Hemorrhage (5% versus 2% in controls). P-value &lt; 0.001 was considered significance. Fetal complications in overweight pregnant women compared to controls i.e. Still birth (13% versus 2%), Early neonatal death (11% versus 1%), shoulder dystocia (5% versus 1%) and NICU admission (47% versus 10%). Results were statistically significant except shoulder dystocia. Conclusion: We conclude that the result of present study indicates obesity exerts deleterious effect, both on fetal and maternal outcome. © 2015, Professional Medical Publications.

","Kaplanoglu, M., Adiyaman Universiry. ; Kaplanoglu, D., Adiyaman Universiry. ; Usman, M.G., Adiyaman Universiry. ","AIM: We aimed to evaluate the postpartum contraception preferences of adolescent women in this study.MATERIALS & METHOD: This descriptive study was prepared after a retrospective analysis of file records of primigravida women who had given birth at the Adiyaman University School of Medicine Training and Research Hospital Department of Obstetric and Gynecology between January 2010 and June 2012. More than 12 months had passed after birth. The adolescents who were included in the study and the control group women were called by phone and invited to our clinic. A total of 506 adolescents and 1,046 control group women came to the clinic and were evaluated. The control group was formed of women between the age of 20-35 years who gave given birth in our clinic during the same period and were randomly selected. Postpartum obstetric history, contraception methods and data of these patients were recorded.RESULTS: The mean age was 18.3±0.4 years and 28.2±4.9 years in the adolescent group and control group respectively. No contraception other than lactation amenorrhea was used by 256 women of the adolescent group (50.6%) and 345 women of the control group (33%). The most commonly used contraceptive method in both groups other than lactation amenorrhea was condoms (160 women (64%) and 230 women (32.8%) respectively). The annual contraceptive failure rate was 3.95% in the adolescent group and 1.72% in the control group. The highest failure rate was with lactation amenorrhea in both groups.DISCUSSION: Adolescent women mostly use contraceptive methods with low reliability such as lactation amenorrhea and the calendar method in the postpartum period. Providing adequate contraceptive education is therefore important. On the other hand, starting such training starting in the early postnatal period will prevent recurring adolescent pregnancies with a short pregnancy interval.",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928283780

Ambedkar University, Khandari CampusAgra, India","In India pre-term birth is the leading cause of death of infants and this number is continuously increasing. Pre-term birth is an increasingly prevalent complex condition with multiple risk factors. Very few studies have focused on the effect of oxidative stress due to organochlorine pesticides in pre-term deliveries. The aim of this study was to analyze the organochlorine pesticide residues in the placenta of females with pre-term and full-term deliveries and assess the levels of glutathione and malondialdehyde as oxidative stress markers and to correlate them with organochlorine pesticide levels. Fifty cases of full-term deliveries and forty cases of pre-term deliveries were included in this case-control study. The residues of organochlorine pesticides, such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites i.e., (p,p-DDE, p,p-DDT, o,p-DDD) and isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) (α, β, γ and δ), were analyzed by a gas chromatography instrument equipped with an electron capture detector. Oxidative stress was measured by the quantification of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH). In placental tissue from the pre-term delivery, significantly higher levels of α-HCH, total HCH, p,p-DDE and total DDT were recorded than in the placental tissue from the full-term delivery. The MDA level was significantly elevated, while GSH level was significantly lowered in the placental tissue of women with pre-term delivery compared to women with the full-term delivery. There were significant positive correlations of placental pesticide (α-HCH, γ-HCH & total HCH) levels with MDA (p < 0.05), suggesting that pre-term delivery are pesticide-induced. In conclusion, organochlorine pesticide residues are associated with oxidative stress and we cannot rule out the possibility of the role of organochlorine pesticides in pre-term deliveries.

To test the hypothesis that preterm birth alters cortical organization during the late second and third trimesters of gestation, we interrogated cerebral lateralization at rest in 26 very preterm subjects (birth weight 500-1500. g) with no evidence of brain injury and 25 healthy term control subjects at term equivalent age. Employing an unbiased voxel-based measure of functional connectivity, these data demonstrated that cerebral lateralization is impaired in the prematurely-born. At term equivalent age, preterm neonates showed significantly less lateralization in regions subserving both receptive and expressive language, left Brodmann (BA) areas insula-BA22-BA21 and L BA45-BA47 (. p<. 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons for both). Exploratory region of interest analyses demonstrated significantly less inter-hemispheric connectivity from L BA22 to R BA22 in preterm infants compared to term controls (. p<. 0.005) and from R BA22 to its homolog (. p<. 0.005). L BA22, Wernicke's area, was more strongly connected to R BA39, foreshadowing neural networks for language in preterm subjects at school age, adolescence and young adulthood. For these very preterm neonates born at less than 30. weeks' PMA, the degree of prematurity had no influence on lateralization in these differential regions. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Cerebral lateralization; Functional MRI; Intrinsic connectivity distribution; Language development; Preterm infant brain; Resting-state functional connectivity","Anderson, A.L., Thomason, M.E., Functional plasticity before the cradle: a review of neural functional imaging in the human fetus (2013) Neurosci.

Transfusion can be accomplished by either delayed cord clamping or cord stripping. Both are equally effective in previous randomized trials. We hypothesized that combining these 2 techniques would further improve outcomes in preterm neonates.STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective randomized trial for singleton deliveries with estimated gestational ages between 22 and 31 6/7 weeks. The control protocol required a 30-second delayed cord clamping, whereas the test protocol instructed a concurrent cord stripping during the delay. The primary outcome was initial fetal hematocrit. We also examined secondary outcomes of neonatal mortality, length of time on the ventilator, days to discharge, peak bilirubin, number of phototherapy days, and neonatal complication rates.RESULTS: Of the 67 patients analyzed, 32 were randomized to the control arm and 35 were randomized to the test arm. The gestational ages and fetal weights were similar between the arms. Mean hematocrit of the control arm was 47.75%, and the mean hematocrit for the test arm was 47.71% (P = .98). These results were stratified by gestational age, revealing the infants less than 28 weeks had an average hematocrit of 41.2% in the control arm and 44.7% in the test arm (P = .12). In the infants with gestational ages of 28 weeks or longer, the control arm had an average hematocrit of 52.9%, which was higher than the test arm, which averaged 49.5% (P = .04). The control arm received an average of 1.53 blood transfusions, whereas the test arm received 0.97 (P = .33). The control arm had 3 neonatal deaths, and the test arm had none (P = .10). The average number of days until discharge was 71.2 for the control arm and 67.8 for the test arm (P = .66). The average number of days on the ventilator was 4.86 for the control arm and 3.06 for the test arm (P = .34).CONCLUSION: Adding cord stripping to the delayed cord clamp does not result in an increased hematocrit.

These recommendations are based on small case series of both term and preterm infants, where death or abnormal outcome was nearly universal. Study objective was to determine recent outcome of infants with an Apgar score of 0 at 10 min despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation, treated with therapeutic hypothermia or standard treatment, in randomised cooling studies. Design: Outcome studies of infants with an Apgar of 0 at 10 min subsequently resuscitated and treated with hypothermia or standard treatment were reviewed and combined with local outcome data of infants treated with hypothermia. Results: Four recent studies (n=81) and local data (n=9) yielded a total of 90 infants with an Apgar of 0 at 10 min, with 56 treated with hypothermia and 34 controls. Primary outcome of death or abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome (18-24 months) occurred in 73% cooled and 79.5% normothermic infants (p=0.61). Implications: Although poor, the outcome for infants with an Apgar of 0 at 10 min of life has improved substantially in recent years. This may be related to treatment with hypothermia, enhanced resuscitation techniques and/or other supportive management. Current recommendations to consider discontinuation of resuscitation without a detectable heart rate at 10 min should consider these findings.",,"Martin, R.J., Fanaroff, A.A., Walsh, M.C., (2011) Neonatal-perinatal Medicine: Diseases of the Fetus and Infant, , 9th edn: Elsevier; Casalaz, D.M., Marlow, N., Speidel, B.D., Outcome of resuscitation following unexpected apparent stillbirth (1998) Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed, 78, pp. F112-F115; Harrington, D.J., Redman, C.W., Moulden, M., The long-term outcome in surviving infants with Apgar zero at 10 minutes: A systematic review of the literature and hospital-based cohort (2007) Am J Obstet Gynecol, 196, pp. 463e1-463e5; Niermeyer, S., Kattwinkel, J., Van Reempts, P., International guidelines for neonatal resuscitation: An excerpt from the guidelines 2000 for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care: International consensus on science.

However, an increasing number of proteins containing CCP domains have been reported to display neuronal functions. Susd2 is a transmembrane protein containing one CCP domain. It was previously identified as a tumor-reversing protein, but has no characterized function in the CNS. The present study investigates the expression and function of Susd2 in the rat hippocampus. Characterization of Susd2 during development showed a peak in mRNA expression two weeks after birth. In hippocampal neuronal cultures, the same expression profile was observed at 15. days in vitro for both mRNA and protein, a time consistent with synaptogenesis in our model. At the subcellular level, Susd2 was located on the soma, axons and dendrites, and appeared to associate preferentially with excitatory synapses. Inhibition of Susd2 by shRNAs led to decreased numbers of excitatory synaptic profiles, exclusively. Also, morphological parameters were studied on young (5DIV) developing neurons. After Susd2 inhibition, an increase in dendritic tree length but a decrease in axon elongation were observed, suggesting changes in adhesion properties. Our results demonstrate a dual role for Susd2 at different developmental stages, and raise the question whether Susd2 and other CCP-containing proteins expressed in the CNS could be function-related. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Adhesion molecule cleavage; Axon elongation; CCP domain; Dendritic outgrowth; Sushi; Synapse regulation","Arimura, N., Kaibuchi, K., Neuronal polarity: from extracellular signals to intracellular mechanisms (2007) Nat.

We examine whether material hardship is associated with one indicator of such investments: participation in a tax-advantaged college savings plan (529 plan). Data for this study come from the SEED for Oklahoma Kids (SEED OK) experiment, an intervention that offers Child Development Accounts with financial incentives to encourage the accumulation of college savings for children from the time of their birth. Results show that material hardship is negatively associated with 529-plan participation, and this association varies by treatment status. At all levels of material hardship, treatment-group mothers are more likely to hold accounts than control-group mothers.

It is unclear as to what extent each of these processes independently contributes to poor outcome. Furthermore, it is unclear whether there is an interaction between the two processes - does seizure activity cause additional brain damage beyond that produced by ischemia and/or does brain damage foster seizures?The model of focal cerebral ischemia induced by the intrahippocampal infusion of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in 12-day-old rat was used to examine the role of the endothelin receptors in the development of focal ischemia, symptomatic acute seizures and neurodegeneration. ET-1 (40pmol/μl) was infused either alone or co-administered with selective antagonists of ETA (BQ123; 70nmol/μl) or ETB receptors (BQ788; 70nmol/1μl). Effects of activation of ETB receptors were studied using selective agonist 4-Ala-ET-1 (40pmol/1μl).Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and tissue oxygenation (pO2) were measured in anesthetized animals with a Doppler-flowmeter and a pO2-sensor, respectively. Seizure development was assessed with video-EEG in freely moving rats. Controls received the corresponding volume of the appropriate vehicle (10mM PBS or 0.01% DMSO-PBS solution; pH7.4). The extent of hippocampal lesion was determined using FluoroJade B staining performed 24h after ET-1 infusion.Infusion of ET-1 or ET-1+ETB receptor antagonist reduced rCBF to ~25% and pO2 to ~10% for about 1.5h, whereas selective ETB agonist, ET-1+ETA antagonist and the PBS vehicle had only negligible effect on the rCBF and pO2 levels. Reduction of rCBF was associated with the development of lesion in the injected hippocampus.In all groups, except sham operated and PBS controls, epileptiform activity was observed after activation of the ETA or the ETB receptors. The data revealed a positive correlation between the severity of morphological damage and all the measured seizure parameters (seizure frequency, average and total seizure duration) in the ET-1 group. In addition, the severity of morphological damage positively correlated with the average seizure duration in animals after infusion of ET-1+ETA receptor antagonist or after infusion of ET-1+ETB receptor antagonist.Our results indicate that the activation of ETA receptors is crucial for ischemia development, however either ETA or ETB receptors mediate the development of seizures following the application of ET-1 in immature rats. The dissociation between the ischemic-producing and seizure-producing processes suggests that damage is not necessary to induce seizures, although it may exacerbate them. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Cerebral blood flow; Endothelin-1; ET receptors; Focal ischemia; Hippocampus; Immature rat; Oxygen saturation; Seizures","Baba, A., Role of endothelin B receptor signals in reactive astrocytes (1998) Life Sci., 62, pp. 1711-1715; Bogaert, L., Scheller, D., Moonen, J., Sarre, S., Smolders, I., Ebinger, G., Michotte, Y., Neurochemical changes and laser Doppler flowmetry in the endothelin-1 rat model for focal cerebral ischemia (2000) Brain Res., 887, pp. 266-275; Cataltepe, O., Vannucci, R.C., Heitjan, D.F., Towfighi, J., Effect of status epilepticus on hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in the immature rat (1995) Pediatr.

Addressing the dearth of pregnancy smoking interventions with partner support, PRISM (Prevent Relapse In SMoking) is a partnership between a research institution and the two largest state-owned obstetrics and gynecology clinics in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The study will assess the efficacy of a couple-focused telephone-counseling program to prevent smoking relapse among mothers who quit smoking closely before or during pregnancy. Methods/design: The intervention is a program for couples based on motivational interviewing delivered over the phone after birth. The study is an ongoing randomized controlled trial of 250 Romanian women recruited soon after childbirth, who quit smoking in the six months before pregnancy or no later than the end of the first pregnancy trimester and remained abstinent (which was biochemically verified) until delivery. Participants were randomized to: (1) a control arm (usual care); and (2) an intervention arm consisting of up to 4 postnatal counseling calls for mothers and their partners using motivational interviewing to encourage the woman to remain smoke-free and the partner to support her decision. The primary outcome is maternal smoking abstinence at 6. months postpartum (biochemically verified). Discussion: PRISM has the potential to identify strategies to reduce maternal postnatal relapse and increase partner quitting. If successful, the program may be an effective method to prevent and reduce smoking, which may lead to improved child, mother, and partner health both in the short and the long term. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Couples' intervention; Motivational interviewing; Postnatal smoking relapse; Pregnancy smoking; Romania","Goedhart, G., Van Eijsden, M., Van der Wal, M., Bonsel, G., Ethnic differences in preterm birth and its subtypes: the effect of a cumulative risk profile (2008) BJOG, 155 (6), pp. 710-719; Voigt, M., Hermanaussen, M., Wittwer-Backifen, U., Fusch, C., Hesse, V., Sex-specific differences in birth weight due to maternal smoking during pregnancy (2006) Eur J Pediatr, 165 (11), pp. 757-761; Ventura, S., Hamilton, B., Mathews, T., Chandra, A., Trends and variations in smoking during pregnancy and low birth weight; evidence from the birth certificate. 1990-2000 (2003) Pediatrics, 111 (5), pp. 1176-1180; Empower Women: Combating Tobacco Industry Marketing in the WHO European Region, , www.euro.who.int,http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0014/128120/e93852.pdf, Retrieved November 7, 2014, from; Meghea, C.I., Rus, D., Rus, I.A., Holtrop, J.S., Roman, L., Smoking during pregnancy and associated risk factors in a sample of Romanian women (2012) Eur J Public Health, 22 (2), pp. 229-233; Krsterv, S., Marinkovic, J., Simic, S., Nikola, K., Bondy, S., Prevalence and predictors of smoking and quitting during pregnancy in Serbia: results of a nationally representative survey (2011) Int J Public Health, 57 (6), pp. 875-883; Polanska, K., Hanke, W., Sobala, W., Lowe, J.B., Jaakkola, J.J., Predictors of smoking relapse after delivery: prospective study in central Poland (2011) Matern Child Health J, 15 (5), pp. 579-586; Melen, E., Wickman, M., Nordvall, S., Influence of early and current environmental exposure factors on sensitization and outcome of asthma in pre-school children (2001) Allergy, 56 (7), pp. 646-652; Wisborg, K., Kesmodel, U., Henriksen, T., A prospective study of smoking during pregnancy and SIDS (2000) Arch Dis Child, 83 (3), pp. 203-206; Eskenazi, B., Castorina, R., Association of prenatal maternal or postnatal child environmental tobacco smokes exposure and neurodevelopmental and behavioral problems in children (1999) Environ Health Perspect, 107 (12), pp. 991-1000; Mucci, L., Granath, F., Cnattingius, S., Maternal smoking and childhood leukemia and lymphoma risk among 1,440,542 Swedish children (2004) Cancer Epidem Biomark, 13 (9), pp. 1528-1533; Global Adult Tobacco Survey.

This pumping mechanism is inspired by microscale internal flow motions within insect tracheal networks, which is observed to be induced by localized rhythmic wall contractions.Results: The derived flow velocity stream function suggests that, there exist contraction-induced stagnation planes “Ghost-Valves” in the neighbourhoods of channel collapsing sites. The dynamics (locations, birth/death) of these ghost valves have shown to be strong function of the assigned wall motion protocol, which can be tuned to control flow transport along the axial direction and produce unidirectional net flow.Conclusions: An inelastic microchannel subjected to a zero pressure drop and undergoes localized rhythmic wall contractions can work as a micropump. The minimum requirement for this paradigm to produce a unidirectional net flow is; A channel with at least two contracting membranes that move with a distinct time-lag with respect each other. The presented ghost-valve pumping model is expected to function efficiently in the low Reynolds number flow regime. Therefore, it yields a potential usefulness in many of biomedical microdevices for drug delivery, point-of-care testing, and cardiac assistance devices. © 2015, Korean Society of Medical and Biological Engineering and Springer.","Bioinspiration; Ghost-Valve; Low Reynolds number; Medical devices; Micropumping","Chu, A.K.H., Transport control within a microtube (2004) Phys Rev E; Aboelkassem, Y., Staples, A.E., Flow transport in a microchannel induced by moving wall contractions: a novel micropumping mechanism (2012) Acta Mech, 223 (3), pp. 463-480; Aboelkassem, Y., Staples, A.E., Stokeslets-meshfree computations and theory for flow in a collapsible microchannel (2013) Theor Comp Fluid Dyn, 27 (5), pp. 681-700; Aboelkassem, Y., Staples, A.E., Selective pumping in a network: insect-style microscale flow transport (2013) Bioinspir Biomim; Aboelkassem, Y., Staples, A.E., A bioinspired pumping model for flow in a microtube with rhythmic wall contractions (2013) J Fluids Struct, 42, pp. 187-204; Aboelkassem, Y., Staples, A.E., A three-dimensional model for flow pumping in a microchannel inspired by insect respiration (2014) Acta Mech, 225 (2), pp. 493-507; Unger, M.A., Chou, H.-P., Thorsen, T., Scherer, A., Quake, S.R., Monolithic microfabricated valves and pumps by multilayer soft lithography (2000) Science, 288 (5463), pp. 113-116; Pandolfi, A., Ortiz, M., Improved design of low-pressure fluidic microvalves (2007) J Micromech Microeng, 17 (8), pp. 1487-1493; Thorsen, T., Maerkl, S.J., Quake, S.R., Microfluidic large-scale integration (2002) Science, 298 (5593), pp. 580-584; Melin, J., Quake, S.R., Microfluidic large-scale integration: the evolution of design rules for biological automation (2007) Annu Rev Bioph Biom, 36, pp. 213-231; Liebau, G., Über ein ventilloses pumpprinzip (1954) Naturwissenschaften, 41 (14), p. 327; Liebau, G., Die stromungsprinzipien des herzens (1955) Z Kreislaufforsch, 44, pp. 677-684; Rinderknecht, D., Hickerson, A.I., Gharib, M., A valveless microimpedance pump driven by electromagnetic actuation (2005) J Micromech Microeng, 15 (4), pp. 861-866; Oh, K.W., Rong, R., Aha, C.H., Miniaturization of pinch-type valves and pumps for practical micro total analysis system integration (2005) J Micromech Microeng, 15 (12), pp. 2449-2455; Iverson, B.D., Garimella, S.V., Recent advances in microscale pumping technologies: a review and evaluation (2008) Microfluid Nanofluid, 5 (2), pp. 145-174; Laser, D.J., Santiago, J.G., A review of micropumps (2004) J Micromech Microeng, 14 (6), pp. 35-64; Li, M., Brasseur, J.G., Non-steady peristaltic transport in finitelength tubes (1993) J Fluid Mech, 248, pp. 129-151; Secomb, T.W., Flow in a channel with pulsating walls (1978) J Fluid Mech, 88, pp. 273-288; Skalak, F.M., Wang, C.Y., On the unsteady squeezing of a viscous fluid from a tube (1979) J Aust Math Soc B, 21 (1), pp. 65-74; Wang, C.Y., Arbitrary squeezing of fluid from a tube at low squeeze numbers (1980) Z Angew Math Phys, 31 (5), pp. 620-627; Singh, P., Radhakrishnan, V., Narayan, K.A., Squeezing flow between parallel plates (1990) Ing Arch, 60 (4), pp. 274-281",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928118446

HPP causes mineralization disorders including soft bones (rickets or osteomalacia) and defects in teeth and periodontal tissues. Enzyme replacement therapy using mineral-targeting recombinant TNAP has proven effective in preventing skeletal and dental defects in TNAP knockout (Alpl-/-) mice, a model for life-threatening HPP. Here, we show that the administration of a soluble, intestinal-like chimeric alkaline phosphatase (ChimAP) improves the manifestations of HPP in Alpl-/- mice. Mice received daily subcutaneous injections of ChimAP at doses of 1, 8 or 16mg/kg, from birth for up to 53days. Lifespan and body weight of Alpl-/- mice were normalized, and vitamin B6-associated seizures were absent with 16mg/kg/day of ChimAP. Radiographs, μCT and histological analyses documented improved mineralization in cortical and trabecular bone and secondary ossification centers in long bones of ChimAP16-treated mice. There was no evidence of craniosynostosis in the ChimAP16-treated mice and we did not detect ectopic calcification by radiography and histology in the aortas, stomachs, kidneys or lungs in any of the treatment groups. Molar tooth development and function improved with the highest ChimAP dose, including enamel, dentin, and tooth morphology. Cementum remained deficient and alveolar bone mineralization was reduced compared to controls, though ChimAP-treated Alpl-/- mice featured periodontal attachment and retained teeth. This study provides the first evidence for the pharmacological efficacy of ChimAP for use in the treatment of skeletal and dental manifestations of HPP. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Craniosynostosis; Enzyme replacement;

Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) was designed to minimize these by facilitating the emotional connection between mother and infant, beginning early in the infant’s neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay. We examined depression and anxiety symptoms of mothers of preterm infants at 4 months infant corrected age (CA). One hundred fifteen mothers who delivered between 26 and 34 weeks gestational age were randomized to receive standard care (SC) or standard care plus FNI. Mothers’ self-reported depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale: CES-D) and state anxiety (Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory: STAI) symptoms were assessed at enrollment, near to term age, and 4 months (CA). At 4 months CA, mean CES-D and STAI scores were significantly lower in FNI mothers compared to SC mothers. Effectiveness of FNI can only be evaluated as an integrated intervention strategy as it was not possible to control all aspects of FNI activities. Although there was considerable loss to follow-up, analyses suggest that resulting biases could have masked rather than inflated the measured effect size for depressive symptoms. FNI may be a feasible and practicable way to diminish the impact of premature delivery on maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Wien","Anxiety; Depression; NICU; Nurture; Preterm birth",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923774114

The hypothesis is tested that neonatal exposure to hyperoxia is associated with long term up regulation of cough. Airway hyperresponsiveness is also investigated because it is a frequent finding in children born preterm and may be linked to cough.Thirty nine young rabbits survived a 48. h neonatal exposure to 93% oxygen (H, n=. 26) or continued room air (A, n=. 13). Cough response to mechanical tracheal stimulation and airway responses to a mock exercise and to methacholine were studied under anaesthesia.Larger incidence of coughs and increased sensitivity to tracheal stimulation occurred in H vs A (. p<. 0.01), while bronchial responses to exercise or methacholine were similar in both groups.Neonatal hyperoxia is associated with up regulation of cough in young rabbits. The lack of a parallel increase in airway responsiveness suggests up regulation may be of central origin. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cough; Direct airway responsiveness; Hyperoxia; Indirect airway responsiveness; Newborn","Agani, F.H., Kuo, N.T., Chang, C.H., Dreshaj, I.A., Farver, C.F., Krause, J.E., Ernsberger, P., Martin, R.J., Effect of hyperoxia on substance P expression and airway reactivity in the developing lung (1997) Am.

Immunological changes during pregnancy make the activation of latent TB infection or de novo infection more likely than among non-pregnant women. TB treatment in pregnancy poses several problems that have been under-researched, such as contraindications to anti-TB and anti-HIV drugs and potential risks to the neonate, which are particularly important with respect to second-line TB treatment. Whilst congenital TB is thought to be rare, data from high HIV burden settings suggest this is not the case. There is a need for more studies screening for TB in neonates and observing outcomes, and testing preventative or curative actions. National tuberculosis control programmes (NTPs) should work with antenatal and national HIV programmes in high-burden populations to provide screening at antenatal clinics, or to establish functioning systems whereby pregnant women at high risk can drop in to routine NTP screening stations. © 2014 The Authors.","HIV; MDR-TB; Pregnancy; Pregnant; TB; Tuberculosis","Stewart, D.A., Pregnancy and tuberculosis: Part 2-The treatment of tuberculosis complicated by pregnancy (1922) Can Med Assoc J, 12, pp. 103-106; Stewart, D.A., Pregnancy and tuberculosis: Part I-The effects of pregnancy on tuberculosis (1922) Can Med Assoc J, 12, pp. 1-3; Gupta, S., Granich, R., Suthar, A.B., Smyth, C., Baggaley, R., Sculier, D., Global policy review of antiretroviral therapy eligibility criteria for treatment and prevention of HIV and tuberculosis in adults, pregnant women, and serodiscordant couples (2013) J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 62, pp. e87-e97; (2014) Global tuberculosis report 2014 (in IRIS), , World Health Organization, Geneva; Mathad, J.S., Gupta, A., Tuberculosis in pregnant and postpartum women: epidemiology, management, and research gaps (2012) Clin Infect Dis, 55, pp. 1532-1549; Hoffmann, C.J., Variava, E., Rakgokong, M., Masonoke, K., van der Watt, M., Chaisson, R.E., Martinson, N.A., High prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis but low sensitivity of symptom screening among HIV-infected pregnant women in South Africa (2013) PLoS One, 8; Sugarman, J., Colvin, C., Moran, A., Oxlade, O., Tuberculosis in pregnancy: an estimate of the global burden of disease.

An epidemiological study has linked vitamin D deficiency to adverse perinatal outcomes, which include decreased birth weight. The placenta as an important source of vitamin D regulates its metabolism through the vitamin D receptor (VDR), but the mechanism by which VDR regulates trophoblast function is poorly understood. Our study aimed at determining placental VDR expression in FGR and gestation-matched control (GMC) pregnancies and identifying the actions of VDR in trophoblast differentiation and apoptosis. Placentae were collected from a well-defined cohort of idiopathic FGR and GMC pregnancies. VDR mRNA and protein expressions were determined by PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting, while functional consequences of VDR inactivation in vitro were determined on BeWo cells by determining changes in differentiation, attachment and apoptosis. Significant decreases in VDR mRNA expression (p = 0.0005) and protein expression (p = 0.0003) were observed in the FGR samples, while VDR inactivation, which showed markers for differentiation, cell attachment and apoptosis, was significantly increased. Thus, decreased placental VDR may contribute to uncontrolled premature differentiation and apoptosis of trophoblasts that are characteristics of idiopathic FGR pregnancies.Key message: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) affects up to 5 % of all pregnancies worldwide.FGR is the second highest cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity.The placenta plays a pivotal role in vitamin D metabolism during pregnancy.Vitamin D deficiency is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.Placental vitamin D receptor expression is decreased in FGR. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Differentiation; Fetal growth restriction; Placenta; Trophoblast; Vitamin D",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923600496

We, therefore, designed a retrospective cohort trial of ZP dysmorphology to assess the clinical significance of ZP dysmorphology and its affect on IVF outcome. Over the same time period a random sample of 77 cycles of 77 subjects with all normal oocyte morphology were selected as controls. Methods: Between July 2006 and December 2010, all fresh non-donor cases performed at a university hospital IVF center were assessed for ZP dysmorphology. ZP dysmorphology included extracytoplasmic abnormalities (dark ZP and large perivitelline space) and oocyte shape (oval or irregularly shaped ZP). 136 IVF cycles from 119 subjects were identified where a majority of oocytes displayed ZP dysmorphology. Over the same time period a random sample of 77 cycles of 77 subjects with all normal oocyte morphology were selected as controls. IVF prognostic and outcome parameters were compared between the patients with dysmorphic and normal oocytes. Results: 136/1710 (8.0%) cycles of fresh non-donor IVF displayed predominant ZP dysmorphology. Dysmorphic and normal oocytes showed no difference in the oocyte quality predictors such as FSH (6.03+/-2.5 vs. 6.8+/-2.3 IU/L), or AMH (2.5+/-2.0 vs. 2.30+/-1.5 ng/ml levels). ZP dysmorphology was associated with markedly diminished clinical pregnancy rates (44% vs. 70%; RR:0.62 [0.48, 0.80]; p = 0.0002), implantation rates (.17 vs. .36; IRR: 0.48 [0.34, 0.68]; p < 0.0001) and live birth rates as compared to non dysmorphic oocytes (29% vs. 52%; RR:0.55 [0.39, 0.79]; p = 0.001). Conclusions: ZP dysmorphology is associated with markedly diminished pregnancy and implantation rates in IVF. The poorer outcome appears to be independent of the usual markers of ovarian reserve. © 2015 Sauerbrun-Cutler et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","In-vitro fertilization; Infertility; Oocyte; Zona Pellucida",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928742782

The aims of this study were to ascertain the coverage of HIV testing during prenatal care and estimate the prevalence of HIV infection during pregnancy in Brazil. Methods: This was a national hospital-based study of 23,894 women that was conducted in 2011-2012. The data came from interviews with mothers during postpartum hospitalization, from hospital medical files and from prenatal cards. All the pregnant women with reactive serological results for HIV infection marked on their cards or with diagnoses of HIV infection during the hospital stay for delivery were considered cases of HIV infection. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were performed to investigate factors associated with the prevalence of HIV infection and with performing at least one HIV test during pregnancy. Results: Among participating women, the coverage of testing for HIV infection was 81.7% among those who presented with prenatal card and the prevalence of HIV infection among pregnant women was 0.4% (95% CI: 0.32-0.51%). In the adjusted analysis, there was higher coverage of testing among women living in the South and Southeast regions; of women aged 35 years and over; with greater schooling levels; who self-reported as white; with prenatal care provided in private services; with an early start to prenatal care; and with an adequate number of consultations, defined as a minimum of six for a term pregnancy. In the adjusted analyses there was a greater odds ratio of HIV infection among women living in the South region, aged 35 years and over, with schooling of less than 8 years, who self-reported race as black, without a partner, with syphilis coinfection and who were attended by public services. Conclusions: The prevalence of HIV infection among pregnant women in Brazil remains below 1% and the coverage of testing for HIV infection is over 80%. However, the regional and social inequalities in access to healthcare services and the missed opportunities for diagnoses of HIV infection indicate the importance of strengthening HIV infection control programs during pregnancy. © Domingues et al.","Brazil; HIV seroprevalence; Pregnancy; Prenatal care; Serological testing; Vertical transmission of infectious disease","Rongkavilit, C., Asmar, B.I., Advances in prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission: the international perspectives (2011) Indian J Pediatr, 78, pp. 192-204; (2011), http://www.unaids.org.br/biblioteca/biblioteca.asp, Programa Conjunto das Nações Unidas sobre HIV/AIDS/VIH/SIDA.

Overall, 126 cases and 126 controls were included.Results: Only 33 % of malnourished children (cases) were exclusively breast fed. Among controls, 71 % were exclusively breast fed for the first 6 mo after birth. Most cases had associated infections (p 0.004) and anemia (p &lt; 0.001). ROC curve revealed 120 mm mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) as the best cut off for predicting SAM. Mothers’ education, pre-lacteal feeds and co-morbidities were independent predictors of malnutrition (R2 = 22.1 %) by logistic regression.Conclusions: Though 11.5 cm MUAC has been mentioned by WHO as the cut off for identifying SAM, a higher cut off (12 cm) may be required to use it as a screening tool. Mothers’ education, pre-lacteal feeds and co-morbidities were found to be independent determinants for malnutrition in the present patient population, indicating the need towards a targeted approach for modifying these factors. © 2015 Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation","Co-morbidities; Mid-upper arm circumference; Moderate acute malnutrition; Severe acute malnutrition",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923382550

High VT ventilation of preterm lambs produces cerebral white matter (WM) pathology similar to that observed in preterm infants who develop cerebral palsy. We hypothesized that human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs), which have anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties, would reduce ventilation-induced WM pathology in neonatal late preterm lamb brains. Methods: Two groups of lambs (0.85 gestation) were used, as follows: (1) ventilated lambs (Vent; n = 8) were ventilated using a protocol that induces injury (VT targeting 15 ml/kg for 15 min, with no positive end-expiratory pressure) and were then maintained for another 105 min, and (2) ventilated + hAECs lambs (Vent+hAECs; n = 7) were similarly ventilated but received intravenous and intratracheal administration of 9 × 107 hAECs (18 × 107 hAECs total) at birth. Oxygenation and ventilation parameters were monitored in real time; cerebral oxygenation was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. qPCR (quantitative real-time PCR) and immunohistochemistry were used to assess inflammation, vascular leakage and astrogliosis in both the periventricular and subcortical WM of the frontal and parietal lobes. An unventilated control group (UVC; n = 5) was also used for qPCR analysis of gene expression. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare physiological data. Student's t test and one-way ANOVA were used for immunohistological and qPCR data comparisons, respectively. Results: Respiratory parameters were not different between groups. Interleukin (IL)-6 mRNA levels in subcortical WM were lower in the Vent+hAECs group than the Vent group (p = 0.028). IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA levels in periventricular WM were higher in the Vent+hAECs group than the Vent group (p = 0.007 and p = 0.001, respectively). The density of Iba-1-positive microglia was lower in the subcortical WM of the parietal lobes (p = 0.010) in the Vent+hAECs group but not in the periventricular WM. The number of vessels in the WM of the parietal lobe exhibiting protein extravasation was lower (p = 0.046) in the Vent+hAECs group. Claudin-1 mRNA levels were higher in the periventricular WM (p = 0.005). The density of GFAP-positive astrocytes was not different between groups. Conclusions: Administration of hAECs at the time of birth alters the effects of injurious ventilation on the preterm neonatal brain. Further studies are required to understand the regional differences in the effects of hAECs on ventilation-induced WM pathology and their net effect on the developing brain. © 2015 S.

Environmental conditions and gaps in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices may contribute to the risk of infection, particularly in settings where health centers are expanding to meet the growing demand for skilled care at birth and homes do not have adequate access to water and sanitation. A qualitative approach was used to understand the environmental context for infection prevention and control (IPC) and WASH associated behaviors in health centers where women give birth, and in homes of newborns, in a rural Cambodian province. Structured observations and focus group discussions revealed important gaps in optimal practices, and both structural and social barriers to maintaining IPC during delivery and postpartum. Solutions are available to address the issues identified, and tackling these could result in marked environmental improvement for quality of care and neonatal outcomes. Water, sanitation and hygiene in home and health center environments are likely to be important contributors to health and should be addressed in strategies to improve neonatal survival. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Health facility strengthening; Hygiene; Neonatal infection; Newborn mortality; Qualitative research; Structured observation; WASH","You, D., Bastian, P., Wu, J., Wardlow, T., (2013) Levels and Trends in Child Mortality.

The current study investigated the potential influence of the intervention on children's self-reported and parental proxy-reported quality of life (QoL) at children's age of nine. Methods: Participants were randomized to either intervention (PI, n = 72) or preterm control (PC, n = 74) in the neonatal care unit, while healthy term-born infants were recruited to a term reference group (TR, n = 75). The intervention was a modified version of the Mother-Infant Transaction Program, and comprised eight one-hour sessions during the last week before discharge and four home visits at 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks post-discharge. The two control groups received care in accordance with written guidelines drawn up at the hospital. Participants and parents reported QoL independently on the Kinder Lebensqualität Fragebogen (KINDL) questionnaire. Differences between groups were analyzed by SPSS; Linear Mixed Models and parent-child agreement were analyzed and compared by intra-class correlations within each group. Results: On average, children in all groups reported high levels of well-being. The PI children reported better physical well-being than the PC children (p = 0.002). In all other aspects of QoL both the PI and the PC children reported at similar levels as the term reference group. PI parents reported better emotional wellbeing (p = 0.05) and a higher level of contentment in school (p = 0.003) compared with PC parents. Parent-child agreement was significantly weaker in the PI group than in the PC group on dimensions such as emotional well-being and relationships with friends (p < 0.05). PI parents reported QoL similar to parents of terms on all aspects except the subscale self-esteem, while PC parents generally reported moderately lower QoL than TR parents. Conclusions: This early intervention appears to have generated long-lasting positive effects, improving perceived physical well-being among prematurely born children and parent's perception of these children's QoL in middle childhood. © Landsem et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Early intervention; Long-term follow-up; Preterm children; Quality of life","Colver, A., Jessen, C., Measurement of health status and quality of life in neonatal follow-up studies (2000) Semin Neonatol, 5, pp. 149-157; Aarnoudse-Moens, C., Weisglas-Kuperus, N., Goudoever, J.B., Oosterlaan, J., Meta-analysis of neurobehavioral outcomes in very preterm and/or very low birth weight children (2009) Pediatrics, 124 (2), pp. 717-728; Aylward, G.P., Neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants born prematurely (2005) Dev Behav Pediatr, 26 (6), pp. 427-441; Fawke, J., Neurological outcomes following preterm birth (2007) Semin Fetal Neonat Med, 12, pp. 374-382; Bhutta, A.T., Cleves, M.A., Casey, P.H., Cradock, M.M., Anand, K.J.S., Cognitive and behavioral outcomes of school-aged children who were born preterm (2002) JAMA, 288 (2), pp. 728-737; Saigal, S., Tyson, J., Measurement of quality of life of survivors of neonatal intensive care: critique and implications (2008) Semin Neonatol, 32, pp. 59-66; Bastiaansen, D., Koot, H.M., Ferdinand, R.F., Psychopathology in children: improvement of quality of life without psychiatric symptom reduction?

The patients were grouped according to their intrauterine status, and sub-grouped according to the number of fetal hearts observed; singleton control (n = 1128), twin control (n = 566), singleton septum (n = 217) and twin septum (n = 113). The primary outcomes analyzed were miscarriage, preterm, very preterm, stillbirth, vanishing twin and live delivery rates, as well as low birth weight and very low birth weight rates.Result(s): The live birth rate (89,9 %) in the singleton control subgroup was non-significantly higher than the live birth rate (85,3 %) in the septum subgroup, with a RR of 1,05 (p = 0,0583, 95 % CI 0,9943–1,1182) for live birth. In contrast the live birth rate (91,3 %) in twin control subgroup was significantly higher than the live birth rate (84,1 %) in the septum subgroup, with a RR 1,09 (p = 0,0282, 95 % CI 0,9988–1,1819). Non-significantly, higher miscarriage and stillbirth rates were the main contributors to the reduced live birth rates. The singleton and twin septum subgroups also had higher rates of premature and very premature delivery and LBWs and vLBW, especially in the singleton septum subgroup.Conclusion(s): The hysteroscopic correction of intrauterine septa may not eliminate all risks for premature delivery. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Hysteroscopy; Live birth; Miscarriage; Partial intrauterine septum; Preterm delivery",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923241534

Using numerical simulation results for our models, we describe how the customary definitions of component and demographic Allee effects, which work well for single species models, can be extended to predators in predator–prey models by assuming that the prey population is held fixed. We also find that when the prey population is not held fixed, then these customary definitions may lead to conceptual problems. After this discussion of definitions, we explore our four models, analytically and numerically. Each of our models has a fixed point that represents predator extinction, which is always locally stable. We prove that the predator will always die out either if the initial predator population is sufficiently small or if the initial prey population is sufficiently small. Through numerical simulations, we explore co-existence fixed points. In addition, we demonstrate, by simulation, the existence of a stable limit cycle in one of our models. Finally, we derive analytical conditions for a co-existence trapping region in three of our models, and show that the fourth model cannot possess a particular kind of co-existence trapping region. We punctuate our results with comments on their real-world implications; in particular, we mention the possibility of prey resurgence from mortality events, and the possibility of failure in a biological pest control program. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Allee effect; Predator birth rate; Predator–prey model; Prey resurgence; Trapping region",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923250969

In Tanzania there are currently limited birth defects prevention strategies in place due to limited information on factors associated with the occurrence of birth defects. Methods: we conducted a case control study that included newborns born from October, 2011 through February, 2012 at 4 participating hospitals. A case was defined as any newborn of a Dar es salaam resident with a neural tube defect, orofacial clefts, limb reduction defects or musculo-skeletal defects (SBD) born during the study period. A control was defined as the next three newborns (delivered after the case) without birth defects. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis were done using Epi Info version 3.5.1. Results: a total of 400 newborns participated in the study, 100 cases and 300 controls. Factors associated with higher odds of a SBD included maternal fever (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.99; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-3.52), maternal hypertension (AOR=3.99; 95% CI: 1.67- 9.54), and low birth weight (AOR=3.48; 95% CI: 1.77-6.85). Antimalarial use during pregnancy was protective (AOR=0.48; 95% CI: 0.28-0.84). Folic acid supplementation was protective only in bivariate analysis (OR=0.56; 95% CI: 0.32-0.96). Conclusion: maternal fever, hypertension, and low birth weight are associated with higher odds of SBD. Antimalarial use during pregnancy was associated with lower odds of SBD. Early screening of pregnant mothers for hypertension and other causes of low birth weight may reduce SBD in Dar Es Salaam. © Rogath Saika Kishimba et al.","Birth defects; Mortality; Mothers; Newborns; Risk factors; Tanzania","(2009) Birth Defects, a Learning Programme for Professionals, , Perinatal Education Programme, Cape Town.

GATA4 plays an important role in embryonic heart development, hence the aim of this study was to find the association of GATA4 mutations with CHD among the south Indian CHD patients. Method: GATA4 gene was sequenced in 100 CHD patients (ASD, VSD, TOF and SV) and 200 controls. Functional significance of the observed GATA4 mutations was analyzed using PolyPhen, SIFT, PMut, Plink, Haploview, ESE finder 3.0 and CONSITE. Results: We observed a total of 19 mutations, of which, one was in 5' UTR, 10 in intronic regions, 3 in coding regions and 5 in 3' UTR. Of the above mutations, one was associated with Atrial Septal Defect (ASD), two were found to be associated with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and three (rs804280, rs4841587 and rs4841588) were strongly associated with Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD). Interestingly, one promoter mutation (-490 to 100 bp) i.e., 620 C>T (rs61277615, p-value = 0.008514), one splice junction mutation (G>A rs73203482; p-value = 9.6e-3, OR = 6.508) and one intronic mutation rs4841587 (p-value = 4.6e-3, OR = 4.758) were the most significant findings of this study. In silico analysis also proves that some of the mutations reported above are pathogenic. Conclusion: The present study found that GATA4 genetic variations are associated with ASD, TOF and VSD in South Indian patients. In silico analysis provides further evidence that some of the observed mutations are pathogenic. © 2015 Mattapally et al.","ASD; Congenital heart disease; GATA4; Mutation; South Indian patients; TOF;

New neurons migrate into HVC and later synapse with their target, arcopallial song nucleus RA (HVCRA). New HVCRA neurons respond to auditory stimuli (in anaesthetised animals), but whether and when they become functionally active during singing is unknown. We studied this, using 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine to birth-date neurons, combined with immunohistochemical detection of immediate-early gene (IEG) expression and retrograde tracer injections into RA to track connectivity. Interestingly, singing was followed by IEG expression in a substantial fraction of new neurons that were not retrogradely labelled from RA, suggesting a possible role in HVC-intrinsic network function. As new HVC neurons matured, the proportion of HVCRA neurons that expressed IEGs after singing increased significantly. Since it was previously shown that singing induces IEG expression in HVC also in deaf birds and that hearing song does not induce IEG expression in HVC, our data provide the first direct evidence that new HVC neurons are engaged in song motor behaviour. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Adult neurogenesis; Immediate-early genes; Maturation; Vocal control; Vocalisations",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923037465

In both the groups, topical anesthesia was provided by instilling paracaine eye drops twice at 10 min interval just before the laser treatment. Main outcome was Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) recorded before and 30 s after starting the laser treatment.Results: Birth weight, gestation, stage and extent of ROP and other baseline variables were comparable among neonates randomized to dextrose (n = 12) or control (n = 12) groups. Both groups required comparable number of laser spots. PIPP scores was comparable in neonates randomized to dextrose or control groups and indicated significant amount of pain felt during laser ablation despite local anesthesia with or without oral dextrose.Conclusions: Single dose of oral dextrose did not significantly reduce pain during laser treatment in premature neonates. Further studies with multiple doses of dextrose and its combination with other non-pharmacological (e.g., behavioral, physical) interventions may be needed. © 2015 Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation","Neonate; Pain; Retinopathy of prematurity",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923066366

The objective of this study was to compare the acoustic-mechanical properties of outer and middle ear using Sweep Frequency Impedance (SFI) measures between Australian Aboriginal and Caucasian neonates. Methods: SFI data from 40 ears of 24 Aboriginal neonates (16 males, 8 females) with mean gestational age of 39.57 weeks (SD = 1.25) and 160 ears of 119 Caucasian neonates (57 males, 62 females) with mean gestational age of 39.28 weeks (SD = 1.25) serving as controls were analysed. SFI data in terms of resonance frequency (RF) and mobility of the outer and middle ear (δSPL) were collected from neonates who passed a test battery that included automated auditory brainstem response, distortion product otoacoustic emissions test and 1000-Hz tympanometry. SFI data were analysed using descriptive statistics and analysis of variance. Results: There was no significant difference in mean gestational age, age of testing and birth weight between the Aboriginal and Caucasian neonates. The mean resonance frequencies for the outer ear (mean RF1 = 264.9. Hz, SD = 58.6. Hz) and middle ear (mean RF2 = 1144. Hz, SD = 228.8. Hz) for Aboriginal neonates were significantly lower than that of Caucasian neonates (mean RF1 = 295.3. Hz, SD = 78.4. Hz and mean RF2 = 1241.8. Hz, SD = 216.6. Hz). However, no significant difference in the mobility of outer ear (δSPL1) and middle ear (δSPL2) between the two groups was found. Middle ear resonance was absent in 22.5% (9 ears) of Aboriginal ears but present in all Caucasian ears. Conclusions: This study provided evidence that despite passing the test battery, Aboriginal neonates had significantly lower resonance frequencies of the outer and middle ear than Caucasian neonates. Furthermore, 22.5% of Aboriginal neonates showed no middle ear resonance, indicating the possibility of subtle middle ear issues not detected by the test battery. Reasons for the different acoustic-mechanical properties between the two ethnic groups remain unclear and require further investigation. © 2015.","Aboriginal; Acoustic-mechanical properties; Caucasian; Middle ear; Neonates; Sweep frequency impedance measure",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928388230

It was previously demonstrated that CaCCmediated Cl- current and Cl- efflux are absent in the acinar cells of systemic Tmem16A (Tmem16A Cl- channel) null mice, but salivation was not assessed in fully developed glands because Tmem16A null mice die within a few days after birth. To test the role of Tmem16A in adult salivary glands, we generated conditional knockout mice lacking Tmem16A in acinar cells ( Tmem16A-/ -). Ca2+-dependent salivation was abolished in Tmem16A-/ - mice, demonstrating that Tmem16A is obligatory for Ca2+-mediated fluid secretion. However, the amount of saliva secreted by Tmem16A-/ - mice in response to the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (IPR) was comparable to that seen in controls, indicating that Tmem16A does not significantly contribute to cAMP-induced secretion. Furthermore, IPR-stimulated secretion was unaffected in mice lacking Cftr (CftrΔF508/ΔF508) or ClC-2 (Clcn2-/ -) Cl- channels. The time course for activation of IPR-stimulated fluid secretion closely correlated with that of the IPR-induced cell volume increase, suggesting that acinar swelling may activate a volume-sensitive Cl- channel. Indeed, Cl- channel blockers abolished fluid secretion, indicating that Cl- channel activity is critical for IPR-stimulated secretion. These data suggest that β- adrenergic - induced, cAMP-dependent fluid secretion involves a volume-regulated anion channel. In summary, our results using acinar-specific Tmem16A-/ - mice identify Tmem16A as the Cl- channel essential for muscarinic, Ca2+-dependent fluid secretion in adult mouse salivary glands. acinar cell secretion Cl- channel Tmem16A/Ano1 Cftr channel We thank the University of Cincinnati Animal Core Facility for the design and generation of the exon 12-floxed Tmem16A mouse.

High fat diets cause alterations in colonic microbiota composition and increase gut permeability to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and subsequent low-grade chronic inflammation in mice. Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases are increasing worldwide and may involve alterations in microbiota-host dialog. Metabolic disorders appearing in later life are also suspected to reflect changes in early programming. However, how the latter affects the colon remains poorly studied. Here, we hypothesized that various components of colonic physiology, including permeability, ion exchange and protective inducible heat shock proteins (HSP) are influenced in the short- and long-terms by early disturbances in microbial colonization. The hypothesis was tested in a swine model. Offspring were born to control mothers (n = 12) or mothers treated with the antibiotic (ATB) amoxicillin around parturition (n = 11). Offspring were slaughtered between 14 and 42 days of age to study short-term effects. For long-term effects, young adult offspring from the same litters consumed a normal or a palm oil-enriched diet for 4 weeks between 140 and 169 days of age. ATB treatment transiently modified maternal fecal microbiota although the minor differences observed for offspring colonic microbiota were nonsignificant. In the short-term, consistently higher HSP27 and HSP70 levels and transiently increased horseradish peroxidase permeability in ATB offspring colon were observed. Importantly, long-term consequences included reduced colonic horseradish peroxidase permeability, and increased colonic digesta alkaline phosphatase (AP) and TLR2- and TLR4-stimulant concentrations in rectal digesta in adult ATB offspring. Inducible HSP27 and HSP70 did not change. Interactions between early ATB treatment and later diet were noted for paracellular permeability and concentrations of colonic digesta AP. In conclusion, our data suggest that early ATB-induced changes in bacterial colonization modulate important aspects of colonic physiology in the short- and longterms.

Microbial colonization of the intestine is thought to play a particularly important role in postnatal development of the gastrointestinal, metabolic, and immune systems. Major changes in environmental exposure occur right after birth, upon weaning, and during pubertal maturation into adulthood. These transitions include dramatic changes in intestinal contents and require appropriate adaptations to meet changes in functional demands. Here, we attempt to both characterize and provide mechanistic insights into postnatal intestinal ontogeny. We investigated changes in global intestinal gene expression through postnatal developmental transitions. We report profound alterations in small and large intestinal transcriptional programs that accompany both weaning and puberty in WT mice. Using myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)/TIR-domaincontaining adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) double knockout littermates, we define the role of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin (IL)-1 receptor family member signaling in postnatal gene expression programs and select ontogeny-specific phenotypes, such as vascular and smooth muscle development and neonatal epithelial and mast cell homeostasis. Metaanalysis of the effect of the microbiota on intestinal gene expression allowed for mechanistic classification of developmentally regulated genes by TLR/IL-1R (TIR) signaling and/or indigenous microbes. We find that practically every aspect of intestinal physiology is affected by postnatal transitions. Developmental timing, microbial colonization, and TIR signaling seem to play distinct and specific roles in regulation of gene-expression programs throughout postnatal development.","Innate immunity;

We conducted a population-based case-control study of 1,510,064 singleton births from the Taiwanese birth registry during 2001-2007. Of the total of 1,510,064 births, we designated all 86,224 preterm births as the case group and then randomly selected an additional 344,896 from the remaining births (equivalent to 4 full-term births for every 1 preterm birth) as the control sample. We used an inverse distance weighting approach to calculate an average exposure parameter for air pollutants. The adjusted odds ratio for preterm birth per 10-ppb increase in ozone was 1.12 (95% confidence interval: 1.01, 1.23) for women with gestational diabetes mellitus who were exposed in the third trimester and 1.02 (95% confidence interval: 1.01, 1.03) for women without gestational diabetes (P for interaction <0.001). These findings suggest that exposure to ozone in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, particularly for women who have gestational diabetes mellitus. © The Author 2015.

Whether birth weight modifies the risk of endometriosis in adulthood remains an open question. For this purpose, we designed a case-control study involving 743 women operated on for benign gynecological indications from January 2004 to December 2011. Study group included 368 patients with histologically proven endometriosis: 54 superficial endometriosis (SUP), 79 endometriomas (OMA) and 235 deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). Control group included 375 patients without endometriosis as surgically checked. Mean birth weights were compared between patients and controls, according to endometriosis groups and rAFS stages. Mean birth weight was significantly lower for patients with endometriosis as compared to controls (3,119g ± 614 and 3,251g ± 557 respectively; p = 0.002). When compared to controls, patients with DIE had the lowest birth weight with a highly significant difference (3,103g ± 620, p = 0.002). In univariate analysis, patients with low birth weight (LBW), defined as a BW < 2,500g, had a higher risk of endometriosis, especially DIE, as compared to the reference group (OR = 1.5, 95%CI: 1.0-2.3 and OR = 1.7, 95%CI: 1.0-2.7, respectively). Multivariate analysis, adjusted on ethnicity and smoking status, showed the persistence of a significant association between endometriosis and LBW with a slight increase in the magnitude of the association (aOR = 1.7, 95%CI: 1.0-2.6 for endometriosis, aOR = 1.8; 95%CI: 1.1-2.9 for DIE). In conclusion, LBW is independently associated with the risk of endometriosis in our population. Among patients with LBW, the risk is almost two-times higher to develop DIE. This association could reflect common signaling pathways between endometriosis and fetal growth regulation.

We apply the synthetic control group method and estimate the consequences for life expectancy, mortality, and birth rates. According to standard measures of fit, the method seems to perform well for all countries and outcomes. Our results show a large effect on life expectancy and mortality in two countries, and a small and insignificant effect on birth rates. The impact of the pandemic is very heterogeneous. In Mozambique, the impact of HIV on life expectancy and mortality appears to have been surprisingly small. This heterogeneity is not due to AIDS causing fewer deaths in Mozambique than in the two other countries. Instead, the net effect of HIV in Mozambique appears to be diminished by reduced mortality for other causes—in particular child mortality, respiratory infections, and injuries. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","AIDS; Fertility; HIV; Life expectancy; Mortality; Synthetic control groups",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922693440

The objective of this study was to investigate whether the cervicovaginal (CV) metabolome was different in asymptomatic women destined to have a PTB compared with term birth. Study Design: A nested case-control study was performed using CV fluid collected from a larger prospective cohort. The CV fluid was collected between 20-24 weeks (V1) and 24-28 weeks (V2). The metabolome was compared between women with a spontaneous PTB (n= 10) to women who delivered at term (n= 10). Samples were extracted and prepared for analysis using a standard extraction solvent method. Global biochemical profiles were determined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. An ANOVA was used to detect differences in biochemical compounds between the groups. A false discovery rate was estimated to account for multiple comparisons. Results: A total of 313 biochemicals were identified in CV fluid. Eighty-two biochemicals were different in the CV fluid at V1 in those destined to have a PTB compared with term birth, whereas 48 were different at V2. Amino acid, carbohydrate, and peptide metabolites were distinct between women with and without PTB. Conclusion: These data suggest that the CV space is metabolically active during pregnancy. Changes in the CV metabolome may be observed weeks, if not months, prior to any clinical symptoms. Understanding the CV metabolome may hold promise for unraveling the pathogenesis of PTB and may provide novel biomarkers to identify women most at risk. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Cervicovaginal metabolome; Pregnancy; Preterm birth",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928024618

We set out to identify the risk factors that contribute to the burden of severe hyperbilirubinemia in the most developmentally disadvantaged LMICs to highlight areas for action and further research. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Ovid EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), WHO Library Database (WHOLIS), African Index Medicus (AIM), African Journals Online (AJOL), LILACS, and IndMed for reports published between January 1990 and June 2014. We included only studies that controlled for the effects of confounding variables in determining maternal and infant risk factors for severe hyperbilirubinemia. We conducted meta-analysis of the eligible studies and computed the summary risk estimates with random effects models. Results: A total of 13 studies with 1,951 subjects and 32,208 controls from India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Nepal and Egypt were identified and analyzed. The pooled data showed that primiparity (OR, 1.59; 95% CI:1.26-2.00), delivery outside public hospitals (OR, 6.42; 95% CI:1.76-23.36), ABO incompatibility (OR, 4.01; 95%CI:2.44-6.61), Rhesus hemolytic disease (OR, 20.63; 95%CI:3.95-107.65), G6PD deficiency (OR, 8.01; 95%CI:2.09-30.69), UGT1A1 polymorphisms (OR, 4.92; 95%CI:1.30-18.62), low gestational age (OR, 1.71; 95% CI:1.40-2.11), underweight/weight loss (OR, 6.26; 95% CI:1.23-31.86), sepsis (OR, 9.15; 95%CI:2.78-30.10) and high transcutaneous/total serum bilirubin levels (OR, 1.46; 95%CI:1.10-1.92) placed infants at increased risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia or bilirubin induced neurologic dysfunctions. Low social class was not associated with an increased risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia. Conclusions: Infants at risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia in LMICs are associated with maternal and neonatal factors that can be effectively addressed by available interventions to curtail the disease burden prevailing in the affected countries. © 2015 Olusanya et al.",,"Clinical signs that predict severe illness in children under age 2 months: A multicentre study (2008) Lancet, 371, pp. 135-142. , PMID: 18191685; Burke, B.L., Robbins, J.M., Bird, T.M., Hobbs, C.A., Nesmith, C., Trends in hospitalizations for neonatal jaundice and kernicterus in the United States, 1988-2005 (2009) Pediatrics, 123, pp. 524-532. , PMID: 19171618; Hameed, N.N., Na'Ma, A.M., Vilms, R., Bhutani, V.K., Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and adverse short-term consequences in Baghdad, Iraq (2011) Neonatology, 100, pp. 57-63. , PMID: 21212697; English, M., Ngama, M., Musumba, C., Wamola, B., Bwika, J., Causes and outcome of young infant admissions to a Kenyan district hospital (2003) Arch Dis Child, 88, pp. 438-443. , PMID: 12716721; Mwaniki, M.K., Atieno, M., Lawn, J.E., Newton, C.R., Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes after intrauterine and neonatal insults: A systematic review (2012) Lancet, 379, pp. 445-452. , PMID: 22244654; Maulik, P.K., Darmstadt, G.L., Childhood disability in low- and middle-income countries: Overview of screening, prevention, services, legislation, and epidemiology (2007) Pediatrics, 120, pp. S1-S55; American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), Management of hyperbilirubinaemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation (2004) Pediatrics, 114, pp. 297-316. , PMID: 15231951; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, (2010) Neonatal Jaundice.

Thirty primiparous non lactating rabbit does were artificially inseminated and randomly divided in three treatment groups: Control (C; fed to 100% of maintenance requirements throughout gestation, n = 10), early undernourished (EU; fed to 50% of maintenance requirements during days 7-19 of gestation, n = 10) and late undernourished (LU; fed to 50% of maintenance requirements during days 20-27 of gestation, n = 10). During the 4th week of the gestation period, LU does significantly lost weight compared to C and EU groups (P&lt;0.05). At kindling, C does produced litters with higher proportions of stillborn kits (P&lt;0.05) while the total litter size (alive and stillborn kits) was not different among groups (10.7, 12.8 and 12.7 kits in C, EU and LU groups, respectively). Kit birth weight tended to be lower in the LU group. During fattening, body weight and feed intake were not different among offsprings of the three experimental groups. Moreover, the maternal undernutrition did not have any impact on carcass composition of the offsprings in terms of carcass parts and internal organs weights as well as meat quality of L. lumborum muscle (pH24, colour, water holding capacity and shear values) at slaughter (70 days of age). Therefore, it can be concluded that the gestational undernutrition of the mother does not have detrimental effects on the productive and quality traits of the offsprings. © 2015 Symeon et al.",,"Barker, D.J.P., Fetal origins of coronary heart disease (1995) BMJ, 311, pp. 171-174. , PMID: 7613432; Armitage, J.A., Khan, I.Y., Taylor, P.D., Nathanielsz, P.W., Poston, L., Developmental programming of metabolic syndrome by maternal nutritional imbalance; how strong is the evidence from experimental models in mammals?

A number of independent studies have investigated the association between hormonal factors and papillary thyroid cancer risk in women but yielded conflicting and inconclusive findings. We performed a meta-analysis of all currently published studies to provide better estimates for the risk of papillary thyroid cancer related to menstrual, reproductive, and other hormonal factors in women. Six cohort studies and three case–control ones were included into our study after a comprehensive literature search. The pooled relative risk (RR) with 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) implicated that late age at menopause was associated with an increased risk of papillary thyroid cancer (RR = 1.39, 95 % CI 1.03–1.89, P = 0.032). No significant association was demonstrated between papillary thyroid cancer risk and other hormone-related factors, including oral contraceptive, hormone replacement therapy, age at menarche, parity, age at first birth, menopausal status, and breast feeding. Subgroup analysis by study design confirmed those associations. Sensitivity analysis did not materially alter the pooled results. The meta-analysis firstly suggests that late age at menopause is a risk factor for papillary thyroid cancer. © 2015 International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM)","Menstrual factors; Meta-analysis; Papillary thyroid cancer; Reproductive factors",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922611633

THs play an essential role in brain development and hormone deficiency during critical phases in fetal life may lead to severe and permanent brain damage. Maternal hypothyroidism is considered the most common cause of fetal TH deficiency, but the problem may also arise in the fetus. In the case of congenital hypothyroidism due to defects in fetal thyroid gland development or hormone synthesis, clinical symptoms at birth are often mild as a result of compensatory maternal TH supply. TH transporters (THTs) and deiodinases (Ds) are important regulators of intracellular triiodothyronine (T3) availability and therefore contribute to the control of thyroid receptors (TRs)-dependent CNS development and early embryonic life. Defects in fetal THTs or Ds may have more impact on fetal brain since they can result in intracellular T3 deficiency despite sufficient maternal TH supply. One clear example is the recent discovery of mutations in the TH transporter (monocarboxylate transporter 8; MCT8) that could be linked to a syndrome of severe and non reversible psychomotor retardation. Even mild and transient changes in maternal TH levels can directly affect and alter the gene expression profile, and thus disturb fetal brain development. Animal studies are needed to increase our understanding of the exact role of THTs and Ds in prenatal brain development. © 2015 Ahmed; licensee BioMed Central.","Brain development; Deiodinases; Hypothyroidism; Transporters","Abedelhaffez, A.S., Hassan, A., Brain derived neurotrophic factor and oxidative stress index in pups with developmental hypothyroidism: Neuroprotective effects of selenium (2013) Acta Physiol Hung, 100 (2), pp. 197-210. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXpvFaru78%3D 23708947; Ahmed, R.G., Incerpi, S., Gestational doxorubicin alters fetal thyroid-brain axis (2013) Int J Dev Neurosci., 31, pp. 96-104. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXhsVOlu7o%3D 23183240; Gilbert, M.E., Ramos, R.L., McCloskey, D.P., Goodman, J.H., Subcortical band heterotopia in rat offspring following maternal hypothyroxinaemia: Structural and functional characteristics (2014) J Neuroendocrinol, 26 (8), pp. 528-541. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXhtFyitLbJ 24889016; Rovet, J.F., The role of thyroid hormones for brain development and cognitive function (2014) Endocr Dev., 26, pp. 26-43. , 25231442; Sánchez-Huerta, K., Pacheco-Rosado, J., Gilbert, M.E., Adult onset-hypothyroidism: Alterations in hippocampal field potentials in the dentate gyrus are largely associated with anesthesia-induced hypothermia (2015) J Neuroendocrinol., 27, pp. 8-19. , 25327136; Sawano, E., Takahashi, M., Negishi, T., Tashiro, T., Thyroid hormone-dependent development of the GABAergic pre- and post-synaptic components in the rat hippocampus (2013) Int J Dev Neurosci, 31 (8), pp. 751-761. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXhvFWis7nF 24076339; Shimokawa, N., Yousefi, B., Morioka, S., Yamaguchi, S., Ohsawa, A., Hayashi, H., Altered cerebellum development and dopamine distribution in a rat genetic model with congenital hypothyroidism (2014) J Neuroendocrinol, 26 (3), pp. 164-175. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXkvVGnsrg%3D 24460919; Ahmed, O.M., Abd El-Tawab, S.M., Ahmed, R.G., Effects of experimentally induced maternal hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism on the development of rat offspring: I- The development of the thyroid hormones-neurotransmitters and adenosinergic system interactions (2010) Int J Dev Neurosci., 28, pp. 437-454. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3cXpvVGltLs%3D 20599606; Ahmed, O.M., Ahmed, R.G., El-Gareib, A.W., El-Bakry, A.M., Abd El-Tawaba, S.M., Effects of experimentally induced maternal hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism on the development of rat offspring: II-the developmental pattern of neurons in relation to oxidative stress and antioxidant defense system (2012) Int J Dev Neurosci., 30, pp. 517-537. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38XptlWqs7g%3D 22664656; Ahmed, O.M., Ahmed, R.G., Hypothyroidism (2012) A New Look at Hypothyroidism, pp. 1-20. , Dr. D.

Kernicterus generally occurs in untreated hyperbilirubinemia or cases where treatment is delayed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based studies have shown characteristic findings in kernicterus. The objective of our study was to describe the role of 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in demonstrating these metabolic changes and to review conventional MRI findings of kernicterus. Material/Methods: Forty-eight pediatric cases with kernicterus were included in this study. MRI and MRS examinations were performed on variable dates (10-29 days after birth). NAA, Cr, Cho, NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, and Cho/Cr values were evaluated visually and by computer analysis. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the NAA and Cho levels in the acute kernicterus patients and the control group (healthy patients), whereas both were significantly elevated in the chronic kernicterus patients. Both the mean NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratio values were significantly higher in the acute and chronic cases compared to the control group. The NAA/Cho ratio value was statistically lower in the acute cases than in the control group while it was similar in the chronic cases. Conclusions: Conventional MR imaging and 1H-MRS are important complementary tools in the diagnostics of neonatal bilirubin encephalopathy. This study provided important information for applying these MR modalities in the evaluation of neonates with bilirubin encephalopathy. © Pol J Radiol, 2015.","Infant, Newborn; Kernicterus; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy","Menkes, J.H., Textbook of Child Neurology, 613p. , 5th ed; Cremer, R.J., Perryman, P.W., Richards, D.H., Influence of light on the hyperbilirubinemia of infants (1958) Lancet, 1, pp. 1094-1097; Labrune, P., Severe hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn: Definition and management (1998) Arch Pediatr, 5, pp. 1162-1167; Shapiro, S.M., Bilirubin toxicity in the developing nervous system (2003) Pediatr Neurol, 29, pp. 410-421; Sugama, S., Soeda, A., Eto, Y., Magnetic resonance imaging in three children with kernicterus (2001) Pediatr Neurol, 25, pp. 328-331; Steinborn, M., Seelos, K.C., Heuck, A., MR findings in a patient with kernicterus (1999) Eur Radiol, 9, pp. 1939-1945; Govaert, P., Lequin, M., Swarte, R., Changes in globus pallidus with (Pre)term kernicterus (2003) Pediatrics, 112, pp. 1256-1263; Silva, R., Mata, L., Gulbenkian, S., Inhibition of glutamate uptake by unconjugated bilirubin in cultured cortical rat astrocytes: Role of concentration and pH (1999) Biochem Biophys Res Comm, 265, pp. 67-72; McDonald, J., Shapiro, S., Silverstein, F., Role of glutamate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity in bilirubin-induced brain injury in the Gunn rat model (1998) Exp Neurol, 150, pp. 21-29; Kreis, R., Hofmann, L., Kuhlmann, B., Brain metabolite composition during early human brain development as measured by quantitative in vivo H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (2002) Mang Reson Med, 48, pp. 949-958; Brown, A., L Erythrocyte metabolism and hemolysis in the newborn (1966) Pediatr Clin North Am, 13, pp. 879-903; Newman, A.J., Gross, S., Hyperbilirubinemia in breast fed infants (1963) Pediatrics, 32, pp. 995-1001; Devecioglu, C., Katar, S., Dogru, O., Henna-inducedhemolytic anemia and acute renal failure (2001) Turk J Pediatr, 43, pp. 65-66; Arias, I.M., Wolfson, S., Lucey, J.F., Transient familial neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (1965) J Clin Invest, 44, pp. 1442-1450; Friede, R.L., (1989) Developmental Neuropathy, , Berlin: Springer-Verlag; Martich-Kriss, V., Kolias, S.S., Ball, W.S., MR findings in kernicterus (1995) Am J Neuroradiol, 16, pp. 819-821; Piazza, A.J., Stoll, B.J., Kernicterus (2007) Nelson Textbook of Pediartics, pp. 761-765. , Kliegman RM, Jenson HB, Berhman RE, Stanton BF (eds.), 18th ed).

In the current study, we evaluated the association between maternal exposure to HAPs identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and spina bifida in offspring using hierarchical Bayesian modeling that includes Stochastic Search Variable Selection (SSVS). Methods: The Texas Birth Defects Registry provided data on spina bifida cases delivered between 1999 and 2004. The control group was a random sample of unaffected live births, frequency matched to cases on year of birth. Census tract-level estimates of annual HAP levels were obtained from the U.S. EPA's 1999 Assessment System for Population Exposure Nationwide. Using the distribution among controls, exposure was categorized as high exposure (>95th percentile), medium exposure (5th-95th percentile), and low exposure (<5th percentile, reference). We used hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression models with SSVS to evaluate the association between HAPs and spina bifida by computing an odds ratio (OR) for each HAP using the posterior mean, and a 95% credible interval (CI) using the 2.5th and 97.5th quantiles of the posterior samples. Based on previous assessments, any pollutant with a Bayes factor greater than 1 was selected for inclusion in a final model. Results: Twenty-five HAPs were selected in the final analysis to represent ""bins"" of highly correlated HAPs (ρ > 0.80). We identified two out of 25 HAPs with a Bayes factor greater than 1: quinoline (OR<inf>high</inf> = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.11-3.87, Bayes factor = 1.01) and trichloroethylene (OR<inf>medium</inf> = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.14-3.61, Bayes factor = 3.79). Conclusions: Overall there is evidence that quinoline and trichloroethylene may be significant contributors to the risk of spina bifida. Additionally, the use of Bayesian hierarchical models with SSVS is an alternative approach in the evaluation of multiple environmental pollutants on disease risk. This approach can be easily extended to environmental exposures, where novel approaches are needed in the context of multi-pollutant modeling. © 2015 Swartz et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Bayesian hierarchical models; Birth defects; Hazardous air pollutants; Maternal exposure; Multi-pollutant; Spina bifida",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929008196

Infant feeding data were collected using 24 h recall of nineteen food and fluid items.Setting: A township near Durban, South Africa.Subjects: Pregnant women (1894 intervention and 2243 control) aged 17 years or more.Results: Twelve weeks after birth, 1629 (intervention) and 1865 (control) mother–infant pairs were available for analysis. Socio-economic conditions differed slightly across intervention groups, which were considered in the analyses. There was no effect on early initiation of breast-feeding. At 12 weeks of age the intervention doubled exclusive breast-feeding (OR=2·29; 95 % CI 1·80, 2·92), increased exclusive formula-feeding (OR=1·70; 95 % CI 1·28, 2·27), increased predominant breast-feeding (OR=1·71; 95 % CI 1·34, 2·19), decreased mixed formula-feeding (OR=0·68; 95 % CI 0·55, 0·83) and decreased mixed breast-feeding (OR=0·54; 95 % CI 0·44, 0·67). The effect on exclusive breast-feeding at 12 weeks was stronger among HIV-negative mothers than HIV-positive mothers (P=0·01), while the effect on mixed formula-feeding was significant only among HIV-positive mothers (P=0·03). The effect on exclusive feeding was not different by household wealth or maternal education levels.Conclusions: A perinatal intervention package delivered by community health workers was effective in increasing exclusive breast-feeding, exclusive formula-feeding and decreasing mixed feeding.

Study Design: Ninety four small (estimated fetal weight <10th centile) and 71 AGA fetuses were included. Small fetuses were further subdivided into fetal growth restriction (IUGR, n = 64) and small for gestational age (SGA, n = 30) based on poor perinatal outcome factors, that is, birth weight <3rd centile and/or abnormal cerebroplacental ratio and/or uterine artery Doppler. The entire cohort was scanned to assess CC by transvaginal neurosonography obtaining axial, coronal and midsagittal images. CC length, thickness, total area and the areas after a subdivision in 7 portions were evaluated by semiautomatic software. Furthermore, the weekly average growth of the CC in each study group was calculated and compared. Results: Small fetuses showed significantly shorter (small fetuses: 0.49 vs. AGA: 0.52; p < 0.01) and smaller CC (1.83 vs. 2.03; p < 0.01) with smaller splenium (0.47 vs. 0.55; p < 0.01) compared to controls. The CC growth rate was also reduced when compared to controls. Changes were more prominent in small fetuses with abnormal cerebroplacental Doppler suggesting fetal growth restriction. Conclusions: Neurosonographic assessment of CC showed significantly altered callosal development, suggesting in-utero brain reorganization in small fetuses.

The time from mating to first parturition was increased when pDmrt1-Cre;Vegfa-/- females were mated to control males (P = 0.0008) and tended to be longer for heterozygous females (P &lt; 0.07). Litter size was reduced for pDmrt1-Cre;Vegfa-/- females (P &lt; 0.007). The time between the first and second parturitions was also increased for heterozygous females (P &lt; 0.04) and tended to be increased for pDmrt1-Cre;Vegfa-/- females (P &lt; 0.07). pDmrt1- Cre;Vegfa-/- females had smaller ovaries (P &lt; 0.04), reduced plasma estradiol (P &lt; 0.007), fewer developing follicles (P &lt; 0.008) and tended to have fewer corpora lutea (P &lt; 0.08). Expression of Igf1r was reduced (P &lt; 0.05); expression of Foxo3a tended to be increased (P &lt; 0.06); and both Fshr (P &lt; 0.1) and Sirt6 tended to be reduced (P &lt; 0.06) in pDmrt1- Cre;Vegfa-/- ovaries. To compare VEGFA knockouts, we generated Amhr2-Cre;Vegfa-/- mice that required more time from mating to first parturition (P &lt; 0.003) with variable ovarian size. Both lines had more apoptotic granulosa cells, and vascular staining did not appear different. Taken together these data indicate that the loss of all VEGFA isoforms in granulosa/ germ cells (proangiogenic and antiangiogenic) causes subfertility by arresting follicular development, resulting in reduced ovulation rate and fewer pups per litter. © 2015 Sargent et al.",,"McFee, R.M., Cupp, A.S., Vascular contributions to early ovarian development: Potential roles of VEGFA isoforms (2013) Reprod Fertil Dev, 25, pp. 333-342. , PMID: 23021322;

Some studies have followed these infants through early school age and have shown some conflicting results regarding cognitive outcome. Such studies that assess children at younger ages may not accurately predict outcomes in later childhood, as it is known that fluid and crystallized intelligence peak at age 26 years. There is paucity of data in current medical literature, which correlates low-grade IVH with outcomes in early adulthood. To determine the link between the occurrence of low-grade IVH in low birth weight (birth weight ⩽2500 g) infants born prematurely (gestational age <37 weeks) and intellectual function, academic achievement, and behavioral problems to the age of 18 years.Study Design:This study is an analysis of data derived from the Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP), a multisite national collaborative study and a randomized controlled trial of education intervention for low birth weight infants from birth until 3 years of age with follow-up through 18 years of age. A total of 985 infants were enrolled in the IHDP. Of the 462 infants tested for IVH, 99 demonstrated sonographic evidence of low-grade IVH, whereas 291 showed no sonographic evidence of IVH. Several outcomes were compared between these two groups. Intelligence was assessed using Stanford–Binet Intelligence scales at age 3 years, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) at age 8 years, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) at age 18 years and Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement at age 8 and 18 years. Behavior was measured using the Achenbach Behavior Checklist at age 3 years and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at age 8 and 18 years. Outcomes were compared between the IVH-positive and IVH-negative groups using analysis of covariance after adjusting for the presence or absence of intervention, birth weight, gestational age, gender, severity of neonatal course, race and maternal education.Results:No statistically significant difference in intelligence as measured by Stanford–Binet Intelligence scales, WISC-III, WASI and Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Achievement could be appreciated between IVH-positive patients and controls at any age group (36 months, 8 years and 18 years of age). In addition, there was no significant difference in problem behavior as assessed by the Achenbach Behavior Checklist and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) comparing IVH patients with controls.Conclusion:Low-grade IVH was not demonstrated in our study to be an independent risk factor associated with lower outcomes in intelligence, academic achievement or problem behavior at age 3, 8 and 18 years.Journal of Perinatology advance online publication, 5 February 2015; doi:10.1038/jp.2014.244. © 2015 Nature America, Inc.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922613115

Vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) can be seen as a real and viable option for most women with previous CS. To achieve success, however, women need the support of their clinicians (obstetricians and midwives). The aim of this study was to evaluate clinician-centred interventions designed to increase the rate of VBAC. Methods: The bibliographic databases of The Cochrane Library, PubMed, PsychINFO and CINAHL were searched for randomised controlled trials, including cluster randomised trials that evaluated the effectiveness of any intervention targeted directly at clinicians aimed at increasing VBAC rates. Included studies were appraised independently by two reviewers. Data were extracted independently by three reviewers. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the quality assessment tool, 'Effective Public Health Practice Project'. The primary outcome measure was VBAC rates. Results: 238 citations were screened, 255 were excluded by title and abstract. 11 full-text papers were reviewed; eight were excluded, resulting in three included papers. One study evaluated the effectiveness of antepartum x-ray pelvimetry (XRP) in 306 women with one previous CS. One study evaluated the effects of external peer review on CS birth in 45 hospitals, and the third evaluated opinion leader education and audit and feedback in 16 hospitals. The use of external peer review, audit and feedback had no significant effect on VBAC rates. An educational strategy delivered by an opinion leader significantly increased VBAC rates. The use of XRP significantly increased CS rates. Conclusions: This systematic review indicates that few studies have evaluated the effects of clinician-centred interventions on VBAC rates, and interventions are of varying types which limited the ability to meta-analyse data. A further limitation is that the included studies were performed during the late 1980s-1990s. An opinion leader educational strategy confers benefit for increasing VBAC rates. This strategy should be further studied in different maternity care settings and with professionals other than physicians only. © Lundgren et al.","Clinicians; Interventions; Systematic review; VBAC","European perinatal health report (2013), http://www.europeristat.com/reports/european-perinatal-health-report-2010.html, Health and care of pregnant women and babies in Europe in 2010. 2013Alfirevic, Z., Devane, D., Gyte, G.M., Continuous cardiotocography (CTG) as a form of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) for fetal assessment during labour (2008) Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 3; Altaf, S., Oppenheimer, C., Shaw, R., Waugh, J., Dixon-Woods, M., Practice and views on fetal heart monitoring: a structured observation and interview study (2006) BJOG, 113, pp. 409-418; Hindley, C., Thomson, A.M., Intrapartum fetal monitoring and the spectre of litigation.

Comorbidity between these disorders is high. A previous investigation of our population-based twin cohort revealed that low birth weight increased the risk for development of IBS, with environmental influences in utero as the most relevant contributing factor. We hypothesise that both intrauterine and genetic factors influence the co-occurrence of IBS and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods: A postal questionnaire sent to 12700 Norwegian twins born between 1967 and 1979 comprised a checklist of 31 illnesses and symptoms, including IBS and symptoms of anxiety and depression. The influence of genetic factors and intrauterine growth on comorbidity between these disorders were analysed in the full sample and compared to those based on only monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for IBS (95 pairs) in birth weight group > 2500 g and ≥ 2500 g. Results: In the co-twin analyses restricted growth (birth weight > 2500 g) was significantly associated with anxiety and depression (average birth weight difference of 181.0 g (p >0.0001) and 249.9 g (p > 0.0001), respectively). The analysis of the full sample revealed that IBS was significantly associated with symptoms of anxiety (adjusted OR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.9, 3.3) and depression (adjusted OR = 2.3. 95% CI: 1.8, 3.0). Analyses of MZ pairs discordant for IBS indicated significant associations between IBS and symptoms of anxiety (OR = 3.7, 95% CI: 1.3, 10.5) and between IBS and symptoms of depression (OR = 4.2, 95% CI: 1.7, 9.9) only in the birth weight group below 2500 g. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that genetic factors partly explain the association between IBS and symptoms of anxiety and depression. In the low range of birth weight (>2500 g), restricted fetal growth seems to be a common contributing factor to the co-occurrence between these disorders.","Anxiety; Birth weight; Comorbidity; Depression; IBS; Norwegian twin registry (NTR)","Thompson, W.G., Irvine, E.J., Pare, P., Ferrazzi, S., Rance, L., Functional gastrointestinal disorders in Canada: first population-based survey using Rome II criteria with suggestions for improving the questionnaire (2002) Dig Dis Sci, 47 (1), pp. 225-235; Hungin, A.P., Whorwell, P.J., Tack, J., Mearin, F., The prevalence, patterns and impact of irritable bowel syndrome: an international survey of 40,000 subjects (2003) Aliment Pharmacol Ther, 17 (5), pp. 643-650; Drossman, D.A., Camilleri, M., Mayer, E.A., Whitehead, W.E., AGA technical review on irritable bowel syndrome (2002) Gastroenterology, 123 (6), pp. 2108-2131; Longstreth, G.F., Thompson, W.G., Chey, W.D., Houghton, L.A., Mearin, F., Spiller, R.C., Functional bowel disorders (2006) Gastroenterology, 130 (5), pp. 1480-1491; Whitehead, W.E., Holtkotter, B., Enck, P., Hoelzl, R., Holmes, K.D., Anthony, J., Tolerance for rectosigmoid distention in irritable bowel syndrome (1990) Gastroenterology, 98 (5), pp. 1187-1192; Vassallo, M.J., Camilleri, M., Phillips, S.F., Steadman, C.J., Talley, N.J., Hanson, R.B., Colonic tone and motility in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (1992) Mayo Clin Proc, 67 (8), pp. 725-731; Spiller, R., Aziz, Q., Creed, F., Emmanuel, A., Houghton, L., Hungin, P., Guidelines on the irritable bowel syndrome: mechanisms and practical management (2007) Gut, 56 (12), pp. 1770-1798; Bengtson, M.B., Ronning, T., Vatn, M.H., Harris, J.R., Irritable bowel syndrome in twins: genes and environment (2006) Gut, 55 (12), pp. 1754-1759; Kalantar, J.S., Locke, G.R., Zinsmeister, A.R., Beighley, C.M., Talley, N.J., Familial aggregation of irritable bowel syndrome: a prospective study (2003) Gut, 52 (12), pp. 1703-1707; Levy, R.L., Jones, K.R., Whitehead, W.E., Feld, S.I., Talley, N.J., Corey, L.A., Irritable bowel syndrome in twins: heredity and social learning both contribute to etiology (2001) Gastroenterology, 121 (4), pp. 799-804; Morris-Yates, A., Talley, N.J., Boyce, P.M., Nandurkar, S., Andrews, G., Evidence of a genetic contribution to functional bowel disorder (1998) Am J Gastroenterol, 93 (8), pp. 1311-1317; Blanchard, E.B., Lackner, J.M., Jaccard, J., Rowell, D., Carosella, A.M., Powell, C., The role of stress in symptom exacerbation among IBS patients (2008) J Psychosom Res, 64 (2), pp. 119-128; Creed, F., Ratcliffe, J., Fernandes, L., Palmer, S., Rigby, C., Tomenson, B., Outcome in severe irritable bowel syndrome with and without accompanying depressive, panic and neurasthenic disorders (2005) Br J Psychiatry, 186, pp. 507-515; Vandvik, P.O., Lydersen, S., Farup, P.G., Prevalence, comorbidity and impact of irritable bowel syndrome in Norway (2006) Scand J Gastroenterol, 41 (6), pp. 650-656; Levy, R.L., Olden, K.W., Naliboff, B.D., Bradley, L.A., Francisconi, C., Drossman, D.A., Psychosocial aspects of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (2006) Gastroenterology, 130 (5), pp. 1447-1458; Williams, R.E., Hartmann, K.E., Sandler, R.S., Miller, W.C., Steege, J.F., Prevalence and characteristics of irritable bowel syndrome among women with chronic pelvic pain (2004) Obstet Gynecol, 104 (3), pp. 452-458; Jarrett, M., Heitkemper, M., Cain, K.C., Burr, R.L., Hertig, V., Sleep disturbance influences gastrointestinal symptoms in women with irritable bowel syndrome (2000) Dig Dis Sci, 45 (5), pp. 952-959; Whitehead, W.E., Palsson, O., Jones, K.R., Systematic review of the comorbidity of irritable bowel syndrome with other disorders: what are the causes and implications?

Notably, just over one-half of unintended pregnancies occurred when birth control was being used, suggesting inappropriate or poor use or contraceptive failure. About two-thirds of all women who are of reproductive age use contraceptives, and oral hormonal contraceptives remain the most common contraceptive method. Often, contraceptive products are obtained in community pharmacies. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a pharmacy-based intervention would impact sales of contraceptive products in pharmacies. Methods: This study was conducted in Iowa and used a quasi-experimental design including 55 community pharmacies (independent and grocery) in 12 counties as the intervention and 32 grocery pharmacies in 10 counties as a comparison group. The passive intervention was focused towards 18-30 year old women who visited community pharmacies and prompted those of childbearing age to ""plan your pregnancy"" and ""consider using birth control"". The intervention was delivered via educational tri-fold brochures, posters and 'shelf talkers.' Data sources for evaluation were contraceptive sales from intervention and comparison pharmacies, and a mixed negative binomial regression was used with study group time interactions to examine the impact of the intervention on oral contraceptive and condom sales. Data from 2009 were considered baseline sales. Results: From 2009 to 2011, condom sales decreased over time and oral contraceptives sales showed no change. Overall, the units sold were significantly higher in grocery pharmacies than in independent pharmacies for both contraceptive types. In the negative binomial regression for condoms, there was an overall significant interaction between the study group and time variables (p = 0.003), indicating an effect of the intervention, and there was a significant slowing in the drop of sales at time 3 in comparison with time 1 (p 0.001). There was a statistically significant association between pharmacy type and study group, where the independent intervention pharmacies had a higher proportion of stores with increases in condom sales compared to grocery pharmacies in the intervention or comparison group. Conclusions: A passive community pharmacy-based public health intervention appeared to reduce the decrease in condom sales from baseline, particularly in independent pharmacies, but it did not impact oral contraceptive sales. © 2015 Farris et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Community pharmacy; Condoms; Oral contraceptives; Unintended pregnancy","Finer, L.B., Zolna, M.R., Unintended pregnancy in the United States: Incidence and disparities. 2006 (2011) Contraception, 84, pp. 478-485; Mayer, J.P., Unintended childbearing, maternal beliefs and delay of prenatal care (1997) Birth, 24, pp. 247-252; Orr, S.T., Miller, C.A., James, S.A., Babones, S., Unintended pregnancy and preterm birth (2000) Paed Perinatal Epid, 14, pp. 309-313; Barber, J.S., Axinn, W.G., Thornton, A., Unwanted childbearing, health, and mother-child relationships (1999) J Hth Soc Behav, 40, pp. 231-257; Facts on Unintended Pregnancy in the United States, , http://www.cdc.gov/cdcgrandrounds/archives/2014/oct2014.htm; Mosher, W.D., Jones, J., Use of contraception in the United States: 1982-2008 (2010) Vital Health Stat, 23 (29), pp. 1-44. , National Center for Health Statistics; (2014) Contraceptive Use in the United States, , http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_contr_use.html, June; Farris, K.B., Ashwood, D., McIntosh, J., Dipietro, N.A., Monastersky Maderas, N., Cohen Landau, S., Preventing unintended pregnancy: Pharmacists' roles in practice and policy via partnerships (2010) J Am Pharm Assoc, 50, pp. 604-612; Nelson, A.L., Jaime, C.M., Accuracy of information given by Los Angeles County pharmacies about emergency contraceptives to sham patient in need (2009) Contraception, 79, pp. 206-210; Wernow, J.R., Grant, D.G., Dispensing with conscience: A legal and ethical assessment (2008) Ann Pharmacother, 42, pp. 1669-1678; Farris, K.B., Schwemm, A.K., Aquilino, M.L., Iowa pharmacists' attitudes and practices concerning unintended pregnancies (2010) J Iowa Pharm Assoc, 67, pp. 33-39; Landau, S.C., Tapias, M.P., McGhee, B.T., Birth control within reach: A national survey on women's attitudes toward and interest in pharmacy access to hormonal contraception (2006) Contraception, 74, pp. 463-470; Landau, S., Besinque, K., Chung, F., Dries-Daffner, I., Maderas, N.M., McGhee, B.T., Pharmacist interest in and attitudes toward direct pharmacy access to hormonal contraception in the United States (2009) JAPhA., 49, pp. 43-50; Rafie, S., McIntosh, J., Gardner, D.K., Gawronski, K.M., Karaoui, L.R., Koepf, E.R., Over-The-Counter access to emergency contraception with out age restriction: An opinion of the women's health practice and research network of the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (2013) Pharmcother, 33, pp. 549-557; McIntosh, J., Rafie, S., Wasik, M., McBane, S., Lodise, N.M., El-Ibiary, S.Y., Changing oral contraceptives from prescription to Over-The-Counter status: An opinion statement of the women's health practice and research network of the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (2011) Pharmacother, 31, pp. 424-437; Chisholm-Burns, M.A., Kim, L.J., Spivey, C.A., Slack, M., Herrier, R.N., Hall-Lipsy, E., US pharmacists' effect as team members on patient care: Systematic review and meta-analyses (2010) Med Care, 48, pp. 923-933; How Pharmacists Can Improve Our Nation's Health, , http://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/programs/nhdsp_program/docs/Pharmacist_Guide.pdf; Vincent, W.R., Smith, K.M., Steinke, D., Opportunities for pharmacists in public health (2007) Am J Health Syst Pharm, 64, pp. 2002-2007; Monastersky Maderas, N.J., Landau, S.C., Pharmacy and clinic partnerships to expand access to injectable contraception (2007) J Am Pharm Assoc, 47, pp. 527-531; Gardner, J.S., Miller, L., Downing, D.F., Le Blough S, D., Shotorbani, S., Pharmacist prescribing of hormonal contraceptives: Results of the Direct Access study (2008) J Am Pharm Assoc, 48, pp. 212-222; http://www.philliberresearch.com/theiowa-and-colorado-initiativesto-reduceunintended-pregnancies.html, Iowa InitiativeContraceptive Needs and Services, 2010 County-level Table Maker, , http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/win/counties/index.html; Posey, L.M., Driving change: Pharmacy Access Partnership links pharmacists with patients (2007) Pharm Today, 12, pp. 60-64; http://now.uiowa.edu/2012/09/avoidingunexpecteddeliveries, The Iowa Initiative",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924239286

We herein examined the amniotic lamellar body count (LBC) and found it to be an accurate predictor of respiratory disorders in twin pregnancies. Methods: Five hundred fourteen amniotic fluid samples, comprising 132 dichorionic twin (DCT) and 125 monochorionic twin (MCT) gestations, were obtained at cesarean section performed at 29 to 38 gestational weeks. Samples were analyzed immediately without centrifugation. Results: There were 26 neonates (5.1%) with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and 43 (8.4%) with transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN). The LBC in neonates with TTN (5.12×104/μl) was between the counts in RDS (1.26×104/μl) and controls (10.6×104/μl), which differed significantly. Twin concordance rates were significantly higher for TTN in MCT gestations than DCT gestations (p=0.003) and delta LBC value was significantly smaller in MCT (3.15±0.4×104/μl) than DCT (5.17±0.5×104/μl) gestations (p=0.003).

To our knowledge, no previous studies have used anorectal manometry (AM) to assess this injury’s impact on the functionality of the anal sphincter complex. We hypothesized that women with levator avulsion have lower manometric pressures.Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted on 83 women, 61 in the birth group and 22 in the control group. Patients in the deliveries group were recruited in the period immediately postpartum. The control group was recruited through hospital announcements. All patients underwent 3D transperineal (3D TPUS) and 2D endoanal ultrasound (2D EAUS), as well as AM at 6 months postpartum. Median maximum resting and squeeze pressures were measured, and the presence or absence of levator ani muscle (LAM) avulsion and/or occult sphincter injury was evaluated.Results: Hiatal area at rest was significantly higher in women with vaginal birth compared with controls (p = 0.02) and there was a trend toward statistical significance compared with the cesarean section group (p = 0058). No statistical differences were observed for the hiatal area regarding Valsalva, external anal sphincter thickness, and internal anal sphincter thickness among groups. There was a significantly higher prevalence of levator avulsion in the vaginal birth group (32.43 %) compared with the controls (0 %) and the cesarean section group (5.8 %; p < 0001). There were 5 occult sphincter injuries detected at ultrasound, all of them in the vaginal birth group. Lower squeeze pressure was observed in patients with levator injury compared with control group patients and patients without avulsion (112.2 mmHg vs 128.2 mmHg and 121.2mmH; p = 0.032). Finally, there was no difference in resting pressure (p = 0.541) or squeeze pressure (p = 0.449) between patients with and those without occult anal sphincter injuries.Conclusions: Levator avulsion is associated with lower manometric squeeze pressure (p = 0.032). © 2015 The International Urogynecological Association","3D transperineal ultrasound; Anorectal manometry; Endoanal ultrasound; Levator avulsion; Obstetric anal sphincter injuries; Pelvic floor function",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922389732

Group 1 was injected with 20 U of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG), 54 h before artificial insemination (AI) and used as reference group. Group 2 was injected with 20 U of eCG+0.5 mg of PGF2α, 54 h before AI. Group 3 was orally given 3 mL of Sun/doe/day, for seven consecutive days before AI+20 U of eCG, 54 h before AI. Group 4 was treated like Group 3 except that the oil was Lin. Aged does treated with eCG+Sun had elevated blood 17-β estradiol concentration (P≤0.01) accompanied with a decrease of progesterone concentrations compared to the other experimental groups. Contrarily, no significant differences were found between eCG+Lin and eCG+PGF2α treatments on the previous two hormones. Likewise, aged does treated with eCG+Sun and eCG+Lin were statistically similar to those injected with ECG+synthetic PGF2α on blood prostaglandin profile, but still significantly higher than the control group. Treatment with eCG+Sun increased the percentage of fertile does (P≤0.01) and the litter size at birth compared to the other experimental groups. In conclusion, replacement of the PGF2α injection by oral administration of Sun or Lin to aged does improved sexual hormone synthesis and secretion, litter size and bunny body weight at birth. © A.E.

Women with a prior sPTB, with cerclage, and without delivery data available were excluded. Primary outcomes were the incidence of a CL ≤20 mm, and rates of sPTB <37, <34, and <32 weeks gestation among women with prior term births vs nulliparous women.RESULTS: A total of 1569 women underwent TVU CL screening; 18 women with a prior iatrogenic preterm birth were excluded. Of those screened, 756 (48.7%) had a prior term delivery and 795 (51.3%) were nulliparous. Women with prior term births differed from nulliparous women with respect to age, body mass index, race, smoking status, and prior dilation and curettage. After adjustment for these confounders, there was no statistical difference in the incidence of CL ≤20 mm (0.8 vs 1.4%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.12-1.03) among women with prior term births compared with nulliparous women. Rates of sPTB <37, <34, <32 weeks were similar in women with a prior term birth compared with nulliparous women. The overall incidence of sPTB <37 weeks was 3.2% in women with a prior term birth and 5.0% in nulliparous women. When a CL ≤20 mm was identified, 3 of 6 women with prior term birth delivered at <37 weeks compared with 8 of 11 nulliparous women. There were no identified differences between the odds of sPTB between women with a CL ≤20 mm who had a prior term birth compared with nulliparous women.CONCLUSION: Women with prior term birth have a trend toward a lower incidence of CL ≤20 mm, compared with nulliparous women. Further studies are needed to determine whether women with prior term births should be included or excluded from TVU CL screening. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, the mechanism that drives preferences for voices of fertile females has yet to be elucidated. The current study examined the physiological changes that occur when listening to voices recorded from naturally cycling females at high and low fertility phases of the menstrual cycle, as well as from females using hormonal contraception. We found the voices of naturally cycling females recorded during a high fertility phase were rated as more attractive and produced the greatest increase in galvanic skin response (GSR). Heart rate (HR) also showed a trend towards the highest increase when listening to naturally cycling, high fertility female voices. There were no differences in ratings of voice attractiveness, GSR, or HR between the voices recorded from females using hormonal contraception. Analyzed separately, male and female listeners both showed a preference for naturally cycling, high fertility voices. Female listeners additionally showed increased GSR and HR responses to naturally cycling, high fertility voices. We discuss the adaptive benefits of detecting vocal changes for male as well as female listeners, and also discuss the role that the nervous system plays during human mate assessments. © 2014.","Evolution; Female fertility; Galvanic skin response; Heart rate; Human physiology; Menstrual cycle cues; Voice attractiveness","Alexander, R.D., How did humans evolve?
