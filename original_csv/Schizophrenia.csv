Previous researches have reported the impacts of telomerase activity on mental illness and the potential association between NVL and major depressive disorder. To validate the susceptibility of NVL to major depressive disorder, and to investigate the overlapping risk conferred by NVL for both major depressive disorder and schizophrenia, we analyzed 9 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tag SNPs) using TaqMan® technology, in 1045 major depressive disorder patients, 1235 schizophrenia patients and 1235 normal controls of Han Chinese origin. We found that rs10916583 (P<inf>allele</inf>=0.020, P<inf>genotype</inf>=0.028, OR=1.156) and rs16846649 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=0.014, P<inf>genotype</inf>=0.007, OR=0.718) were associated with major depressive disorder, while rs10916583 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=1.08E-02, OR=1.213), rs16846649 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=7.40E-06, adjusted P<inf>genotype</inf>=8.07E-05, OR=0.598) and rs10799541 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=8.10E-03, adjusted P<inf>genotype</inf>=0.049, OR=0.826) showed statistically significant association with schizophrenia after Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, rs10916583 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=9.00E-03, adjusted P<inf>genotype</inf>=3.15E-02, OR=1.187) and rs16846649 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=8.92E-06, adjusted P<inf>genotype</inf>=8.84E-05, OR=0.653) remained strongly associated with the analysis of combined cases of major depressive disorder and schizophrenia after Bonferroni correction. Our results indicated that the NVL gene may contain overlapping common genetic risk factors for major depressive disorder and schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population. The roles of NVL in telomerase biogenesis were also highlighted in psychiatric pathogenesis. The study on variants conferring overlapping risk for multiple psychiatric disorders could be tangible pathogenesis support and clinical or diagnostic references. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Association; Major depressive disorder; NVL gene; Schizophrenia; Telomerase activity","Aviv, A., How long should telomeres be?

Genes associated with the glutamatergic system, including metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR or GRM) genes, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Few studies, however, have investigated a relationship between polymorphism of glutamate-related genes and cortical function in vivo in patients with schizophrenia. We thus explored an association between genetic variations in GRM3 and brain activation driven by a cognitive task in the prefrontal cortex in patients with schizophrenia. Materials and Methods: Thirty-one outpatients with schizophrenia and 48 healthy controls participated in this study. We measured four candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs274622, rs2299225, rs1468412, and rs6465084) of GRM3, and activity in the prefrontal and temporal cortices during a category version of a verbal fluency task, using a 52-channel near-infrared spectroscopy instrument. Results and Discussion: The rs274622 C carriers with schizophrenia were associated with significantly smaller prefrontal activation than patients with TT genotype. This between-genotype difference tended to be confined to the patient group. GRM3 polymorphisms are associated with prefrontal activation during cognitive task in schizophrenia. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Glutamatergic system; Imaging genetics; Intermediate phenotype; Verbal fluency task","Albalushi, T., Horiuchi, Y., Ishiguro, H., Koga, M., Inada, T., Iwata, N., Replication study and meta-analysis of the genetic association of GRM3 gene polymorphisms with schizophrenia in a large Japanese case-control population (2008) Am J Med Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet, 147, pp. 392-396; Baune, B.T., Suslow, T., Beste, C., Birosova, E., Domschke, K., Sehlmeyer, C., Association between genetic variants of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (GRM3) and cognitive set shifting in healthy individuals (2010) Genes Brain Behav, 9, pp. 459-466; Bertolino, A., Caforio, G., Blasi, G., De Candia, M., Latorre, V., Petruzzella, V., Interaction of COMT Val108/158 Met genotype and olanzapine treatment on prefrontal cortical function in patients with schizophrenia (2004) Am J Psychiatry, 161, pp. 1798-1805; Bishop, J.R., Miller del D, Ellingrod V L, Holman T.

In transfected HEK cells expressing the D<inf>2L</inf> receptor under an inducible promoter, LASSBio-579 and LQFM 037, but not clozapine, behaved as weak partial agonists in [35S]-GTPγS binding assays performed in optimized conditions previously shown to evidence the partial agonist profile of aripiprazole. Besides, data obtained in radioligand competition assays on rat striatal membranes suggested a rapid association to and dissociation from the D<inf>2</inf>-like receptors. Using the kinetic rate index based on the strategy of the dual-point competition association assay, we showed that our compounds share a similar kinetic profile with clozapine, distinct from the typical antipsychotic haloperidol. These two characteristics could contribute to the atypical-like profile observed after administration of LASSBio-579 to rodents, in models of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Atypical antipsychotics; Clozapine; Dissociation kinetics; Intrinsic activity; Residence time; Schizophrenia","Abbott, A., The drug deadlock (2010) Nat Rev Drug Discov, 468, pp. 158-159; Beaulieu, J.M., Gainetdinov, R.R., Caron, M.G., Akt/GSK3 signaling in the action of psychotropic drugs (2009) Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol, 49, pp. 327-347; Bradford, M., A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding (1976) Anal Biochem, 72, pp. 248-254; Burris, K.D., Molski, T.F., Xu, C., Ryan, E., Tottori, K., Kikuchi, T., Aripiprazole, a novel antipsychotic, is a high-affinity partial agonist at human dopamine D<inf>2</inf> receptors (2002) J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 302, pp. 381-389; Copeland, R.A., Pompliano, D.L., Meek, T.D., Drug-target residence time and its implications for lead optimization (2006) Nat Rev Drug Discov, 9, pp. 730-739; Ginovart, N., Kapur, S., Role of dopamine D(2) receptors for antipsychotic activity (2012) Handb Exp Pharmacol, 212, pp. 27-52; Gomes, T.F., Pompeu, T.E., Rodrigues, D.A., Noël, F., Menegatti, R., Andrade, C.H., Biotransformation of LASSBio-579 and pharmacological evaluation of p-hydroxylated metabolite a N-phenylpiperazine antipsychotic lead compound (2013) Eur J Med Chem, 62, pp. 214-221; Guo, D., Van Drop, E.J.H., Mulder-Krieger, T., Van-Veldhoven, J.P.D., Brussee, J., Ijzerman, A., Dual-point competition association assay: a fast and high-throughput kinetic screening method for assessing ligand-receptor binding kinetics (2013) J Biomol Screen, 18 (3), pp. 309-320; Guo, D., Hillger, J.M., Ijzerman, A.P., Heitman, L.H., Drug-target residence time - a case for G protein-coupled receptors (2014) Med Res Rev, 34 (4), pp. 856-892; Jordan, S., Johnson, J.L., Regardie, K., Chen, R., Koprivica, V., Tadori, Y., Dopamine D<inf>2</inf> receptor partial agonists display differential or contrasting characteristics in membrane and cell-based assays of dopamine D<inf>2</inf> receptor signaling (2007) Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry, 31 (2), pp. 348-356; Kapur, S., Seeman, P., Antipsychotic agents differ in how fast they come off the dopamine D<inf>2</inf> receptors.

Given conceptualization of a continuum of schizotypal traits, people with normal but high levels of schizotypal traits may also exhibit atypical language lateralization. The present study was thus designed to examine language lateralization in the general population as a function of self-rated schizotypal traits. Ninety participants (. M=. 31, F=. 59) completed a lateralized lexical decision task and measures assessing handedness and schizotypy (O-LIFE; Mason, Claridge, & Jackson, 1995). Results indicated that lateralized lexical decision performance was not affected by schizotypy: people with both high and low O-LIFE scores showed a similar right visual field (i.e., left hemisphere) advantage. Hierarchical regression confirmed that when participant gender and handedness were controlled, levels of schizotypal traits did not predict lateralization. Such findings indicate that the reduced language lateralization observed in people with schizophrenia is not evident, even to a lesser degree, in healthy people with high levels of schizotypal traits. These data thus indicate a degree of discontinuity between schizophrenia and schizotypy. Structural and functional imaging investigation is needed to further investigate these suggestive behavioral findings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Asymmetry; Hemisphere; Language; Lateralization; Schizotypy","Baron-Cohen, S., Wheelwright, S., Skinner, R., Martin, J., Clubley, E., The autism spectrum quotient (AQ): Evidence from Asperger syndrome/high-functioning autism, males and females, scientists and mathematicians (2001) Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 3, pp. 5-17; Bourne, V.J., The divided visual field paradigm: Methodological considerations (2006) Laterality, 11 (4), pp. 373-393; Burch, G.S.J., Steel, C., Hemsley, D.R., Oxford-liverpool inventory of feelings and experiences: Reliability in an experimental population (1998) British Journal of Clinical Psychology, 37 (1), pp. 107-108; Castro, A., Pearson, R., Lateralisation of language and emotion in schizotypal personality: Evidence from dichotic listening (2011) Personality and Individual Differences, 51 (6), pp. 726-731; Chapman, L.J., Chapman, J.P., Scales for rating psychotic and psychotic-like experiences as continua (1980) Schizophrenia Bulletin, 6 (3), pp. 477-489; Chiarello, C., Senehi, J., Soulier, M., Viewing conditions and hemisphere asymmetry for the lexical decision (1986) Neuropsychologia, 24 (4), pp. 521-529; Crow, T.J., Is schizophrenia the price Homo sapiens pays for language?

This variance is thought to explain, in part, the experience of voice-hearing. Misattribution can also be context-driven. For example, causal ambiguity can arise when the actions of two or more individuals are coordinated and produce similar effects (e.g., music-making). Experience in such challenging contexts may refine skills of action attribution. Forty participants completed a novel finger-tapping task which parametrically manipulated the proportion of control that 'self' versus 'other' possessed over resulting auditory tones. Results showed that action misattribution peaked in the middle of the self-to-other continuum and was biased towards other. This pattern was related to both high hallucination-proneness and to low musical-experience. Findings suggest not only that causal ambiguity plays a key role in agency but also that action attribution abilities may improve with practice, potentially providing an avenue for remediation of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Action attribution; Action-outcome discordance; Agency; Ambiguity; Hallucination proneness; Joint-action; Misattribution; Music-making; Schizotypy","Adolphs, R., The neurobiology of social cognition (2001) Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 11 (2), pp. 231-239; Aggemaes, A., The experienced reality of hallucinations and other psychological phenomena (1972) Ada Psychiatrica Scandinavica, 48, pp. 220-238; Aleman, A., Nieuwenstein, M.R., Bocker, K.B., de Haan, E.H., Temporal stability of the Launay-Slade Hallucination Scale for high- and low-scoring normal subjects (1999) Psychological Reports, 85, pp. 1101-1104; An, S.K., Kang, J.I., Park, J.Y., Kim, K.R., Lee, S.Y., Lee, E., Attribution bias in ultra-high risk for psychosis and first-episode schizophrenia (2010) Schizophrenia Research, 118 (1-3), pp. 54-61; Ansfield, M., Wegner, D.M., The feeling of doing (1996) The psychology of action: Linking cognition and motivation to behavior, pp. 482-506. , Guilford, New York, P.M.

Abnormal high frequency oscillations (HFO) in the rat NAc have been associated with pharmacological models of schizophrenia, in particular the N-methyl- d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction model. Here, we tested the hypothesis that abnormal HFO are also associated with a neurodevelopmental rat model. Methods: Using prenatal administration of the mitotoxin methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) we obtained the offspring MAM rats. Adult MAM and Sham rats were implanted with electrodes, for local field potential recordings, in the NAc. Results: Spontaneous HFO (spHFO) in MAM rats were characterized by increased power and frequency relative to Sham rats. MK801 dose-dependently increased the power of HFO in both groups. However, the dose-dependent increase in HFO frequency found in Sham rats was occluded in MAM rats. The antipsychotic compound, clozapine reduced the frequency of HFO which was similar in both MAM and Sham rats. Further, HFO were modulated in a similar manner by delta oscillations in both MAM and Sham rats. Conclusion: Together these findings suggest that increased HFO frequency represents an important feature in certain animal models of schizophrenia. These findings support the hypothesis that altered functioning of the NAc is a core feature in animal models of schizophrenia. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Clozapine; High frequency oscillations; MAM rat model; NMDAR antagonists; Schizophrenia","Braff, D.L., Geyer, M.A., Sensorimotor gating and schizophrenia.

The SPAK downstream substrates NKCC<inf>1</inf> and KCC<inf>2</inf> in the central nervous system are important in the interpretation of developmental mental disorders. The present study aimed to clarify the role of SPAK-NKCC<inf>1</inf>/KCC<inf>2</inf> using a rodent schizophrenia-like model. The mouse paradigm of isolation rearing (IR) was employed, as it simulates the sensorimotor gating abnormalities of schizophrenia. SPAK transgenic mice were used and were divided into four groups: social-wild type, social-SPAK-/-, isolation-wild type, and isolation-SPAK-/-. The prepulse inhibition (PPI) test and the novel object recognition test (NORT) were used to measure schizophrenia-associated dysfunctions in gating ability and the novelty recognition, respectively. Finally, the protein expressions of NKCC<inf>1</inf>/KCC<inf>2</inf> in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were detected to determine correlations with the behavioral data. Our results demonstrated that SPAK-null mice had superior PPI and novelty recognition relative to wild type controls, with a concomitant increase in KCC<inf>2</inf> in the prefrontal cortex. IR disrupted PPI and NORT performances with an associated increase in KCC<inf>2</inf>. Furthermore, rearing environment and gene manipulation had mutually interactive effects, as the IR-induced effects on PPI and NORT were reversed by SPAK knockout, and the increase in KCC<inf>2</inf> and the decreased in the NKCC<inf>1</inf>/KCC<inf>2</inf> ratio in the prefrontal cortex induced by SPAK knockout were reversed by IR. Our data supported the gene-environment hypothesis and demonstrated the potential value of SPAK manipulation in future schizophrenia studies. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","NKCC<inf>1</inf>/KCC<inf>2</inf>; Novelty recognition;

However, few studies have investigated the epidemiology and progression time from transient to permanent psychiatric disorders for AIPD and SIPD patients. Methods: We utilized the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to investigate the incidence and prevalence of AIPD and SIPD in Taiwan and determined the timing of AIPD or SIPD followed by the development of persistent psychotic conditions. Results: The average incidence and prevalence were 1.97 and 2.94 per 100,000. person-years for AIPD, 3.09 and 5.67 per 100,000. person-years for SIPD in Taiwan. Moreover, 10.9% to 24.3% of subjects with either AIPD or SIPD had a change in diagnosis to either schizophrenia or affective disorder, and ~. 50% of patients had a psychotic or affective transformation in their first year after AIPD and SIPD diagnoses. The mean progression time of psychotic or affective transformation was 1.9 to 2.7. years. Conclusions: SIP is a predictive factor for persistent psychotic and affective transformation, and a three-year follow-up may be an optimal clinical practice to prevent psychotic or affective transformation in 60% of patients. © 2014.","Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder; National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD); Substance-induced psychosis; Substance-induced psychotic disorder","Akiyama, K., Longitudinal clinical course following pharmacological treatment of methamphetamine psychosis which persists after long-term abstinence (2006) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1074, pp. 125-134; Alaja, R., Seppa, K., Sillanaukee, P., Tienari, P., Huyse, F.J., Herzog, T., Physical and mental comorbidity of substance use disorders in psychiatric consultations.

Here we show that human genetic research has contributed to such understanding. While candidate gene studies have partially confirmed animal-based hypotheses, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided evidence for novel memory-related genes. In this article we review candidate gene and GWAS findings related to working memory, episodic memory and emotional memory in healthy cohorts. These memory types are disturbed in neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Studies on the genetic underpinnings of memory functions in healthy cohorts are important for a better understanding of physiological processes and for the identification of novel drug targets related to such conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Baddeley, A., Working memory (1992) Science, 255, pp. 556-559; Shah, P., Miyake, A., Models of working memory: mechanisms of active maintenance and executive control (1999) Models of Working Memory: An Introduction, pp. 1-27. , Cambridge University Press, A.

Individuals with schizophrenia consistently demonstrate deficits in this ability leading to sensory overload and cognitive fragmentation. This dysfunction has also been found in schizotypy, which is defined as a manifestation of nonclinical symptoms qualitatively similar to those found in schizophrenia. In the present study, auditory sensory gating was assessed in healthy individuals by testing the attenuation of the P50 event-related potential. The degree of suppression was then correlated with schizotypy by using the O-LIFE questionnaire. Relative to the low-scoring individuals, P50 suppression was significantly reduced in those with high levels of schizotypy. Furthermore, the degree of deficit in P50 gating correlated with both cognitive disorganisation and impulsive nonconformity dimensions of schizotypy. These results suggest that schizotypal individuals may have early sensory gating deficits similar to schizophrenia patients, especially if they display a disorganised or impulsive profile. As they do not exhibit overt psychotic symptoms, it is likely that such deficits represent an underlying core cognitive dysfunction within the schizophrenia spectrum. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Disorganisation; ERPs; Impulsivity; P50; Schizotypy; Sensory gating","Adler, L.E., Oliney, A., Waldo, M., Harris, J.G., Griffith, J., Stevens, K., Schizophrenia, sensory gating, and nicotinic receptors (1998) Schizophrenia Bulletin, 24, pp. 189-202; Bramon, E., Rabe-Hesketh, S., Sham, P., Murray, R.M., Frangou, S., Meta-analysis of the P300 and P50 waveforms in schizophrenia (2004) Schizophrenia Research, 70, pp. 315-329; Burch, G.S., Steel, C., Hemsley, D.R., Oxford-liverpool inventory of feelings and experiences: Reliability in an experimental population (1998) British Journal of Clinical Psychology, 37 (1), pp. 107-108; Cadenhead, K.S., Light, G.A., Geyer, M.A., Braff, D.L., Sensory gating deficits assessed by the P50 event-related potential in subjects with schizotypal personality disorder (2000) American Journal of Psychiatry, 157, pp. 55-59; Cadenhead, K.S., Light, G.A., Geyer, M.A., McDowell, J.E., Braff, D.L., Neurobiological measures of schizotypal personality disorder: Defining an inhibitory endophenotype?

The prepared hybrid silica monoliths consisted of a uniform, porous, and continuous silica monolithic network. The structure of the aminopropyl hybrid silica monolith was more compact than the structure of the cyanopropyl hybrid silica monolith. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of the hybrid silica monoliths displayed readily identifiable peaks, characteristic of the cyanopropyl and aminopropyl groups. Compared with the aminopropyl hybrid silica phase, the cyanopropyl hybrid silica phase exhibited higher binding capacity for most of the target drugs. The developed method afforded adequate linearity at concentrations ranging from the lower limit of quantification (0.05-1.00 ng mL-1) to the upper limit of quantification (40-10,500 ng mL-1); the coefficients of determination (r2) were higher than 0.9955. The precision of the method presented coefficients of variation (CV) lower than 14%; the relative standard error (RSE) of the accuracy ranged from -12% to 14%. The developed method allowed for simultaneous analysis of five antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, clozapine, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine) in combination with seven antidepressants (mirtazapine, paroxetine, citalopram, sertraline, imipramine, clomipramine, fluoxetine), two anticonvulsants (carbamazepine and lamotrigine), and two anxiolytics (diazepam and clonazepam) in plasma samples from schizophrenic patients, which should be valuable for therapeutic drug monitoring purposes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Recent research has shown that visual, auditory, or audiovisual stimuli can elicit transient pupil dilation, and the timing and size of the evoked responses are systematically modulated by stimulus salience. Moreover, weak microstimulation of the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure involved in eye movements and attention, evokes similar transient pupil dilation, suggesting that the SC coordinates the orienting response which includes transient pupil dilation. Projections from the SC to the pupil control circuitry provide a novel neural substrate underlying pupil modulation by various cognitive processes. © 2015.",,"Loewenfeld, I.E., (1999) The Pupil: Anatomy, Physiology, and Clinical Applications, , Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston; Campbell, F.W., Gregory, A.H., Effect of size of pupil on visual acuity (1960) Nature, 187, pp. 1121-1123; Laughlin, S.B., Retinal information capacity and the function of the pupil (1992) Ophthalmic Physiol Opt, 12, pp. 161-164; Beatty, J., Task-evoked pupillary responses, processing load, and the structure of processing resources (1982) Psychol Bull, 91, pp. 276-292; de Gee, J.W., Knapen, T., Donner, T.H., Decision-related pupil dilation reflects upcoming choice and individual bias (2014) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 111, pp. E618-E625; Einhauser, W., Stout, J., Koch, C., Carter, O., Pupil dilation reflects perceptual selection and predicts subsequent stability in perceptual rivalry (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 105, pp. 1704-1709; Eldar, E., Cohen, J.D., Niv, Y., The effects of neural gain on attention and learning (2013) Nat Neurosci, 16, pp. 1146-1153; Goldinger, S.D., Papesh, M.H., Pupil dilation reflects the creation and retrieval of memories (2012) Curr Dir Psychol Sci, 21, pp. 90-95; Naber, M., Frassle, S., Rutishauser, U., Einhauser, W., Pupil size signals novelty and predicts later retrieval success for declarative memories of natural scenes (2013) J Vis, 13, pp. 1-20; Nassar, M.R., Rumsey, K.M., Wilson, R.C., Parikh, K., Heasly, B., Gold, J.I., Rational regulation of learning dynamics by pupil-linked arousal systems (2012) Nat Neurosci, 15, pp. 1040-1046; Privitera, C.M., Renninger, L.W., Carney, T., Klein, S., Aguilar, M., Pupil dilation during visual target detection (2010) J Vis, 10, pp. 1-14. , 3; Wierda, S.M., van Rijn, H., Taatgen, N.A., Martens, S., Pupil dilation deconvolution reveals the dynamics of attention at high temporal resolution (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 109, pp. 8456-8460; Lynn, R., (1966) Attention, arousal and the orientation reaction, , Pergamon Press, Oxford, UK; Sokolov, E.N., Higher nervous functions; the orienting reflex (1963) Annu Rev Physiol, 25, pp. 545-580; Carrasco, M., Visual attention: the past 25 years (2011) Vis Res, 51, pp. 1484-1525; Kowler, E., Eye movements: the past 25 years (2011) Vis Res, 51, pp. 1457-1483; Netser, S., Ohayon, S., Gutfreund, Y., Multiple manifestations of microstimulation in the optic tectum: eye movements, pupil dilations, and sensory priming (2010) J Neurophysiol, 104, pp. 108-118; Wang, C.A., Boehnke, S.E., Itti, L., Munoz, D.P., Transient pupil response is modulated by contrast-based saliency (2014) J Neurosci, 34, pp. 408-417; Wang, C.A., Munoz, D.P., Modulation of stimulus contrast on the human pupil orienting response (2014) Eur J Neurosci, 40, pp. 2822-2832; Nieuwenhuis, S., De Geus, E.J., Aston-Jones, G., The anatomical and functional relationship between the P3 and autonomic components of the orienting response (2011) Psychophysiology, 48, pp. 162-175; Gandhi, N.J., Katnani, H.A., Motor functions of the superior colliculus (2011) Annu Rev Neurosci, 34, pp. 205-231; Krauzlis, R.J., Lovejoy, L.P., Zenon, A., Superior colliculus and visual spatial attention (2013) Annu Rev Neurosci, 36, pp. 165-182; Netser, S., Dutta, A., Gutfreund, Y., Ongoing activity in the optic tectum is correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with the pupil dilation response (2014) J Neurophysiol, 111, pp. 918-929; Wang, C.A., Boehnke, S.E., White, B.J., Munoz, D.P., Microstimulation of the monkey superior colliculus induces pupil dilation without evoking saccades (2012) J Neurosci, 32, pp. 3629-3636; Szabadi, E., Modulation of physiological reflexes by pain: role of the locus coeruleus (2012) Front Integr Neurosci, 6, p. 94; Gamlin, P.D., The pretectum: connections and oculomotor-related roles (2006) Prog Brain Res, 151, pp. 379-405; Sara, S.J., Bouret, S., Orienting and reorienting: the locus coeruleus mediates cognition through arousal (2012) Neuron, 76, pp. 130-141; Rajkowski, J., Kubiak, P., Aston-Jones, G., Correlations between locus coeruleus (LC) neural activity, pupil diameter and behavior in monkey support a role of LC in attention (1993) Soc Neurosci Abstr, 19, p. 974; Hou, R.H., Freeman, C., Langley, R.W., Szabadi, E., Bradshaw, C.M., Does modafinil activate the locus coeruleus in man?

Hence the factor ""age"" may be taken as strategic tool to analyse specific scientific hypotheses. Additionally, this finding also needs to be addressed in rather pragmatically performed breeding protocols of model organisms, since otherwise artefacts may challenge the validity of the results.Our study was performed to investigate influences of advanced age of mouse dams (30 vs. 16. weeks) on maternal- and offspring behaviour. Adult offspring of both sexes was analysed in a test battery comprising paradigms for exploration, anxiety and depressive-like behaviours. Final blood sampling was conducted for stressphysiological analysis.Interestingly, advanced age of the mothers was associated with increased nest-building quality while maternal activity was unaffected. Moreover ""maternal (mice) age"" (MA) affected emotionality in the offspring, which became apparent in the dark-light box and the social recognition paradigm.These findings not only emphasize MA to model a potent risk factor with regard to emotional stability, but also underscore the vast necessity to include information about breeding protocols into the methods section of any animal study. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.","Age; Emotionality; Maternal environment; Mice; Sociality","Vierck, E., Silverman, J.M., Brief report: phenotypic differences and their relationship to paternal age and gender in autism spectrum disorder (2014) J.

Here, we propose that different trajectories require different approaches to optimise outcomes and prevent disability for individuals with psychoses. We propose that for functions that are preserved in early psychosis, targeted approaches focusing on strengths and factors conferring resilience are needed. Alternatively, for deficits apparent from illness onset, other approaches such as cognitive adaptation may be necessary. Based on the limited evidence to date, this also implies that treatments aiming to preserve functions must be instigated at the earliest prodromal stage of psychosis. Below, we examine the evidence for these approaches as they might apply to these notions and highlight recent studies of particular interest. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"McGorry, P.D., Issues for DSM-V: clinical staging: a heuristic pathway to valid nosology and safer, more effective treatment in psychiatry (2007) Am J Psychiatry, 164, pp. 859-860; McGorry, P.D., Clinical staging: a heuristic model for psychiatry and youth mental health (2007) Med J Aust, 187 (7), pp. S40-S42; Birchwood, M., Todd, P., Jackson, C., Early intervention in psychosis.

These sex differences likely represent underlying differences in connectivity and/or the balance of neuronal excitability within the mPFC. Recently, we demonstrated that signaling via the metabotropic γ-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA<inf>B</inf>R) and G protein-gated inwardly-rectifying K+ (GIRK/Kir3) channels modulates the excitability of the key output neurons of the mPFC, the layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons. Here, we report a sex difference in the GABA<inf>B</inf>R-GIRK signaling pathway in these neurons. Specifically, GABA<inf>B</inf>R-dependent GIRK currents recorded in the prelimbic region of the mPFC were larger in adolescent male mice than in female counterparts. Interestingly, this sex difference was not observed in layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons of the adjacent infralimbic cortex, nor was it seen in young adult mice. The sex difference in GABA<inf>B</inf>R-GIRK signaling is not attributable to different expression levels of signaling pathway components, but rather to a phosphorylation-dependent trafficking mechanism. Thus, sex differences related to some diseases associated with altered mPFC function may be explained in part by sex differences in GIRK-dependent signaling in mPFC pyramidal neurons. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

PMZ is used for the control of mania and schizophrenia. The drug interacts with gelatin similar to the interaction of surfactants and polymers. The plots of specific conductivity versus concentration of the drug were nonlinear with three different linear regions with two clear breaks. The first break point, i.e., critical aggregation concentration (cac), appeared well below the typical critical micelle concentration (cmc). The second break point is considered as polymer saturation point (psp) that is akin to cmc. The cac value decreases on increasing the gelatin concentration, whereas the psp value increases for all fixed concentrations (%w/v) of gelatin which is a clear signal of the interaction of the drug with gelatin. As inorganic salts increase the ionic strength, the solubility of amphiphile (drug) is lowered by ionic screening effects, ensuing in a greater tendency to aggregates at lower concentration. As a result, both the cac and psp/cmc values decrease. By the addition of urea an increase in the surface charge of the micelles was observed followed by halt of the aggregation of the drug hence both the cac and psp/cmc values increase. Free energies of aggregation (ΔG<inf>agg</inf>), micellization (ΔG<inf>mic</inf>), polymer saturation (‡G<inf>psp</inf>) and transfer (ΔG<inf>t</inf>) were also evaluated. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas there is compelling evidence demonstrating that NT facilitates cognitive processes, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms have not been fully determined. Because the dentate gyrus expresses high densities of NT and NT receptors, we examined the effects of NT on the synaptic transmission at the synapse formed between the perforant path (PP) and granule cells (GC) in the rats. Our results demonstrate that NT persistently increased the amplitude of the AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs at the PP-GC synapse. NT-induced increases in AMPA EPSCs were mediated by presynaptic NTS1 receptors. NT reduced the coefficient of variation and paired-pulse ratio of AMPA EPSCs suggesting that NT facilitates presynaptic glutamate release. NT increased the release probability and the number of readily releasable vesicles with no effects on the rate of recovery from vesicle depletion. NT-mediated augmentation of glutamate release required the influx of Ca2+ via L-type Ca2+ channels and the functions of calmodulin and myosin light chain kinase. Our results provide a cellular and molecular mechanism to explain the roles of NT in the hippocampus. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We focused on MAPT, APP, NCSTN and BACE1 as the basis to build and compare blood classifiers for AD. Methods: We used a combined model to build disease classifiers, using measures of blood pressure and serum glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well as RT-PCR expression levels of APP, NCSTN and BACE1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from an independent cohort of 36 individuals of cognitively-normal controls, AD and other neuropathologies. Also, a set of genes was carefully selected by molecular interactions with MAPT, APP, NCSTN and BACE1 to test an expression-based classifier in a public microarray dataset of 40 samples (AD and controls). A series of discriminant analyses and classification and regression trees (C&RTs) were used to perform classification tasks. Results: Using C&RTs, the combined model showed potential to differentially diagnose AD with up to 94.4% accuracy and 100% specificity for our independent sample. Furthermore, a subset of 16 genes showed the best diagnostic potential using a minimum number of expression variables, correctly classifying up to 100% of samples in the public dataset. Conclusions: Our unique method of variable selection proves that even elements showing no significant differences between controls and AD, but that have somehow been linked to AD or AD-related elements, still hold a potential to be used in its diagnosis. Sample size and inherent methodological limitations of this study need to be kept in mind. Our classifiers require careful further testing in larger cohorts. Nonetheless, we believe these results provide evidence for the utility of our innovative method, which contributes a different approach to generate promising diagnostic tools for neuropsychiatric disorders. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Alzheimer[U+05F3]s disease; Classifiers; Diagnosis; Gene expression","http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/, EMBL-EBIBallatore, C., Lee, V.M., Trojanowski, J.Q., Tau-mediated neurodegeneration in Alzheimer[U+05F3]s disease and related disorders (2007) Nat.

However, no studies employed a methodology specifically designed to assess cerebellar morphology. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between NSS levels and abnormalities of the human cerebellum in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia and healthy individuals using an exclusive cerebellar atlas. Methods: A group of 26 patients with recent-onset schizophrenia and 26 healthy controls were included. All participants underwent a high-resolution T1-weighted MRI scan on a 3 Tesla scanner. We used a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach utilizing the Spatially Unbiased Infratentorial (SUIT) toolbox to provide an optimized and fine-grained exploration of cerebellar structural alterations associated with NSS. Results: Compared with healthy controls, patients had significantly smaller cerebellar volumes for both hemispheres. In the patients' group, we identified a significant negative correlation between NSS levels and gray matter volume in the left lobule VI and the right lobule VIIa, corrected for multiple comparisons. Further, NSS performance was significantly associated with white matter volume in the left midbrain and corpus medullare and the right lobule VIIa. In contrast, no significant associations between NSS scores and cerebellar subregions in healthy subjects arose. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the benefits of SUIT when investigating cerebellar correlates of NSS. These results support the view that distinct parts of sensorimotor and cognitive cerebellum play an important role in the pathogenesis of NSS in schizophrenia. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Cerebellum; NSS; Schizophrenia; SUIT","Andreasen, N.C., (1983) The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), , University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa; Andreasen, N.C., (1984) The Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), , University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa; Andreasen, N.C., Pierson, R., The role of the cerebellum in schizophrenia (2008) Biol Psychiatry, 64, pp. 81-88; Andreasen, N.C., Paradiso, S., O'Leary, D.S., ""Cognitive dysmetria"" as an integrative theory of schizophrenia: a dysfunction in cortical-subcortical-cerebellar circuitry?

However, the recent failure of Phase III clinical trials dealt a huge blow to the scientific community and the aftershock of the setback in mGluR2/3 research can be felt everywhere from grant support and laboratory studies to paper publication. An immediate question raised is whether mGluR2/3 is still a promising therapeutic target for schizophrenia. Answering this question is not easy, but apparently a new strategy is needed. This article provides a focused review of literature on the study of mGluR2/3 agonists, especially on mGluR2/3 agonists' mechanism of action and efficacy in both normal conditions and animal models of SZ, as well as clinical studies in human patients with the disease. We argue that the cellular and molecular actions of mGluR2/3 agonists, the distinct roles between mGluR2 and mGluR3, as well as their effects on different stages of the disease and different subpopulations of patients, remain incompletely studied. Until the mechanisms associated with mGluR2/3 are clearly elucidated and all treatment options are tested, it would be a great mistake to terminate the study of mGluR2/3 as a therapeutic target for schizophrenia. This review will thus shed light on the comprehensive features of the translational potential mGluR2/3 agonists as well as the need for further research into the more selective activation of mGluR2. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Antipsychotics;

We evaluated the effect of EE on sensorimotor gating (measured by prepulse inhibition, PPI), or on sensorimotor gating deficit induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801) in both sexes of Wistar rats. Rats were injected with MK-801 (1. mg/kg) on postnatal days (P) 6-10. EE was provided from birth up to the time of experiments on P28-30 or P58-60. PPI data were collected at three prepulse intensities and then averaged to yield global PPI.MK-801 treatment reduced PPI significantly in both sexes. While EE per se had no significant effect on PPI, it restored MK-801-induced PPI deficit only in male rats. An extended period of EE did not influence PPI deficit in female rats. Our results indicate that postnatal exposure to MK-801 may exert long-lasting effects on neuronal circuits underlying sensorimotor gating. Sex-specific modulation of such effects by EE suggests sexually dimorphic mechanisms are involved. © 2015 IBRO.","NMDA receptor antagonist; Prepulse inhibition; Rat; Schizophrenia","Adell, A., Jiménez-Sánchez, L., López-Gil, X., Romón, T., Is the acute NMDA receptor hypofunction a valid model of schizophrenia?

Design: Feasibility/Acceptability Study and Quasi-Experimental Trial. Method: Sixteen outpatients with schizophrenia received treatment as usual and they all completed an 8-week exergame intervention using Microsoft Kinect® (20min sessions, biweekly). Participants completed pre and post treatment assessments regarding functional mobility (Timed Up and Go Test), functional fitness performance (Senior Fitness Test), motor neurological soft signs (Brief Motor Scale), hand grip strength (digital dynamometer), static balance (force plate), speed of processing (Trail Making Test), schizophrenia-related symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) and functioning (Personal and Social Performance Scale). The EG group completed an acceptability questionnaire after the intervention. Results: Attrition rate was 18.75% and 69.23% of the participants completed the intervention within the proposed schedule. Baseline clinical traits were not related to game performance indicators. Over 90% of the participants rated the intervention as satisfactory and interactive. Most participants (76.9%) agreed that this intervention promotes healthier lifestyles and is an acceptable alternative to perform physical activity. Repeated-measures MANOVA analyses found no significant multivariate effects for combined outcomes. Conclusion: This study established the feasibility and acceptability of an exergame intervention for outpatients with schizophrenia. The intervention proved to be an appealing alternative to physical activity. Future trials should include larger sample sizes, explore patients' adherence to home-based exergames and consider greater intervention dosage (length, session duration, and/or frequency) in order to achieve potential effects. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Exergames;

We investigated the effect of a 'two hit' combination of two factors implicated in schizophrenia development, reelin deficiency and stress, on cognitive behaviours in mice. Male and female heterozygous reelin mice (HRM) and wild-type (WT) controls received the stress hormone, corticosterone (CORT), during early adulthood to simulate chronic stress. The Y-maze, novel object recognition task (NORT), social interaction task and prepulse inhibition (PPI) were used to assess short-term spatial memory, visual non-spatial memory, social recognition memory and sensory gating, respectively. Reelin protein expression was measured in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus.CORT induced spatial memory deficits in male and female HRM but not in WT controls suggesting increased vulnerability of HRM to the effects of stress on cognition. By contrast, CORT disrupted PPI only in male WT mice, but not in male HRM, suggesting a protective role of reelin deficiency against effects of stress on PPI. Male HRM performed worse in the social recognition memory task compared to wild-type controls, irrespective of CORT treatment. No differences were detected in the NORT. Reelin protein expression was increased in the PFC of female CORT-treated HRM but there were no group differences in the hippocampus. Overall, these findings extend our understanding of the role of reelin-stress interactions in schizophrenia. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Corticosterone; Prepulse inhibition; Reelin; Schizophrenia; Social interaction;

In the present study, we evaluated the cognitive efficacy of tandospirone, given alone or in combination with the antipsychotic blonanserin, risperidone or haloperidol, on executive function in marmosets using the object retrieval with detour (ORD) task. Treatment with tandospirone alone at 20 and 40mg/kg increased the number of correct responses in the difficult trial, while risperidone (0.3mg/kg) and haloperidol (0.3mg/kg) decreased the number of correct responses in this trial. On the other hand, blonanserin (0.1-0.3mg/kg), an atypical antipsychotic highly selective for dopamine D<inf>2</inf>/D<inf>3</inf> and serotonin 5-HT<inf>2A</inf> receptors, did not affect the number of correct responses in both the easy and difficult trials. Co-treatment with tandospirone (20mg/kg) and risperidone (0.1-0.3mg/kg) or haloperidol (0.1-0.3mg/kg) did not improve animals' performance in the difficult trial. However, co-treatment with tandospirone and blonanserin (0.1-0.3mg/kg) increased the number of correct responses in the difficult trial. In addition, treatment with the dopamine D<inf>1</inf> receptor agonist SKF-81297 at 1mg/kg increased marmosets correct responses in the difficult trial. These results suggest that tandospirone is a promising candidate for the treatment of cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia and that adjunctive treatment with tandospirone and blonanserin is more appropriate for cognitive deficits than combination therapy with tandospirone and risperidone or haloperidol. The results of this study also indicate that the putative mechanism of action of tandospirone might be related to enhancement of dopamine neurotransmission via activation of the 5-HT<inf>1A</inf> receptor. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Antipsychotic;

The insular cortex (IC) plays an important role in integrating emotion processing with interoception and has been implicated recently in the pathophysiology of adult and adolescent MDD. However, no studies have yet specifically examined the IC in adolescent MDD during processing of faces in the sad-happy continuum. Thus, the aim of the present study is to investigate the IC during sad and happy face processing in adolescents with MDD compared to healthy controls (HCL). Methods Thirty-one adolescents (22 female) with MDD and 36 (23 female) HCL underwent a well-validated emotional processing fMRI paradigm that included sad and happy face stimuli. Results The MDD group showed significantly less differential activation of the anterior/middle insular cortex (AMIC) in response to sad versus happy faces compared to the HCL group. AMIC also showed greater functional connectivity with right fusiform gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and right amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus in the MDD compared to HCL group. Moreover, differential activation to sad and happy faces in AMIC correlated negatively with depression severity within the MDD group. Limitations Small age-range and cross-sectional nature precluded assessment of development of the AMIC in adolescent depression. Conclusions Given the role of the IC in integrating bodily stimuli with conscious cognitive and emotional processes, our findings of aberrant AMIC function in adolescent MDD provide a neuroscientific rationale for targeting the AMIC in the development of new treatment modalities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

They have been used in the treatment of serious mental and emotional symptoms including bipolar disorder, organic psychoses, psychotic depression and schizophrenia. However, these drugs cause serious side effects such as akathisia, hyperprolactinaemia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. In this work we investigated the molecular recognition of two typical phenothiazine compounds, phenosafranin and safranin O by the most pivotal heme protein hemoglobin using steady state and time-resolved fluorescence, extrinsic 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) fluorescent probe, circular dichroism (CD) along with computational modeling. Results show phenothiazines complex with protein via formation of adducts at 298 K with moderate strengths of 3.555 × 104 M-1 and 2.567 × 104 M-1 for the hemoglobin-phenosafranin and hemoglobin-safranin O, respectively. We also found phenothiazines were effectors at the protein allosteric site, which affects the allosteric equilibrium. Further, time-resolved fluorescence and hydrophobic ANS experiments showed the static mechanism is dominated for the shrinkage in the fluorescence intensity of β-37 Trp residue at the α<inf>1</inf>β<inf>2</inf> interface. The stoichiometric proportion of the protein-drug adduct is 1:1, as derived from Job's plot. Several crucial noncovalent bonds, including hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking and hydrophobic interactions played a major role in stabilizing the noncovalent conjugates. Based on three-dimensional fluorescence, we concluded that the conformation of hemoglobin is partially destabilized after recognition with phenothiazines. These alterations were confirmed by far-UV CD spectra that showed the α-helix of protein decreased from 78.3% in free hemoglobin to 62.8% and 64.8% in hemoglobin-phenosafranin and hemoglobin-safranin O, respectively. Computer-aided molecular docking was consistent, indicating that both phenothiazines are situated within the pocket composed of α<inf>1</inf> and β<inf>2</inf> subunits. Affinity of hemoglobin to phenosafranin is superior compared with safranin O. This difference may be explained by the methyl group substituent on A- and C-rings, and by the different molecular volume between phenosafranin and safranin O. Our data provides further explanation of the overall pharmacokinetics of phenothiazines and sheds light on the allosteric regulation of heme proteins. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Both serotonin-2A (5-HT<inf>2A</inf>) and -2C (5-HT<inf>2C</inf>) receptors are known to be important in neuropsychiatric drug action and are distributed throughout the mPFC. However, their interactive role in serotonergic cortical regulation is poorly understood. While the main signal transduction mechanism for both receptors is stimulation of phosphoinositide production, they can have opposite effects downstream. 5-HT<inf>2A</inf> versus 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> receptor activation oppositely regulates behavior and can oppositely affect neurochemical release within the mPFC. These distinct receptor effects could be caused by their differential cellular distribution within the cortex and/or other areas. It is known that both receptors are located on GABAergic and pyramidal cells within the mPFC, but it is not clear whether they are expressed on the same or different cells. The present work employed immunofluorescence with confocal microscopy to examine this in layers V-VI of the prelimbic mPFC. The majority of GABA cells in the deep prelimbic mPFC expressed 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> receptor immunoreactivity. Furthermore, most cells expressing 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> receptor immunoreactivity notably co-expressed 5-HT<inf>2A</inf> receptors. However, 27% of 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> receptor immunoreactive cells were not GABAergic, indicating that a population of prelimbic pyramidal projection cells could express the 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> receptor. Indeed, some cells with 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> and 5-HT<inf>2A</inf> receptor co-labeling had a pyramidal shape and were expressed in the typical layered fashion of pyramidal cells. This indirectly demonstrates that 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> and 5-HT<inf>2A</inf> receptors may be commonly co-expressed on GABAergic cells within the deep layers of the prelimbic mPFC and perhaps co-localized on a small population of local pyramidal projection cells. Thus a complex interplay of cortical 5-HT<inf>2A</inf> and 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> receptor mechanisms exists, which if altered, could modulate efferent brain systems implicated in mental illness. © 2015 IBRO.","5-HT;

Neurobiological studies have led to the hypothesis that a deficit in dopamine transmission through D1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with WM impairment in schizophrenia. However, empirical approaches that aim to clarify the nature of the impairment and its underlying mechanism are difficult to enact, especially in unmedicated patients. By contrast, computational approaches using biologically plausible models have formed a powerful theoretical framework for the study of WM impairment in schizophrenia. This article attempts to directly connect neurobiological findings to the neuropsychological behaviors present in patients with schizophrenia. Using a biologically plausible prefrontal cortical circuit model, we simulated sustained activity during a simultaneous, multi-target WM task. We subsequently analyzed how dopaminergic modulation via D1 receptor activation alters the capacity and precision of WM and investigated the underlying mechanism. Hypodopaminergic modulation resulted in imprecision and a reduced capacity in WM primarily due to decreased N-methyl-. d-aspartate (NMDA) conductance. Increasing NMDA conductance ameliorated both impairments. These results account for the mechanism that underlies WM impairments in schizophrenia and provide a theoretical basis for combination therapy with antipsychotic drugs and drugs that enhance NMDA receptor function, which is expected to be effective for the treatment of WM impairments in these patients. © 2015 IBRO.","Computational;

The biological mechanisms that lead to schizophrenia may be related to the genetic background of patients. Thus, a genetic perspective may help to unravel the molecular pathways disrupted in schizophrenia. Methods: In the present work, we used a molecular pathway analysis to identify the molecular pathways associated with schizophrenia. We collected data of genetic loci previously associated with schizophrenia, identified the genes located in those positions and created the metabolic pathways that are related to those genes' products. These pathways were tested for enrichment (a number of SNPs associated with the phenotype significantly higher than expected by chance) in a sample of schizophrenic patients and controls (4486 and 4477, respectively). Results: The molecular pathway that resulted from the identification of all the genes located in the loci previously found to be associated with schizophrenia was found to be enriched, as expected (permutated p(106)=9.9999e-06).We found 60 SNPs amongst 30 different genes with a strong association with schizophrenia. The genes are related to the pathways related to neurodevelopment, apoptosis, vesicle traffic, immune response and MAPK cascade. Conclusions: The pathway related to the toll-like receptor family seemed to play a central role in the modulation/connection of various pathways whose disruption leads to schizophrenia. This pathway is related to the innate immune system, further stressing the role of immunological-related events in increasing the risk to schizophrenia. © 2014.","Pathway analysis; Schizophrenia; TLR; Toll-like receptors","Agim, Z.S., Esendal, M., Briollais, L., Uyan, O., Meschian, M., Martinez, L.A., Discovery, validation and characterization of Erbb4 and Nrg1 haplotypes using data from three genome-wide association studies of schizophrenia (2013) PLoS One, 8, p. e53042; Allen, N.C., Bagade, S., McQueen, M.B., Ioannidis, J.P., Kavvoura, F.K., Khoury, M.J., Systematic meta-analyses and field synopsis of genetic association studies in schizophrenia: the SzGene database (2008) Nat Genet, 40, pp. 827-834; Arnold, S.E., Talbot, K., Hahn, C.G., Neurodevelopment, neuroplasticity, and new genes for schizophrenia (2005) Prog Brain Res, 147, pp. 319-345; Beers, M.H., B.R., Psychiatric emergencies (2004) The Merck manual of diagnosis and therapy, , Merck Research Laboratories, Whitehouse Station, NJ, M.

Carbonyl stress protection is achieved by the glyoxalase system consisting of two enzymes, glyoxalase 1 and 2, which in humans are encoded by the genes GLO1 and HAGH, respectively. Glyoxalase 1 and 2 catalyze the detoxification of reactive alpha-oxoaldehydes such as glyoxal and methylglyoxal, which are particularly damaging components of carbonyl stress. Here, we investigated the role of the glyoxalase system in schizophrenia by performing association analyses of common genetic variants (. n=. 12) in GLO1 and HAGH in a Japanese sample consisting of 2012 schizophrenia patients and 2170 healthy controls. We detected a nominally significant association with schizophrenia (. p=. 0.020) of rs11859266, a SNP in the intronic region of HAGH. However, rs11859266 did not survive multiple testing (empirical p=. 0.091). The variants in HAGH, rs11859266 and rs3743852, showed significant associations with schizophrenia in males at allelic and genotype levels, which remained persistent after multiple testing with the exception of rs3743852 for the genotype model. We further measured the mRNA expression of both genes in postmortem brain, but did not detect any changes in transcript expression levels between case and control samples or in sex-specific comparisons. Therefore, our findings suggest that an explanation of elevated carbonyl stress in a substantial part (reported as ~. 20%) of patients with schizophrenia will require the examination of a much larger cohort to detect risk alleles with weak effect size and/or other risk factors. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Association study; Carbonyl stress; GLO1; HAGH (GLO2); Schizophrenia","Arai, M., Yuzawa, H., Nohara, I., Ohnishi, T., Obata, N., Iwayama, Y., Enhanced carbonyl stress in a subpopulation of schizophrenia (2010) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 67, pp. 589-597; Balan, S., Yamada, K., Hattori, E., Iwayama, Y., Toyota, T., Ohnishi, T., Population-specific haplotype association of the postsynaptic density gene DLG4 with schizophrenia, in family-based association studies (2013) PLoS One, 8, p. e70302; Balan, S., Iwayama, Y., Yamada, K., Toyota, T., Ohnishi, T., Toyoshima, M., Sequencing and expression analyses of the synaptic lipid raft adapter gene PAG1 in schizophrenia (2014) J Neural Transm, pp. 1-9; Bierhaus, A., Hofmann, M.A., Ziegler, R., Nawroth, P.P., AGEs and their interaction with AGE-receptors in vascular disease and diabetes mellitus I.

However, their role in specific psychiatric diseases remains poorly understood. In addition, epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, which affect the expression of both microRNAs and coding genes, are critical for our understanding of molecular mechanisms in schizophrenia.Using clinical, imaging, genetic, and epigenetic data of 103 patients with schizophrenia and 111 healthy controls of the Mind Clinical Imaging Consortium (MCIC) study of schizophrenia, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis to identify markers for schizophrenia-associated intermediate phenotypes. Genes were ranked based on the correlation between DNA methylation patterns and each phenotype, and then searched for enrichment in 221 predicted microRNA target gene sets.We found the predicted hsa-miR-219a-5p target gene set to be significantly enriched for genes (EPHA4, PKNOX1, ESR1, among others) whose methylation status is correlated with hippocampal volume independent of disease status. Our results were strengthened by significant associations between hsa-miR-219a-5p target gene methylation patterns and hippocampus-related neuropsychological variables. IPA pathway analysis of the respective predicted hsa-miR-219a-5p target genes revealed associated network functions in behavior and developmental disorders.Altered methylation patterns of predicted hsa-miR-219a-5p target genes are associated with a structural aberration of the brain that has been proposed as a possible biomarker for schizophrenia. The (dys)regulation of microRNA target genes by epigenetic mechanisms may confer additional risk for developing psychiatric symptoms. Further study is needed to understand possible interactions between microRNAs and epigenetic changes and their impact on risk for brain-based disorders such as schizophrenia. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","DNA methylation; GSEA; Intermediate phenotype; MicroRNA targets; Schizophrenia","Amin, Z., Canli, T., Epperson, C.N., Effect of estrogen-serotonin interactions on mood and cognition (2005) Behav Cogn Neurosci Rev, 4, pp. 43-58; Antonova, E., Sharma, T., Morris, R., Kumari, V., The relationship between brain structure and neurocognition in schizophrenia: a selective review (2004) Schizophr Res, 70, pp. 117-145; Axmacher, N., Haupt, S., Cohen, M.X., Elger, C.E., Fell, J., Interference of working memory load with long-term memory formation (2009) Eur J Neurosci, 29, pp. 1501-1513; Barry, W.T., Nobel, A.B., Wright, F.A., Significance analysis of functional categories in gene expression studies: a structured permutation approach (2005) Bioinformatics, 21, pp. 1943-1949; Barta, P.E., Pearlson, G.D., Powers, R.E., Richards, S.S., Tune, L.E., Auditory hallucinations and smaller superior temporal gyral volume in schizophrenia (1990) Am J Psychiatry, 147, pp. 1457-1462; Berman, K.F., Schmidt, P.J., Rubinow, D.R., Danaceau, M.A., Van Horn, J.D., Esposito, G., Modulation of cognition-specific cortical activity by gonadal steroids: a positron-emission tomography study in women (1997) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 94, pp. 8836-8841; Beveridge, N.J., Gardiner, E., Carroll, A.P., Tooney, P.A., Cairns, M.J., Schizophrenia is associated with an increase in cortical microRNA biogenesis (2010) Mol Psychiatry, 15, pp. 1176-1189; Boks, M.P., Derks, E.M., Weisenberger, D.J., Strengman, E., Janson, E., Sommer, I.E., The relationship of DNA methylation with age, gender and genotype in twins and healthy controls (2009) PLoS One, 4, p. e6767; Bosia, M., Riccaboni, R., Poletti, S., Neurofunctional correlates of theory of mind deficits in schizophrenia (2012) Curr Top Med Chem, 12, pp. 2284-2302; Bowie, C.R., Harvey, P.D., Cognitive deficits and functional outcome in schizophrenia (2006) Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat, 2, pp. 531-536; Brauns, S., Gollub, R.L., Roffman, J.L., Yendiki, A., Ho, B.-C., Wassink, T.H., DISC1 is associated with cortical thickness and neural efficiency (2011) Neuroimage, 57, pp. 1591-1600; Camchong, J., Lim, K.O., Sponheim, S.R., Macdonald, A.W., Frontal white matter integrity as an endophenotype for schizophrenia: diffusion tensor imaging in monozygotic twins and patients' nonpsychotic relatives (2009) Front Hum Neurosci, 3, p. 35; Chen, Y.-H., Edgar, J.C., Huang, M., Hunter, M.A., Epstein, E., Howell, B., Frontal and superior temporal auditory processing abnormalities in schizophrenia (2013) Neuroimage Clin, 2, pp. 695-702; Cheng, H.-Y.M., Papp, J.W., Varlamova, O., Dziema, H., Russell, B., Curfman, J.P., MicroRNA modulation of circadian-clock period and entrainment (2007) Neuron, 54, pp. 813-829; Lee, S.H., Ripke, S., Neale, B.M., Faraone, S.V., Purcell, S.M., Genetic relationship between five psychiatric disorders estimated from genome-wide SNPs (2013) Nat Genet, 45, pp. 984-994; Curradi, M., Izzo, A., Badaracco, G., Landsberger, N., Molecular mechanisms of gene silencing mediated by DNA methylation (2002) Mol Cell Biol, 22, pp. 3157-3173; Edgar, J.C., Chen, Y.H., Lanza, M., Howell, B., Chow, V.Y., Heiken, K., Cortical thickness as a contributor to abnormal oscillations in schizophrenia?

Nogo, an oligodendrocyte bound molecule, signals by binding to the Nogo receptor (NgR) located on axonal membranes. The NgR co-receptors include p75 neurotrophin receptor or TNF receptor orphan Y (TROY). Nogo signaling is responsible for central nervous system myelin regulation and neurite outgrowth during neurodevelopment, and plasticity in the mature brain. Methods: We examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NgR, p75, and TROY receptor genes and downstream signaling partner With No Lysine (K) (WNK1) and Myelin transcription factor 1-like (Myt1l) genes in an Australian case-control schizophrenia cohort (n= 268/group). High-throughput SNP genotyping was performed using the MassARRAY® genotyping assay. Results: Analysis revealed a significant association between the Myt1l SNP rs2304008 and female schizophrenia subjects. The WNK1 SNP rs1468326 and the Myt1l SNP rs3748988 showed significant associations with schizophrenia in subjects with a maternal mental history and in subjects who experienced childhood trauma respectively. Following Bonferroni correction, all significance was lost. Conclusions: Despite the lack of positive findings in our population after correction for multiple testing, previous gene expression and association studies in schizophrenia suggest the implication of NgR signaling pathway genes in the etiology of schizophrenia remains topical and timely. General significance: Further investigations will be necessary to fully assess the role of these genes in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However these genes may prove useful in further understanding the mechanism by which negative experiences early in life can affect myelin-related processes in the context of schizophrenia. © 2014.","Case-control gene association; Childhood trauma; NgR signaling genes; Schizophrenia","Huber, A.B., Weinmann, O., Brosamle, C., Oertle, T., Schwab, M.E., Patterns of Nogo mRNA and protein expression in the developing and adult rat and after CNS lesions (2002) J.

Here, we determine the extent to which serum testosterone levels are related to neural activity in affective processing circuitry in men with schizophrenia. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal changes as 32 healthy controls and 26 people with schizophrenia performed a facial emotion identification task. Whole brain analyses were performed to determine regions of differential activity between groups during processing of angry versus non-threatening faces. A follow-up ROI analysis using a regression model in a subset of 16 healthy men and 16 men with schizophrenia was used to determine the extent to which serum testosterone levels were related to neural activity. Healthy controls displayed significantly greater activation than people with schizophrenia in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). There was no significant difference in circulating testosterone levels between healthy men and men with schizophrenia. Regression analyses between activation in the IFG and circulating testosterone levels revealed a significant positive correlation in men with schizophrenia (r= .63, p= .01) and no significant relationship in healthy men. This study provides the first evidence that circulating serum testosterone levels are related to IFG activation during emotion face processing in men with schizophrenia but not in healthy men, which suggests that testosterone levels modulate neural processes relevant to facial emotion processing that may interfere with social functioning in men with schizophrenia. © 2015.","Emotional face processing; Inferior frontal gyrus; Schizophrenia; Testosterone","Ihnen, G.H., Penn, D.L., Corrigan, P.W., Martin, J., Social perception and social skill in schizophrenia (1998) Psychiatry Res, 80, pp. 275-286; Kohler, C.G., Walker, J.B., Martin, E.A., Healey, K.M., Moberg, P.J., Facial emotion perception in schizophrenia: a meta-analytic review (2010) Schizophr Bull, 36, pp. 1009-1019; Edwards, J., Pattison, P.E., Jackson, H.J., Wales, R.J., Facial affect and affective prosody recognition in first-episode schizophrenia (2001) Schizophr Res, 48, pp. 235-253; Kohler, C.G., Turner, T.H., Bilker, W.B., Brensinger, C.M., Siegel, S.J., Kanes, S.J., Facial emotion recognition in schizophrenia: intensity effects and error pattern (2003) Am J Psychiatry, 160, pp. 1768-1774; Mandal, M.K., Pandey, R., Prasad, A.B., Facial expressions of emotions and schizophrenia: a review (1998) Schizophr Bull, 24, pp. 399-412; Gur, R.E., McGrath, C., Chan, R.M., Schroeder, L., Turner, T., Turetsky, B.I., An fMRI study of facial emotion processing in patients with schizophrenia (2002) Am J Psychiatry, 159, pp. 1992-1999; Holt, D.J., Kunkel, L., Weiss, A.P., Goff, D.C., Wright, C.I., Shin, L.M., Increased medial temporal lobe activation during the passive viewing of emotional and neutral facial expressions in schizophrenia (2006) Schizophr Res, 82, pp. 153-162; Phillips, M.L., Williams, L., Senior, C., Bullmore, E.T., Brammer, M.J., Andrew, C., A differential neural response to threatening and non-threatening negative facial expressions in paranoid and non-paranoid schizophrenics.

The already published reviews do not address the current scientific literature in a complete manner. Therefore, here we tried to answer some questions that remain to be clarified, particularly: are the non-emotional aspects of facial processing in fact impaired in schizophrenia patients? At the behavioral level, our key conclusions are that visual perception deficit in schizophrenia patients: are not specific to faces; are most often present when the cognitive (e.g. attention) and perceptual demands of the tasks are important; and seems to worsen with the illness chronification. Although, currently evidence suggests impaired second order configural processing, more studies are necessary to determine whether or not holistic processing is impaired in schizophrenia patients. Neural and neurophysiological evidence suggests impaired earlier levels of visual processing, which might involve the deficits in interaction of the magnocellular and parvocellular pathways impacting on further processing. These deficits seem to be present even before the disorder out-set. Although evidence suggests that this deficit may be not specific to faces, further evidence on this question is necessary, in particularly more ecological studies including context and body processing. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Face perception; Face recognition; Holistic processing; Identity perception; Schizophrenia","Addington, J., Addington, D., Facial affect recognition and information processing in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (1998) Schizophr.

Methods: Alcohol use pattern of 254 schizophrenia patients in the past year was compared with randomly selected healthy comparison subjects (n. = 350) from the same community in an administrative block of rural India using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Results: A significantly smaller proportion of patients used alcohol in the past year (10.2%; 95% CI: 6.5%-14.0%) than controls (18.3%; 95% CI: 15.8%-24.1%; OR. = 2.2; 95% CI. = 1.4-3.5). This was true for AUD (hazardous use and harmful use; total AUDIT score >. 8) also: 5.5% patients (95% CI: 2.7%-8.3%) and 10.3% controls (95% CI: 7.1%-13.4%) had hazardous use (OR. = 2.0; 95% CI. = 1.0-3.7). Hazardous use was associated with domicile in villages and lesser years of education. On logistic regression, after controlling for these confounds, the odds of having AUD were 2.7 times more for controls than for patients (95% CI. = 1.4-5.2). Conclusions: Prevalence of AUD is significantly lower in patients than in the general population in this community. Cross-cultural studies are needed to elucidate factors that underlie contrasting results across different countries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Alcohol Use Disorders; Rural India; Schizophrenia","Babor, T.F., Higgins-Biddle, J.C., Saunders, J.B., Monteiro, M.G., (2001) AUDIT: The alcohol use disorders identification test-Guidelines for use in primary care, , http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_MSD_MSB_01.6a.pdf, Geneva, Available at, (accessed on 24 December 2013); Brady, K.T., Sinha, R., Co-occurring mental and substance use disorders: The neurobiological effects of chronic stress (2005) American Journal of Psychiatry, 162 (8), pp. 1483-1493; Carey, K.B., Carey, M.P., Chandra, P.S., Psychometric evaluation of the alcohol use disorders identification test and short drug abuse screening test with psychiatric patients in India (2003) Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 64 (7), pp. 767-774; Chand, P.K., Thirthalli, J., Murthy, P., Substance use disorders among treatment naïve first-episode psychosis patients (2014) Comprehensive Psychiatry, 55 (1), pp. 165-169; Dixon, L., Dual diagnosis of substance abuse in schizophrenia: Prevalence and impact on outcomes (1999) Schizophrenia Research, 35, pp. 93-100; Drake, R.E., Mueser, K.T., Alcohol-use disorder and severe mental illness (1996) Alcohol Health & Research World, 20, pp. 87-93; Gregg, L., Barrowclough, C., Haddock, G., Reasons for increased substance use in psychosis (2007) Clinical Psychology Review, 27 (4), pp. 494-510; Harrison, E.R., Haaga, J., Richards, T., Self-reported drug use data: What do they reveal?

Although the term is encountered in clinical practice and in the literature, there is no consensus regarding its exact meaning. This article is a narrative review of the literature on antipsychotic medication and dysphoria based on a pubmed database search. We found that antipsychotic medication-induced dysphoria is a term used to describe a negative and unpleasant affective state which seems to be more often associated with high potency first-generation antipsychotics and could potentially lead to medication non-adherence. Though it is plausible to expect antipsychotic medication-induced dysphoria to be related to extrapyramidal symptoms, most especially akathisia, the nature of the association remains unspecified. Furthermore, there is some evidence that dopamine blockade maybe involved in the pathogenesis of antipsychotic medication-induced dysphoria. However, the limited methods of the currently available studies make it impossible to conclusively address the question of which class of antipsychotic (first- or second-generation) has a higher prevalence and severity of the syndrome. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adherence; Dysphoria; First-generation antipsychotics; Neuroleptics; Schizophrenia; Second-generation antipsychotics","King, C., Voruganti, L.N., What’s in a name?

Specifically, what causes mimicry to occur within a given social interaction and what are the downstream consequences of such mimicry?

We genotyped a large set of healthy individuals for loci that represent established genetic indicators of serum testosterone and oxytocin levels, and tested for associations of these genetic indices of hormone levels with self-report measures of autistic and schizotypal cognition. A low genetic index of testosterone, a high genetic index of oxytocin, and/or a low ratio of testosterone to oxytocin indices were positively correlated with high imagination (by the Autism Quotient) and high positive and total schizotypy (by the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire). The genetic indices for oxytocin, and testosterone relative to oxytocin, also showed significant correlations with a metric of positive schizotypy relative to autism, implicating higher oxytocin and lower testosterone in increased positively-schizotypal traits combined with decreased autism-associated traits.

Research on EG and ED is in its infancy; however, as reviewed in this paper, accumulating evidence suggests that EG and ED are associated with psychosocial adjustment. Studies have demonstrated that schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, major depression, autism, and alcohol problems are associated with lower levels of EG/ED. This evidence strongly suggests that EG/ED may represent emotion regulation resources that buffer against the deleterious consequences of negative emotions. Research more clearly establishing the nature and construct validity of EG/ED and more clearly specifying their role in the development of psychosocial adjustment problems is needed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Haidt, J., (2013) The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion, , Random House LLC; (2011) What Neuroscience Tells Us about Morality: Braintrust, , Princeton University Press, P.S.

Liver trazodone concentrations were compared to peripheral blood and central blood concentrations in 19 medical examiner cases. Postmortem blood specimens were initially screened for alcohol and simple volatiles, drugs of abuse, and alkaline drugs. Trazodone, when detected by the alkaline drug screen, was subsequently confirmed and quantified by a high performance liquid chromatography procedure. Re-analyses showed that there may be degradation of trazodone in postmortem blood stored at 4 °C There was, on average, about a 20% decrease in samples stored up to eight months. These data suggest that postmortem trazodone peripheral blood concentrations may be considered non-toxic to at least 1.0 mg/L with liver concentrations to at least 2.2 mg/kg. Overall, trazodone concentrations ranged from 0.08-6.1 mg/L in peripheral blood, 0.07-7.1 mg/L in central blood, and 039-26 mg/kg in liver. The median trazodone central blood to peripheral blood ratio was 0.98 (N = 19) The liver to peripheral blood ratios showed a median value of 2.8 L/kg (N = 18). Given that a liver to peripheral blood ratio less than 5 L/kg is consistent with little to no propensity for postmortem redistribution, these data demonstrate that trazodone is unlikely to show significant redistribution. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Central blood; Liver; Peripheral blood; Postmortem redistribution; Trazodone","(accessed November 2014)(2011) Clarke's Analysis of Drugs and Poisons, , Pharmaceutical Press, London, UK, A.C.

However, the implementation of prediction algorithms which are able to assist physicians in the diagnostic is a difficult task. In this paper we propose, for the first time, an automatic approach for classification of multiple psychiatric conditions based on saccades. In particular, the goal is to classify 6 medical conditions: Alcoholism, Alzheimer's disease, opioid dependence (two groups of subjects with measurements respectively taken prior to and after administering synthetic opioid), Parkinson's disease, and Schizophrenia. Our approach integrates different feature spaces corresponding to complementary characterizations of the saccadic behavior. We define a multi-view model of saccades in which the feature representations capture characteristic temporal and amplitude patterns of saccades. Four of the current most advanced classification methods are used to discriminate among the psychiatric conditions and leave-one-out cross-validation is used to evaluate the classifiers. Classification accuracies well above the chance levels are obtained for the different classification tasks investigated. The confusion matrices reveal that it is possible to separate conditions into different groups. We conclude that using relatively simple descriptors of the saccadic behavior it is possible to simultaneously classify among 6 different types of psychiatric conditions. Conceptually, our multi-view classification method excels other approaches that focus on statistical differences in the saccadic behavior of cases and controls because it can be used for predicting unseen cases. Classification integrating different characterizations of the saccades can actually help to predict the conditions of new patients, opening the possibility to integrate automatic analysis of saccades as a practical procedure for differential diagnosis in Psychiatry. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We sought to determine the neural correlates of intra-individual RT variability during a go/no-go response inhibition task in 27 healthy, male participants. We found that reduced trial-to-trial RT variability (i.e. greater response stability) was significantly associated with greater activation in the left pregenual anterior cingulate. These results support the role of the left anterior cingulate in the dynamic control of attention and efficient response selection. Greater understanding of intra-individual RT variability and top-down attentional control in healthy adults may help to inform disorders that impact executive/attentional control, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Anterior cingulate cortex; Attention; FMRI; Intra-individual variability","Ashburner, J., A fast diffeomorphic image registration algorithm (2007) Neuroimage, 38 (1), pp. 95-113; Bellgrove, M.A., Hawi, Z., Kirley, A., Gill, M., Robertson, I.H., Dissecting the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) phenotype: sustained attention, response variability and spatial attentional asymmetries in relation to dopamine transporter (DAT1) genotype (2005) Neuropsychologia, 43 (13), pp. 1847-1857; Bellgrove, M.A., Hester, R., Garavan, H., The functional neuroanatomical correlates of response variability: evidence from a response inhibition task (2004) Neuropsychologia, 42 (14), pp. 1910-1916; Castellanos, F.X., Sonuga-Barke, E.J.S., Milham, M.P., Tannock, R., Characterizing cognition in ADHD: beyond executive dysfunction (2006) Trends Cogn.

Furthermore, the ethanol extract of CI leaves effectively ameliorated methamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion (MIH) in mice, an animal model mimicking the hyper-dopaminergic status of tic disorders/Tourette syndrome, schizophrenia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Here, we for the first time identified a constituent able to reduce MIH from the CI ethanol extract that might represent a novel lead for the treatment of such disorders. Materials and methods The ethanol extract of CI was sub-divided into n-hexane, dichloromethane, n-butanol and water fractions. Using MIH alleviation as a bioassay, active compounds were identified in these fractions using silica gel chromatography, recrystallization and proton NMR spectroscopy. Results The dichloromethane and n-hexane fractions were active in the bioassay. Further subfractionation and re-crystallization resulted in an active compound that was identified to be hispidulin by proton NMR spectroscopy. Hispidulin significantly alleviated MIH in mice at doses that did not affect their spontaneous locomotor activity or performance in the rotarod test, a measure for motor coordination. Conclusions Hispidulin is a flavonoid that has been isolated from several plants and reported to have anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. Here, we for the very first time found that hispidulin can also alleviate MIH at doses that did not impair motor activity, suggesting a therapeutic potential of hispidulin in hyper-dopaminergic disorders. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Clerodendrum inerme; Flavonoids; Hispidulin; Methamphetamine; Motortics; Tourettesyndrome","Abdalla, S., Abu-Zarga, M., Afifi, F., Al-Khalil, S., Sabri, S., Effects of hispidulin, a flavone isolated from Inula viscosa, on isolated guinea-pig smooth muscle (1988) Gen.

Recognition memory is disturbed in a range of human disorders and NOR is widely used in rodents for investigating deficits in a variety of animal models of human conditions where cognition is impaired. It possesses several advantages over more complex tasks that involve lengthy training procedures and/or food or water deprivation. It is quick to administer, non-rewarded, provides data quickly, cost effective and most importantly, ethologically relevant as it relies on the animal's natural preference for novelty. A PubMed search revealed over 900 publications in rats and mice using this task over the past 3 years with 34 reviews in the past 10 years, demonstrating its increasing popularity with neuroscientists. Although it is widely used in many disparate areas of research, no articles have systematically examined this to date, which is the subject of our review. We reveal that NOR may be used to study recognition memory deficits that occur in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, where research is extensive, in Parkinson's disease and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) where we observed markedly reduced numbers of publications. In addition, we review the use of NOR to study cognitive deficits induced by traumatic brain injury and cancer chemotherapy, not disorders per se, but situations in which cognitive deficits dramatically reduce the quality of life for those affected, see Fig. 1 for a summary. Our review reveals that, in all these animal models, the NOR test is extremely useful for identification of the cognitive deficits observed, their neural basis, and for testing the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents. Our conclusion is that NOR is of considerable value for cognitive researchers of all disciplines and we anticipate that its use will continue to increase due to its versatility and several other advantages, as detailed in this review. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Alzheimer's disease;

In addition, studies using animal models have demonstrated that chronic stress affects hippocampal structure and function. However, the functional effects of chronic stress on DISC1 remain unknown. Using a chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm, we investigated the effects of CMS on depressive-like behaviors, hippocampal cell proliferation, and hippocampal protein expression of DISC1, phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 2B subunit (NMDA receptor 2B), which may be involved in the regulation of DISC1 and neurogenesis. We also examined the effects and possible mechanisms of the antidepressant venlafaxine in CMS mice. CMS increased the expression of DISC1 and PDE4B. Chronic treatment with venlafaxine blocked the increases in these proteins, and also reversed the CMS-induced decrease in neurogenesis and NMDA receptor 2B protein in the hippocampus. These results suggest that DISC1 may play an important role in the etiology of depression and in the action of antidepressants. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Acute administration of atypical, e.g. lurasidone, but not typical antipsychotic drugs (APDs), e.g. haloperidol, are able to restore NOR following PCP (acute reversal model). Furthermore, atypical APDs, when co-administered with PCP, have been shown to prevent development of NOR deficits (prevention model). Most atypical, but not typical APDs, are more potent 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonists than dopamine (DA) D2 antagonists, and have been shown to enhance cortical and hippocampal efflux and to be direct or indirect 5-HT1A agonists in vivo. To further clarify the importance of these actions to the restoration of NOR by atypical APDs, sub-effective or non-effective doses of combinations of the 5-HT1A partial agonist (tandospirone), the 5-HT2A inverse agonist (pimavanserin), or the D2 antagonist (haloperidol), as well as the combination of all three agents, were studied in the acute reversal and prevention PCP models of CIS. Only the combination of all three agents restored NOR and prevented the development of PCP-induced deficit. Thus, this triple combination of 5-HT1A agonism, 5-HT2A antagonism/inverse agonism, and D2 antagonism is able to mimic the ability of atypical APDs to prevent or ameliorate the PCP-induced NOR deficit, possibly by stimulating signaling cascades from D1 and 5-HT1A receptor stimulation, modulated by D2 and 5-HT2A receptor antagonism. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","5-HT1A; 5-HT2A; Antipsychotic; D2; NOR; Phencyclidine","Meltzer, H.Y., McGurk, S.R., The effects of clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine on cognitive function in schizophrenia (1999) Schizophr Bull, 25, pp. 233-255; Saykin, A.J., Gur, R.C., Gur, R.E., Mozley, P.D., Mozley, L.H., Resnick, S.M., Neuropsychological function in schizophrenia.

Previous meta-analytic reviews of CBT interventions in this population have not investigated potential moderators of treatment efficacy specific to this type of therapy. Method Forty randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of CBT during pregnancy and the first year postpartum were included in the meta-analyses. Change in depressive symptoms from pre-treatment to post-treatment was assessed in both treatment and prevention trials, and the difference in prevalence of postpartum depressive episodes was assessed in prevention trials. Characteristics of included studies, interventions and samples were assessed as potential moderators of effect sizes. Results CBT interventions resulted in significant reductions in depressive symptoms compared to control conditions in both treatment and prevention studies. In prevention studies, individuals who received CBT had significantly lower rates of postpartum depressive episodes compared to control conditions. In both treatment and prevention trials, interventions initiated during the postpartum period were more effective than antenatal interventions. In prevention trials, individually-administered treatments were more effective than group interventions and greater reductions in depressive symptoms were found in studies that included higher proportions of nonwhite, single, and multiparous participants. Limitations The methodological quality of included studies varied widely among studies eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Conclusions There is strong evidence that CBT interventions are effective for treating and preventing depression during the perinatal period. Further methodologically rigorous studies are needed to further investigate potential moderators of treatment efficacy. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cognitive behavioral therapy; Depression; Meta-analysis; Postpartum; Pregnancy","Ammerman, R.T., Putnam, F.W., Altaye, M., Stevens, J., Teeters, A.R., Van Ginkel, J.B., A clinical trial of In-Home CBT for depressed mothers in home visitation (2013) Behav.

We hypothesised that the ARCS would be able to better discriminate between individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls than the MMSE, and that ARCS performance would be correlated with measures of social and vocational functioning. Methods: The participants were 19 community-dwelling individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 19 healthy controls recruited from the Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank (ASRB). Participants completed the ARCS, MMSE, and self-report measures of social and vocational functioning. Clinical and diagnostic data stored by the ASRB were also utilised. Results: The schizophrenia group performed worse than the control group on the ARCS, with memory, t(36)=2.49, p=0.02, 95% CI [−1.84, −18.79] and fluency, t(36)=2.40, p=0.02, 95% CI [−1.87, −22.24] domains being the main discriminating measures. The RBANS also discriminated between the two groups, and ARCS and RBANS total scores were moderately to strongly correlated. There was no difference between the two groups on the MMSE after controlling for demographic variables. ARCS performance was associated with employment status [χ2(1)=7.16, p=0.007]. Conclusion: The ARCS may be sensitive to the cognitive deficits in outpatients with schizophrenia and an indicator of functional outcomes in this population. © Scandinavian College of Neuropsychopharmacology 2015 This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","cognition; memory; psychosis; schizophrenia",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929001653

This follow-up of a randomized trial examined whether an intervention for parents, based on motivational interviewing and interaction skills (Family Motivational Intervention, FMI), was more effective than routine family support (RFS) in reducing cannabis use in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia. Method: In a single-blind trial with 75 patients in treatment for recent-onset schizophrenia, 97 parents were randomly assigned to either FMI or RFS. Assessments were conducted at baseline and at 3 and 15 months after the interventions had been ended. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effect regression models. Results: From baseline to the 15-month follow-up, there was a significantly greater reduction in FMI compared to RFS in patients’ quantity (p = 0.01) and frequency (p < 0.01) of cannabis use. Patients’ craving for cannabis use was also significantly lower in FMI at 15 months follow-up (p < 0.01). Both groups improved in parental distress and sense of burden; however, only FMI parents’ appraisal of patients’ symptoms showed further improvement at the 15-month follow-up (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The results support the sustained effectiveness of FMI in reducing cannabis use in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia at 15 months follow-up.

However, few studies have used prospectively collected data to specifically investigate parental separation across development, or assessed the importance of duration of separation, and family characteristics. Method: We measured three types of separation not due to death: maternal, paternal, and from both parents, across the ages of 1–15 years among a cohort of 985 058 individuals born in Denmark 1971–1991 and followed to 2011. Associations with narrowly and broadly defined schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the psychiatric register were assessed in terms of separation occurrence, age of separation, and number of years separated. Interactions with parental history of mental disorder were assessed. Results: Each type of separation was associated with all three outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, birth period, calendar year, family history of mental disorder, urbanicity at birth and parental age. Number of years of paternal separation was positively associated with both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Associations between separation from both parents and schizophrenia were stronger when separation occurred at later ages, while those with bipolar disorder remained stable across development. The first occurrence of paternal separation appeared to increase risk more when it occurred earlier in childhood. Associations differed according to parental history of mental disorder, although in no situation was separation protective. Conclusions: Effects of parental separation may differ by type, developmental timing and family characteristics. These findings highlight the importance of considering such factors in studies of childhood adversity.

Methods: Total 259 students from 20 universities answered an anonymous self-administered questionnaire about their mental health-related experiences, and stigma scales including feasible knowledge and negative stereotypes for four specific diseases, including schizophrenia (old and new names), depression, and diabetes mellitus. We also asked to choose the old and new names of schizophrenia and dementia among ten names for mental and physical illnesses and conditions. Results: The participants had more feasible knowledge and fewer negative stereotypes for the new name of schizophrenia than the old name, but were still significantly worse than for depression and diabetes mellitus (p < 0.01). Direct contact experiences with those who have mental health problems were associated with feasible knowledge for schizophrenia but not negative stereotypes (β = 0.13, p = 0.020). The rate of correct responses for the old and new names of schizophrenia was significantly lower than that of dementia (41 vs. 87 %, p < 0.001). Mental health-related experience from media was associated with the recognition of name change for schizophrenia (p = 0.008), which was associated with less feasible knowledge for new name of schizophrenia. Discussion: The name change of schizophrenia has reduced stigma since 12 years have passed. More effective campaigns, educational curricula, and policy making are needed to reduce stigma toward schizophrenia. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Name change; Schizophrenia; Stereotyping; Stigma; Terminology",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928978453

Thus, NMDA-R blockade has been used to model schizophrenia in experimental animals. Acute and repeated treatments have been successfully tested; however, long-term exposure to NMDA-R antagonists more likely resembles the core symptoms of the illness. Objectives: To explore whether schizophrenia-related behaviors are differentially induced by acute and subchronic phencyclidine (PCP) treatment in mice and to examine the neurobiological bases of these differences. Results: Subchronic PCP induced a sensitization of acute locomotor effects. Spontaneous alternation in a T-maze and novel object recognition performance were impaired after subchronic but not acute PCP, suggesting a deficit in working memory. On the contrary, reversal learning and immobility in the tail suspension test were unaffected. Subchronic PCP significantly reduced basal dopamine but not serotonin output in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and markedly decreased the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the ventral tegmental area. Finally, acute and subchronic PCP treatments evoked a different pattern of c-fos expression. At 1 h post-treatment, acute PCP increased c-fos expression in many cortical regions, striatum, thalamus, hippocampus, and dorsal raphe. However, the increased c-fos expression produced by subchronic PCP was restricted to the retrosplenial cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and supramammillary nucleus. Four days after the last PCP injection, c-fos expression was still increased in the hippocampus of subchronic PCP-treated mice. Conclusions: Acute and subchronic PCP administration differently affects neuronal activity in brain regions relevant to schizophrenia, which could account for their different behavioral effects. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Behavior; c-fos; Dopamine; Glutamate; NMDA; Phencyclidine; Reversal learning; Schizophrenia; Serotonin; Working memory",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928969478

Prepulse inhibition (PPI), which measures the inhibition of a motor response by a weak sensory event, is considered particularly useful to understand the biology of information processing in schizophrenia patients. Drugs that facilitate dopaminergic neurotransmission such as amphetamine induce PPI disruption in human and rodents. Clinical and neurobiological findings suggest that the endocannabinoid system and cannabinoids may be implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotomimetic constituent of the Cannabis sativa plant, has also been reported to have potential as an antipsychotic. Objective: Our aim was to investigate if CBD pretreatment was able to prevent PPI disruption induced by amphetamine. Since one possible mechanism of CBD action is the facilitation of endocannabinoid-mediated neurotransmission through anandamide, we tested the effects of an anandamide hydrolysis inhibitor (URB597) in the amphetamine-induced PPI disruption. Methods: Male Swiss mice were treated with CBD systemic or intra-accumbens, or URB597 (systemic) prior to amphetamine and were exposed to PPI test. Results: Amphetamine (10 mg/kg) disrupted PPI while CBD (15–60 mg/kg) or URB597 (0.1–1 mg/kg) administered alone had no effect. Pretreatment with CBD attenuated the amphetamine-disruptive effects on PPI test after systemic or intra-accumbens administration. Similar effects were also found with the inhibitor of anandamide hydrolysis. Conclusion: These results corroborate findings indicating that CBD induces antipsychotic-like effects. In addition, they pointed to the nucleus accumbens as a possible site of these effects. The increase of anandamide availability may be enrolled in the CBD effects. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Amphetamine; Antipsychotic; Cannabidiol; Nucleus accumbens; Prepulse inhibition; Schizophrenia",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928958209

Bilateral or unilateral NMDA stimulation have been applied in these studies, but have never been compared directly. Thus, results of these studies can be related to each other only with reservations. Therefore - given the substantial interest in the behavioral effects of hippocampal overactivity and the neural substrates underlying PPI with respect to schizophrenia - the present experiments compared hyperactivity and PPI disruption following uni- or bilateral NMDA stimulation of the ventral hippocampus. Both bilateral and unilateral infusion of NMDA (0.5. μg/0.5. μl/side) induced hyperactivity in the open field and disrupted PPI.

Differences in receptor binding, 5-HT<inf>2A</inf>/D<inf>2</inf> (serotonin/dopamine) binding ratios, and mitochondrial proteomics suggest that the effects of risperidone and paliperidone on neuronal firing, regulation of mitochondrial function, and movement are different. This review seeks to explore the most significant differences at the molecular level between risperidone and paliperidone, as reported in preclinical studies. Although risperidone shows higher affinity for 5-HT receptors, paliperidone does not fit this profile. Thus, the risperidone 5-HT<inf>2A</inf>/D<inf>2</inf> binding ratio is significantly lower than the paliperidone 5-HT<inf>2A</inf>/D<inf>2</inf> binding ratio. Paliperidone, similar to lithium and valproate, affects expression levels and phosphorylation of complex I and V proteins in synaptoneurosomal preparations of rat prefrontal cortex, suggesting that paliperidone behaves as a mood stabilizer. It is apparent that the presence of a hydroxyl group in the paliperidone molecule confers increased hydrophilicity to this drug compared with its parent, risperidone; thus, this contributes to differential effects on mitochondrial movement, protein expression, and phosphorylation. These differences are reflected in synaptic plasticity and neuronal firing and have only recently been implicated in the mechanisms of mitochondrial function and movement. © 2015 The Author(s)",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928963209

Here, we aimed to advance our hypothesis that glucocorticoids (GCs), recognised key players in neurobiological programming, target development within these systems, with a novel focus on the astrocytic population. Mice received antenatal GC treatment (AGT) by including the synthetic GC, dexamethasone, in the mothers’ drinking water on gestational days 16–19; controls received normal drinking water. Analyses of regional shapes and volumes of the adult SNc and VTA demonstrated that AGT induced long-term, dose-dependent, structural changes that were accompanied by profound effects on astrocytes (doubling/tripling of numbers and/or density). Additionally, AGT induced long-term changes in the population size and distribution of SNc/VTA dopaminergic neurons, confirming and extending our previous observations made in rats. Furthermore, glial/neuronal structural remodelling was sexually dimorphic and depended on the AGT dose and sub-region of the SNc/VTA. Investigations within the neonatal brain revealed that these long-term organisational effects of AGT depend, at least in part, on targeting perinatal processes that determine astrocyte density and programmed cell death in dopaminergic neurons. Collectively, our characterisation of enduring, AGT-induced, sex-specific cytoarchitectural disturbances suggests novel mechanistic links for the strong association between early environmental challenge (inappropriate exposure to excess GCs) and vulnerability to developing aberrant behaviours in later life, with translational implications for dopamine-associated disorders (such as schizophrenia, ADHD, autism, depression), which typically show a sex bias. © 2015 The Author(s)","Antenatal GC treatment; Astrocytes; Dopaminergic neurons; Midbrain; Neurobiological programming; Sex dimorphisms",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928974668

Ketamine is known as a core medication in anesthesiology and has recently gained interest in ECT practice as there are three potential advantages: (1) ketamine has no anticonvulsive actions, (2) according to recent studies ketamine could possess a unique intrinsic antidepressive potential and (3) ketamine may exhibit neuroprotective properties, which again might reduce the risk of cognitive side effects associated with ECT. Objectives: The use of ketamine in psychiatric patients has been controversially discussed due to its dose-dependent psychotropic and psychotomimetic effects. This study was carried out to test if the occurrence of side effects is comparable and if seizure quality is better with ketamine when compared to thiopental. Material and methods: This retrospective study analyzed a total of 199 patients who received ketamine anesthesia for a total of 2178 ECT sessions. This cohort was compared to patients who were treated with thiopental for 1004 ECT sessions. Results and discussion: A repeated measurement multiple logistic regression analysis revealed significant advantages in the ketamine group for seizure concordance and postictal suppression (both are surrogates for central inhibition). S-ketamin also necessitated the use of a higher dose of urapidil and a higher maximum postictal heart frequency. Clinically relevant psychiatric side effects were rare in both groups. No psychiatric side effects occurred in the subgroup of patients with schizophrenia (ketamine: n = 30). The mean dose of S-ketamine used increased in the first years but stabilized at 63 mg per patient in 2014. From these experiences it can be concluded that S-ketamine can be recommended at least as a safe alternative to barbiturates. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Blood pressure; Heart rate; Mental disorders; Seizure; Thiopental",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928964106

A domain gauge provides, for any tested intervention, a ""classifier"" as a measure of response strength with respect to the domain in question, and a ""differentiator"" as a measure of deviation from the domain profile, both along with error ranges. Capitalizing on our in-house database with an unprecedented wealth of standardized perfusion-based phMRI data obtained from rats subjected to various validated treatments, we exemplarily focused on 3 domains based on therapeutic indications: an antipsychotic, an antidepressant and an anxiolytic domain. The domain profiles identified as part of the gauge definition process, as well as the outputs of the gauges when applied to both reference and validation data, were evaluated for their reconcilability with prior biological knowledge and for their performance in drug characterization. The domain profiles provided quantitative activation patterns with high biological plausibility. The antipsychotic profile, for instance, comprised key areas (e.g., cingulate cortex, nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra) which are believed to be strongly involved in mediating an antipsychotic effect, and which are in line with network-level dysfunctions observed in schizophrenia. The domain gauges plausibly positioned the vast majority of the pharmacological and even non-pharmacological treatments. The results also suggest the segregation of sub-domains based on, e.g., the mode of action. Upon judicious selection of domains and careful calibration of the gauges, our approach represents a valuable analytical tool for biological interpretation and decision making in drug discovery. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Arterial spin labeling (ASL); Drug discovery; Linear discriminant analysis (LDA); Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA); Pharmacological MRI (phMRI); Psychoactive drugs","Adachi, Y.U., Yamada, S., Satomoto, M., Higuchi, H., Watanabe, K., Kazama, T., Mimuro, S., Sato, S., Isoflurane anesthesia inhibits clozapine- and risperidone-induceddopamine release and anesthesia-induced changes in dopamine metabolism was modified by fluoxetine in the rat striatum: an invivo microdialysis study (2008) Neurochem.

MIRRORS is an adaptation of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction designed to help persons with schizophrenia to persist and perform better at work. Thirty-four participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were engaged in outpatient services were enrolled in a vocational rehabilitation program that included a job placement and then were randomized to receive MIRRORS (n = 18) or Intensive Support (n = 16) over a period of 16 weeks. The number of hours worked was recorded weekly and job performance was assessed monthly using the Work Behavior Inventory. Results of t-tests revealed that participants in the MIRRORS group worked a significantly greater number of hours and performed significantly better at the end of the 4-month intervention than those in the Intensive Support condition. Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed that the MIRRORS group worked more hours each week on average and that this difference increased over time as well as having generally better work performance compared with the Intensive Support group.

In light of recent findings correlating hippocampal volume change and clinical outcome in first-episode psychotic adults, we hypothesized that fewer decreases in hippocampal volume would be associated with better functional outcome and fewer psychotic symptoms in our rare and chronically ill population of childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS) patients. Method: We prospectively obtained 114 structural brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) from 27 COS subjects, each with three or more scans between the ages of 10 and 30 years. Change in hippocampal volume, measured by fit slope and percentage change, was regressed against clinical ratings (Children's Global Assessment Scale, Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms) at last scan (controlling for sex, time between scans and total intracranial volume). Results: Fewer negative symptoms were associated with less hippocampal volume decrease (fit slope: p = 0.0003, and percentage change: p = 0.005) while positive symptoms were not related to hippocampal change. There was also a relationship between improved clinical global functioning and maintained hippocampal volumes (fit slope: p = 0.025, and percentage change: p = 0.043). Conclusions: These results suggest that abnormal hippocampal development in schizophrenia can be linked to global functioning and negative symptoms. The hippocampus can be considered a potential treatment target for future therapies.

Method: Acts of physical violence committed by patients against other patients (n=10,958) or against staff (n=8429) during 2011–2013 were collected and analyzed for all hospitalized patients during the same time period to derive prevalence rates and associated odds ratios. Results: Overall, 31.4% of patients committed at least 1 violent assault during their hospitalization. Differential risk factor patterns were noted across patient and staff assault. Younger age was associated with a higher prevalence of both patient and staff assault, as was nonforensic legal status. Females had a higher prevalence of staff assault than patient assault. Ethnic groups varied on rates of patient assault, but had no significant differences for staff assault. Schizoaffective disorder was associated with higher prevalence and odds of patient (OR 1.244, 95% CI 1.131 to 1.370) and staff (OR 1.346, 95% CI 1.202 to 1.507) assault when compared to patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Most personality disorder diagnoses also had a higher prevalence and odds of physical violence. One percent of patients accounted for 28.7% of all assaults. Additionally, violent patients had a significantly longer length of hospitalization. Discussion: Implications of these findings to enhance patient safety and inform future violence reduction efforts, including the need for new treatments in conjunction with the use of violence risk assessments, are discussed. © Cambridge University Press 2015","Aggression; assault; forensic; hospital; inpatient; mental illness; psychiatric; schizoaffective; schizophrenia; violence",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929000288

He was one of the first to bypass execution by reason of insanity and spent the remainder of his life in the Bethlem and Broadmoor asylums. Dadd is rare both as a patient and an artist because he left behind nearly a 40-year record of artwork and journals, which constitute a unique medical and psychiatric resource at a time when the ideas on the relationship of facial expression and madness were changing. Sir Charles Bell’s (1774–1842) widely accepted views that the “face of madness” is bestial and anatomically distinctive were being challenged by such physicians as Sir Alexander Morison (1779–1866), who was also Dadd’s own “alienist” (i.e., psychiatrist). The purpose of this article is to explore the nature and extent of the influence of Bell and Morison on Dadd, which has not been brought out in the existing studies. By a comparative analysis, it will be shown that Dadd may have conveyed a different view in his works that foreshadows subsequent developments that are closer to a modern understanding. © 2015, Routledge.

This study aimed to examine the diagnostic stability of psychosis diagnoses using data from an incidence sample of psychosis cases, followed up after 10 years and to examine those baseline variables which were associated with diagnostic change. Method: Data were examined from the ÆSOP and ÆSOP-10 studies, an incidence and follow-up study, respectively, of a population-based cohort of first-episode psychosis cases from two sites. Diagnosis was assigned using ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR. Diagnostic change was examined using prospective and retrospective consistency. Baseline variables associated with change were examined using logistic regression and likelihood ratio tests. Results: Slightly more (59.6%) cases had the same baseline and lifetime ICD-10 diagnosis compared with DSM-IV-TR (55.3%), but prospective and retrospective consistency was similar. Schizophrenia, psychotic bipolar disorder and drug-induced psychosis were more prospectively consistent than other diagnoses. A substantial number of cases with other diagnoses at baseline (ICD-10, n = 61; DSM-IV-TR, n = 76) were classified as having schizophrenia at 10 years. Many variables were associated with change to schizophrenia but few with overall change in diagnosis. Conclusions: Diagnoses other than schizophrenia should to be regarded as potentially provisional.

The most commonly associated polymorphisms are located in exon 5 and segregate as part of a haplotype. So far it is unknown if this haplotype is indeed functional, or if the observed associations are an indirect effect caused by linkage disequilibrium with not yet identified adjacent functional variants. We therefore analyzed the functional relevance of the exon 5 haplotype alleles. Results: Using voltage clamp experiments we were able to show that the CHRNA4 haplotype alleles differ with respect to their functional effects on receptor sensitivity including reversal of receptor sensitivity between low and high acetylcholine concentrations. The results indicate that underlying mechanisms might include differences in codon usage bias and changes in mRNA stability. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that the complementary alleles of the CHRNA4 exon 5 haplotype are functionally relevant, and might therefore be causative for the above mentioned associations. © Eggert et al.;

To understand the links between circadian rhythms and schizophrenia, we analyzed wheel-running behavior of Sandy (Sdy) mice, which have a loss-of-function mutation in the schizophrenia risk gene Dtnbp1, and exhibit several behavioral features of schizophrenia. While rhythms of Sdy mice were mainly normal under light-dark conditions (LD) or in constant darkness (DD), they had a significantly longer free-running period under constant light (LL) compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. The mutant mice also had a higher subjective day/subjective night ratio of activity under LL, indicating lower amplitude, and a lower precision of their onsets of activity under all three lighting conditions. These observations are reminiscent of the circadian disruptions observed in schizophrenia patients. This prompted us to assess schizophrenia-relevant behavioral abnormalities in Sdy mice following alteration of the circadian rhythms by presentation of constant light. Spontaneous locomotor activity, prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle and anxiety-like behavior were assessed under baseline LD conditions, then in LL, and then again in LD. Under LL, the Sdy mice showed significantly increased spontaneous locomotion as well as deficits in PPI compared to WT mice. Strikingly, these behavioral deficits persisted even after the mice were returned in LD conditions. While LL led to an increase in anxiety-like behavior in WT animals that was fully reversed after 3 weeks in LD, this effect was not observed in the Sdy mutants. Overall, these results suggest that Dtnbp1 deficiency may lead to increased vulnerability to schizophrenia under environmental conditions where circadian rhythms are altered. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Behavior; Circadian clock; Dtnbp1; Gene-environment interaction; Light; Schizophrenia","Dibner, C., Schibler, U., Albrecht, U., The mammalian circadian timing system: organization and coordination of central and peripheral clocks (2010) Annu Rev Physiol, 72, pp. 517-549; Duguay, D., Cermakian, N., The crosstalk between physiology and circadian clock proteins (2009) Chronobiol Int, 26, pp. 1479-1513; Evans, J.A., Davidson, A.J., Health consequences of circadian disruption in humans and animal models (2013) Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci, 119, pp. 283-323; Cuesta, M., Cermakian, N., Boivin, D.B., Circadian clock genes and psychiatric disorders (2013) The genetic basis of sleep and sleep disorders, pp. 351-364. , University of Cambridge Press, P.

The concept of ""cognitive dysmetria"" has been introduced to characterize disintegration of fronto-thalamic-cerebellar circuitry which constitutes a key network for a variety of neuropsychological symptoms in schizophrenia. The present multimodal study aimed at investigating effective and structural connectivity of the fronto-thalamic circuitry in schizophrenia.fMRI effective connectivity analysis using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were combined to examine cognitive control processes in 38 patients with schizophrenia and 40 matched healthy controls. Significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) was detected in patients in the right anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), the right thalamus and the right corpus callosum. During Stroop task performance patients demonstrated significantly lower activation relative to healthy controls in a predominantly right lateralized fronto-thalamo-cerebellar network. An abnormal effective connectivity was observed in the right connections between thalamus, anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. FA in the ALIC was significantly correlated with the thalamic BOLD signal, cognitive performance and fronto-thalamic effective connectivity in patients. Present data provide evidence for the notion of a structural and functional defect in the fronto-thalamo-cerebellar circuitry, which may be the basis of specific cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","ALIC; DCM; DTI; FMRI; Schizophrenia","Andreasen, N.C., Methods for assessing positive and negative symptoms (1990) Modern Problems of Pharmacopsychiatry, 24, pp. 73-88; Andreasen, N.C., A unitary model of schizophrenia: Bleuler's ""fragmented phrene"" as schizencephaly (1999) Archives of General Psychiatry, 56 (9), pp. 781-787; Barch, D.M., Smith, E., The cognitive neuroscience of working memory: relevance to CNTRICS and schizophrenia (2008) Biological Psychiatry, 64 (1), pp. 11-17; Behrens, T.E., Woolrich, M.W., Jenkinson, M., Johansen-Berg, H., Nunes, R.G., Clare, S., Characterization and propagation of uncertainty in diffusion-weighted MR imaging (2003) Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 50 (5), pp. 1077-1088; Briggs, G.G., Nebes, R.D., Patterns of hand preference in a student population (1975) Cortex, 11 (3), pp. 230-238; Carter, C.S., van Veen, V., Anterior cingulate cortex and conflict detection: an update of theory and data (2007) Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience, 7 (4), pp. 367-379; Dauvermann, M.R., Whalley, H.C., Romaniuk, L., Valton, V., Owens, D.G., Johnstone, E.C., The application of nonlinear dynamic causal modelling for fMRI in subjects at high genetic risk of schizophrenia (2013) NeuroImage, 73, pp. 16-29; Davatzikos, C., Why voxel-based morphometric analysis should be used with great caution when characterizing group differences (2004) NeuroImage, 23 (1), pp. 17-20; Erickson, K.I., Milham, M.P., Colcombe, S.J., Kramer, A.F., Banich, M.T., Webb, A., Behavioral conflict, anterior cingulate cortex, and experiment duration: implications of diverging data (2004) Human Brain Mapping, 21 (2), pp. 98-107; Glauche, V., Mohammadi, S., Deppe, M., SPM normalization toolbox for diffusion weighted images (2010) Proceedings of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 18; Goghari, V.M., Sponheim, S.R., MacDonald, A.W., The functional neuroanatomy of symptom dimensions in schizophrenia: a qualitative and quantitative review of a persistent question (2010) Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews, 34 (3), pp. 468-486; Haber, S.N., Calzavara, R., The cortico-basal ganglia integrative network: the role of the thalamus (2009) Brain Research Bulletin, 78 (2-3), pp. 69-74; Keller, S.S., Ahrens, T., Mohammadi, S., Gerdes, J.S., Moddel, G., Kellinghaus, C., Voxel-based statistical analysis of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity in patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy of unknown cause (2012) Journal of Neuroimaging, 23 (3), pp. 352-359; Khadka, S., Meda, S.A., Stevens, M.C., Glahn, D.C., Calhoun, V.D., Sweeney, J.A., Is aberrant functional connectivity a psychosis endophenotype?

The paradigm of change blindness offers the interesting possibility of studying sensitivity to the sudden irruption of visual information with ecological stimuli in schizophrenia. An increased attentional capture by the irruption of visual information would suggest better performance in patients than in healthy controls. This approach has the advantage of circumventing a non-specific general attentional deficit in schizophrenia. Methods: Sixteen patients with schizophrenia and 16 healthy controls were asked to detect changes in 99 scenes with 0, 1 or 3 changes. We measured the participants' speed and accuracy in explicitly reporting the changes via motor responses and their capacity to implicitly detect changes via eye movements. Results: Although the controls were faster and more efficient in explicitly reporting changes, the patients' eyes shifted more quickly toward the changes. Regardless of the group, increasing the magnitude of change improved the performance. Conclusions: The better capacity of the patients to shift their eyes toward changes confirmed the capture by the sudden irruption of visual information in schizophrenia while avoiding the effects of general attentional deficits. However, the striking dissociation between this implicit response and the capacity to explicitly report changes could be interpreted as a deficit in access to conscious perception. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Change blindness; Eye tracking; Implicit response; Schizophrenia","(1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC, DSM-IV; Bestelmeyer, P.E.G., Tatler, B.W., Phillips, L.H., Fraser, G., Benson, P.J., Clair, D., Global visual scanning abnormalities in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (2006) Schizophr.

We developed a chronic animal model that shows some schizophrenia-related deficits in rats by applying selective breeding after subchronic ketamine administration connected with postweaning social isolation (complex treatment).Our aim was to determine the sex-specific effects of these interventions on several processes. Sensory gating to acoustic stimulation, pain sensitivity, motor behavior, spatial learning and memory deficits on the hole-board test were assessed in the 17th generation of selectively bred Wistar rats compared to their naive counterparts with or without complex treatment.We found differences between the sexes: selectively bred males with complex treatment showed the lowest pain sensitivity; however, the results of the prepulse inhibition test indicated that female rats showed enhanced impairment of sensory gating and increased acoustic startle reaction. The cognitive performance, working and reference memory ratios were significantly decreased by selective breeding and showed sex-specific alterations, with the smallest value in male rats of the new substrain.Based on these results, the animals of the new substrain could be classified into the high-risk for schizophreniform phenotype with the highest sensitivity of males with complex treatment. Decreased cognitive performance highlighted spatial learning deficits in the selectively bred and treated rats that escalate the validity of our new and complex rat model of schizophrenia. The results indicate the same sex selectivity as observed in humans, with increased incidence of risk ratios for men to develop schizophrenia relative to women. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Hole-board test;

As altered BDNF signaling has been implicated in multiple psychiatric diseases, here we report a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of mRNAs encoding TrkB, total BDNF, and the four most abundant BDNF transcripts (I, IIc, IV, and VI) in postmortem tissue from matched tetrads of subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy comparison subjects. In all three regions examined, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), associative striatum and hippocampus, total BDNF mRNA levels did not differ in any disease state. In DLPFC, BDNF IIc was significantly lower in schizophrenia relative to healthy comparison subjects. In hippocampus, BDNF I, IIc, and VI were lower in subjects with both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder relative to comparison subjects. In striatum, TrkB mRNA was lower in bipolar disorder and MDD, while BDNF IIc was elevated in MDD, relative to comparison subjects. These data highlight potential alterations in BDNF signaling in the corticohippocampal circuit in schizophrenia, and within the striatum in mood disorders. Novel therapies aimed at improving BDNF-TrkB signaling may therefore have potential to impact on a range of psychiatric disorders. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","BDNF; Bipolar disorder; Postmortem; RT-PCR; Schizophrenia; TrkB","Aid, T., Mouse and rat BDNF gene structure and expression revisited (2007) J.

Methods This was a single-site, longitudinal cohort study assessing the effects of treatment with flupenthixol decanoate according to a standardised protocol over 12 months in patients with schizophrenia, schizophreniform and schizo-affective disorders. Results Of 126 patients who received at least one dose of study medication, 84 (67%) completed the study. Fifteen (12%) met our predefined criteria for non-response. Non-responders were younger and at baseline had more prominent disorganised symptoms, poorer social and occupational functioning, poorer quality of life for psychological, social and environmental domains, more prominent neurological soft signs (NSS) and lower body mass index. At endpoint, the non-responders were characterised by higher levels of symptomatology in all domains, poorer functional outcome, poorer quality of life and greater cognitive impairments. They also had more prominent NSS and lower body mass index. The strongest predictors of non-response were more prominent baseline NSS and poor early (7 weeks) treatment response. Conclusions Results are consistent with a lower rate of refractoriness to treatment in first-episode schizophrenia compared with multi-episode samples. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Patients diagnosed with SSD (n = 21) treated with ECT due to resistance to AP or catatonia under the age of 18 years (ECT group), were compared to a randomly selected group of patients with SSD treated only with AP (non-ECT group) (n = 21) and matched for age, gender, diagnosis and duration of illness. Baseline data were gathered retrospectively from medical records. Subjects were assessed at follow-up (mean of follow-up period = 5.5 years; range 2–9 years) using several clinical scales such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). Improvement in PANSS positive, negative, general, total and CGI and GAF scores between baseline and follow-up assessment did not differ significantly between groups. At follow-up, no differences were observed for the PANSS negative, CGI and GAF scores between groups, but patients in the ECT group still had higher PANSS total, positive and general scores. ECT treatment followed by AP medication in treatment-resistant SSD or catatonia is at least as effective in the long term as AP alone in non-resistant patients. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Adolescents; Catatonia; Electroconvulsive therapy; Psychosis; Schizophrenia","Reichert, A., Kreiker, S., Mehler-Wex, C., Warnke, A., The psychopathological and psychosocial outcome of early-onset schizophrenia: preliminary data of a 13-year follow-up (2008) Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health, 2, p. 6. , PID: 18304312; McClellan, J., Stock, S., American academy of child and adolescent psychiatry (AACAP) committee on quality issues (CQI).

Weersink et al. (Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol, 2015) describe telephone calls to a national medicines information line, with a focus on queries related to antipsychotic medications. Their analysis of callers’ questions and concerns offers a valuable window into patient and caregiver perspectives. Given that many callers reported that they had not shared these concerns with a health care provider, this study also highlights the capacity of medication hotlines to address unmet needs. Establishing and maintaining long-term treatment regimens is a complex task, and truly patient-centered care requires a variety of creative and accessible support resources.

Studies show that both vastly affect the quality of life (QOL) of patients and cause great amount of disability. Objective: To evaluate and compare the QOL and Disability between patients with Schizophrenia and Dysthymia. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional, observational, comparative study was done in a randomly chosen sample of 30 outpatients each of schizophrenia and dysthymia. QOL was assessed using WHOQOL-BREF scale and disability was assessed using the Indian Disability Evaluation and Assessment Scale (IDEAS). Results: Patients of schizophrenia showed greater disability and poorer QOL than patients of dysthymia. The ‘Social Relationships’ domain of the WHOQOL-BREF scale was the worst affected domain in both groups of patients. Patients with dysthymia also did significantly (p=0.040) better in the ‘Psychological’ domain; while patients with schizophrenia were significantly (p=0.029) better in the ‘Physical Health’ domain. Patients with schizophrenia showed greater disability than patients with dysthymia in all the 4 domains of the IDEAS, significantly in the areas of Self care (p<0.001) and Communication-Understanding (p<0.001). Conclusion: Schizophrenia is a more debilitating disorder than Dysthymia. This assumes significance when planning rehabilitation models for these disorders. © 2015, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

Behavioural and computational studies of perceptual and higher cognitive functions that depend on these processes are outlined, and evidence that those functions and their neuronal mechanisms are impaired in schizophrenia is summarized. Finally, we compare and assess the long-term biological functions of contextual modulation at the level of computational theory as formalized by the theories of coherent infomax and free energy reduction. We conclude that those theories, together with the many empirical findings reviewed, show how contextual modulation at the neuronal level enables the cortex to flexibly adapt the use of its knowledge to current circumstances by amplifying and grouping relevant activities and by suppressing irrelevant activities. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Amplification; Cognitive coordination; Contextual modulation; Gestalt grouping; Predictive processing; Suppression","Adams, R.A., Stephan, K.E., Brown, H.R., Frith, C.D., Friston, K.J., The computational anatomy of psychosis (2013) Front.

In this work, we demonstrate the first analytical micro-system for real-time monitoring of clozapine serum levels. An electrochemical lab-on-A-chip is developed and integrated with a catechol-chitosan redox cycling system. The microfabricated device incorporates 4 electrochemical reaction chambers with the capability of analyzing microliter-volume samples. Integration of the catechol-chitosan film amplifies the clozapine oxidative signal and improves the signal-to-noise ratio, which addresses sensitivity and selectivity challenges. Optimization of the redox cycling system fabrication parameters and analysis of various electrochemical techniques and data processing approaches is implemented to maximize clozapine detection performance. The device is tested with buffer samples containing clozapine and demonstrates a sensitivity of 54 μC mL cm-2 μg-1 and a limit-of-detection of 0.8 μg mL-1, a sensing performance similar to a counterpart macro-scale benchtop system. Importantly, the feasibility to differentiate between 0.33 μg mL-1 and 3.27 μg mL-1 clozapine concentrations in human serum without any preceding dilution or filtering procedures is demonstrated, a significant step towards utilizing point-of-care testing micro-systems for schizophrenia treatment management. With these micro-systems, we envision more effective and safe treatment that will enable fewer visits to the clinicians, decrease costs and patient burden. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

They show variable clinical expressivity, being associated with different disorders, and incomplete penetrance. However, due to its very low frequency, the full variety of clinical outcomes associated with each one of these CNVs is unknown. Current methods for detection of CNVs are labor intensive, expensive or not suitable for high throughput analysis. Quantitative interspecies competitive PCR linked to variant minisequencing and detection by mass-spectrometry may overcome these limitations. Here, we present two multiplex assays based on this method to screen for eleven psychiatric risk CNVs, such as 1q21, 16p11.2, 3q29, or 16p13.11 regions, among others. The assays were tested in our collection of 514 schizophrenia patients. Results were compared with MLPA at two CNVs. Additional positive results were confirmed by exome sequencing. A total of fourteen patients were CNV carriers. The method presents high sensitivity and specificity, showing its utility as a cheap, accurate, high throughput screening tool for recurrent CNVs. The method may be very useful for management of psychiatric patients as well as screening of different collections of samples to better identify the full spectrum of clinical variability. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Autism; Copy number variants; Psychiatric genetics; Quantitative interspecies competitive PCR; Schizophrenia","Stefansson, H., Rujescu, D., Cichon, S., Large recurrent microdeletions associated with schizophrenia (2008) Nature, 455, pp. 232-236; Levinson, D.F., Duan, J., Oh, S., Copy number variants in schizophrenia: confirmation of five previous findings and new evidence for 3q29 microdeletions and VIPR2 duplications (2011) Am J Psychiatry, 168, pp. 302-316; Malhotra, D., Sebat, J., CNVs: harbingers of a rare variant revolution in psychiatric genetics (2012) Cell, 148, pp. 1223-1241; Kirov, G., Rees, E., Walters, J.T.R., The penetrance of copy number variations for schizophrenia and developmental delay (2013) Biol Psychiatry, 75, pp. 378-385; Rees, E., Moskvina, V., Owen, M.J., O'Donovan, M.C., Kirov, G., De novo rates and selection of schizophrenia-associated copy number variants (2011) Biol Psychiatry, 70, pp. 1109-1114; Rees, E., Walters, J.T.R., Georgieva, L., Analysis of copy number variations at 15 schizophrenia-associated loci (2014) Br J Psychiatry, 204, pp. 108-114; Girirajan, S., Campbell, C.D., Eichler, E.E., Human copy number variation and complex genetic disease (2011) Annu Rev Genet, 45, pp. 203-226; Costain, G., Lionel, A.C., Merico, D., Pathogenic rare copy number variants in community-based schizophrenia suggest a potential role for clinical microarrays (2013) Hum Mol Genet, 22, pp. 4485-4501; Aradhya, S., Cherry, A.M., Counting chromosomes to exons: advances in copy number detection (2013) Curr Genet Med Rep, 1, pp. 71-80; Williams, N.M., Williams, H., Majounie, E., Analysis of copy number variation using quantitative interspecies competitive PCR (2008) Nucleic Acids Res, 36, p. e112; Carrera, N., Arrojo, M., Sanjuán, J., Association study of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in schizophrenia (2012) Biol Psychiatry, 71, pp. 169-177; Vacic, V., McCarthy, S., Malhotra, D., Duplications of the neuropeptide receptor gene VIPR2 confer significant risk for schizophrenia (2011) Nature, 471, pp. 499-503; McKenna, A., Hanna, M., Banks, E., The genome analysis toolkit: a MapReduce framework for analyzing next-generation DNA sequencing data (2010) Genome Res, 20, pp. 1297-1303; Plagnol, V., Curtis, J., Epstein, M., A robust model for read count data in exome sequencing experiments and implications for copy number variant calling (2012) Bioinformatics, 28, pp. 2747-2754; Rees, E., Kirov, G., Sanders, A., Evidence that duplications of 22q11.2 protect against schizophrenia (2014) Mol Psychiatry, 19, pp. 37-40; Conrad, D.F., Pinto, D., Redon, R., Origins and functional impact of copy number variation in the human genome (2010) Nature, 464, pp. 704-712; Guha, S., Rees, E., Darvasi, A., Implication of a rare deletion at distal 16p11.2 in schizophrenia (2013) JAMA, Psychiatry, 70, pp. 253-260; Miller, D.T., Adam, M.P., Aradhya, S., Consensus statement: chromosomal microarray is a first-tier clinical diagnostic test for individuals with developmental disabilities or congenital anomalies (2010) Am J Hum Genet, 86, pp. 749-764; Van Den Bossche, M.J., Johnstone, M., Strazisar, M., Rare copy number variants in neuropsychiatric disorders: specific phenotype or not?

Being pathological is clearly distinguished from being false or being irrational. Anna might falsely believe that his husband is having an affair but it might just be a simple mistake. Again, Sam might irrationally believe, without good evidence, that he is smarter than his colleagues, but it might just be a healthy self-deceptive belief. On the other hand, when a patient with brain damage caused by a car accident believes that his father was replaced by an imposter or another patient with schizophrenia believes that ""The Organization"" painted the shops on a street in red and green to convey a message, these beliefs are not merely false or irrational. They are pathological. What makes delusions pathological? This paper explores the negative features because of which delusional beliefs are pathological. First, I critically examine the proposals according to which delusional beliefs are pathological because of (1) their strangeness, (2) their extreme irrationality, (3) their resistance to folk psychological explanations or (4) impaired responsibility-grounding capacities of people with them. I present some counterexamples as well as theoretical problems for these proposals. Then, I argue, following Wakefield's harmful dysfunction analysis of disorder, that delusional beliefs are pathological because they involve some sorts of harmful malfunctions. In other words, they have a significant negative impact on wellbeing (=harmful) and, in addition, some psychological mechanisms, directly or indirectly related to them, fail to perform the jobs for which they were selected in the past (=malfunctioning). An objection to the proposal is that delusional beliefs might not involve any malfunctions. For example, they might be playing psychological defence functions properly. Another objection is that a harmful malfunction is not sufficient for something to be pathological. For example, false beliefs might involve some malfunctions according to teleosemantics, a popular naturalist account of mental content, but harmful false beliefs do not have to be pathological. I examine those objections in detail and show that they should be rejected after all. © 2014.","Delusion; Harmful dysfunction analysis of disorder; Malfunction; Schizophrenia; Teleosemantics","(2013) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , American Psychiatric Publishing, Arlington, VA; Bentall, R.P., Kaney, S., Abnormalities of self-representation and persecutory delusions: A test of a cognitive model of paranoia (1996) Psychological Medicine, 26 (6), pp. 1231-1238; Bortolotti, L., (2010) Delusions and other irrational beliefs, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Bortolotti, L., Broome, M.R., Mameli, M., Delusions and responsibility for action: Insights from the Breivik case (2013) Neuroethics, , [Advance online publication]; Bortolotti, L., Mameli, M., Self-deception, delusion and the boundaries of folk psychology (2012) Humana Mente, 20, p. 203; Bourget, D., Whitehurst, L., Capgras syndrome; a review of the neurophysiological correlates and presenting clinical features in cases involving physical violence (2004) Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 14, pp. 719-725; Buller, D.J., Etiological theories of function: A geographical survey (1998) Biology & Philosophy, 13 (4), pp. 505-527; Buller, D.J., (2005) Adapting minds: Evolutionary psychology and the persistent quest for human nature, , The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Butler, P.V., Reverse Othello syndrome subsequent to traumatic brain injury (2000) Psychiatry, 63 (1), pp. 85-92; Chadwick, P.K., Psychotic consciousness (2001) International Journal of Social Psychiatry, 47 (1), pp. 52-62; Coltheart, M., Cognitive neuropsychiatry and delusional belief: The 33rd Sir Frederick Bartlett lecture (2007) The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 60 (8), pp. 1041-1062; Coltheart, M., Menzies, P., Sutton, J., Abductive inference and delusional belief (2010) Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, 15 (1-3), pp. 261-287; Corlett, P., Murray, G., Honey, G., Aitken, M., Shanks, D., Robbins, T., Disrupted prediction-error signal in psychosis: Evidence for an associative account of delusions (2007) Brain, 130 (9), pp. 2387-2400; Corlett, P., Taylor, J., Wang, X., Fletcher, P., Krystal, J., Toward a neurobiology of delusions (2010) Progress in Neurobiology, 92 (3), pp. 345-369; Davies, M., Coltheart, M., Langdon, R., Breen, N., Monothematic delusions: Towards a two-factor account (2001) Philosophy, Psychiatry, & Psychology, 8 (2), pp. 133-158; Dretske, F.I., (1991) Explaining behavior: Reasons in a world of causes, , The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Easton, J.A., Schipper, L.D., Shackelford, T.K., Why the adaptationist perspective must be considered: The example of morbid jealousy (2006) Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 29 (4), pp. 411-412; Easton, J.A., Schipper, L.D., Shackelford, T.K., Morbid jealousy from an evolutionary psychological perspective (2007) Evolution and Human Behavior, 28 (6), pp. 399-402; Ellis, H.D., Young, A.W., Accounting for delusional misidentifications (1990) The British Journal of Psychiatry, 157 (2), pp. 239-248; Ellis, H.D., Young, A.W., Quayle, A.H., De Pauw, K.W., Reduced autonomic responses to faces in Capgras delusion (1997) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Collectively these studies provide an overview of how utilization of predictive context changes as a function of stimulus modality and across different patient populations, as well as the networks that may be critical for this function. The following aspects of local contextual processing will be discussed and reviewed: (i) the correlates associated with contextual processing that have been identified in healthy adults, (ii) stimulus modality effects, (iii) specific alterations and deficits of local contextual processing in aging and across different neurological and psychiatric patient populations, including patients with prefrontal cortex lesions, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder, (iv) the potential for utilizing the correlates of local context as biomarkers for frontal cognitive dysfunction and (v) the role of frontal networks in the processing of contextual information. Overall findings show that behavioral and neural correlates associated with processing of local context are comparable across stimulus modalities, but show specific alterations in aging and across different neurological and psychiatric disorders. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Context; EEG; Frontal networks; Neural correlates; Prediction","Adams, R.A., Stephan, K.E., Brown, H.R., Frith, C.D., Friston, K.J., The computational anatomy of psychosis (2013) Front.

However, no robust global approach unambiguously identifies the common biological abnormalities in, for example, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in a number of mental disorders, where there are multiple datasets/attributes. Here we propose a novel and efficient statistical approach to this problem that finds common features in multiple datasets. New method: By collecting the statistics of each dataset into a vector, our method uses a 'multi-dimensional local false discovery' rate to pool information and make full use of the joint distribution of datasets. Results: We have tested our approach extensively on both simulated and clinical datasets. By conducting simulation studies, we find that our approach has a higher statistical power than existing approaches, especially on correlated datasets. Employing our approach on clinical data yields findings that are consistent with the existing literature. Comparison with existing methods: Conventional methods cannot determine the false discovery rate underlying multiple datasets/attributes. Our approach can effectively handle these datasets. It has a solid Bayesian interpretation, and a higher power than other approaches in numerical simulations. This can be explained by the incorporation of correlations, between different attributes, into the new method. Conclusions: In this work, we present a natural, novel and powerful statistical approach to tackle situations involving multiple datasets or attributes. This new method has significant advantages over existing approaches and wide applications. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Common; FMRI; Local false discovery rate; Resting-state functional connectivity","Adam, D., Mental health: on the spectrum (2013) Nature, 496, pp. 416-418; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) J R Statist Soc B, 57 (1), pp. 289-300; Benjamini, Y., Yekutieli, D., The control of the false discovery rate in multiple testing under dependency (2001) Ann Stat, 29, pp. 1165-1188; Borenstein, M., Hedges, L.V., Higgins, J.P.T., Rothstein, H.R., (2009) Introduction to Meta-Analysis, , John Wiley & Sons.

MethodsOLZ cytogenetic effects were investigated by evaluating the frequency of Sister Chromatid Exchanges (SCEs) and Proliferation Rate Index (PRI) in cultured lymphocytes of schizophrenic patients who were under treatment of OLZ. SCE estimation is one of the most sensitive biomarkers of potential cytotoxicity, while PRI is used as a valuable marker of cytostatic activity. ResultsOur results showed a statistically significant increase of SCEs in the cultured lymphocytes of patients (p <0,001) compared to the lymphocytes of healthy donors, a statistically significant increase of SCEs (p < 0.001) in the lymphocytes of smoker patients compared to those of non-smoker patients and a statistically significant increase of SCEs (p < 0.001) in the lymphocytes of chronic recipients of OLZ compared to those of the patients with recent initiation of treatment. We did not detect any statistically significant differences with respect to PRI between the various groups examined. ConclusionsOur results indicate a mild cytotoxic - but not cytostatic - effect of OLZ which was more prominent in smokers and in chronically treated patients. That effect should be taken into consideration by psychiatrists upon assessing the benefit/risk ratio of their prescriptions. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","cytogenetic activity; olanzapine; sister chromatid exchanges","Akritopoulou, K., Iakovidou-Kritsi, Z., Mioglou-Kalouptsi, E., Cytogenetic activity of diazepam in normal human lymphocyte cultures (2009) Genet Test Mol Biomarkers, 13, pp. 227-231; Bakopoulou, A., Mourelatos, D., Tsiftsoglou, A.S., Genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of different types of dental cement on normal cultured human lymphocytes (2009) Mutat Res, 672 (2), pp. 103-112; Brambilla, G., Mattioli, F., Martelli, A., Genotoxic and carcinogenic effects of antipsychotics and antidepressants (2009) Toxicology, 261, pp. 77-88; (2009), Eli Lilly and Company Olanzapine prescribing information.

The explanation of this high comorbidity has remained a scientific puzzle. We propose 'disrupted emotion processing' as a liability spectrum that underlies many different mental disorders. Emotion processing deficits have been reported in different disorders and result in difficulties in regulating emotions and at the perceptual level in attentional biases and impaired recognition of emotional expressions. This article provides a detailed overview of the literature on disrupted emotion processing in clinical groups on the behavioral and neurological level. In the discussion, the similarities and differences between these disorders are discussed in the context of common neuro-endocrine, genetic and environmental factors and ideas are put forward on how future research may advance. Most importantly, more interdisciplinary research is needed in which different techniques, tasks and clinical populations are combined to get a better understanding of disrupted emotion processing as a liability spectrum underlying various different mental disorders. © 2015.","Emotion perception; Emotion recognition; Emotion regulation; FMRI; Mental disorders","Adolphs, R., What does the amygdala contribute to social cognition?

Index tests included a parent report (a rationally derived scale from the Child Behavioral Checklist), a teacher report (the Teacher Report Form), and three youth reports—a PTSD scale from the Youth Self Report (YSR), Child PTSD Symptom Scale, and Child and Adolescent Trauma Survey. Interviews with the youth and caregiver using Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children generated criterion diagnoses of PTSD. Diagnoses were blind to scores on the index tests. Based on consensus diagnoses (N = 458), 10% of youth had PTSD. Area under the curve (AUC) from receiver operating characteristic analyses and multilevel likelihood ratios evaluated test performance. All youth reports (AUCs .67–.73) outperformed the teacher report (AUCs .42–.48) at identifying PTSD. The YSR outperformed the caregiver reports (AUCs .57–.58). Combining tests did not improve prediction of PTSD. The YSR predicted PTSD even after controlling for a self-reported traumatic event, but checklist ratings of traumatic events had no incremental value after controlling for YSR scores. When a youth endorsed few symptoms, the likelihood of the youth having PTSD was low. Very high scores on the YSR were associated with a moderate increase in the likelihood of PTSD diagnosis. The YSR appeared to be a useful diagnostic aid for youth PTSD and could facilitate differential diagnosis of youth PTSD in outpatient settings. 2015 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928999865

Low frequency rTMS and cathodal effect of tDCS inhibits cortical functioning while high frequency and anodal effect of tDCS have the opposite effect. Prolonged and repetitive application of either methods leads to changes in excitability of the human cortex that outlast the period of stimulation. Both rTMS and tDCS induce functional changes in the brain-modulating neural activity at cortical level. This paper reviews rTMS and tDCS effects in clinical trials for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Low frequency rTMS, particularly targeting the supplementary motor area and the orbital frontal cortex, seems to be the most promising in terms of therapeutic efficacy while older studies targeting the prefrontal dorsal cortex were not as successful. tDCS clearly needs to be investigated in large scale and sufficiently powered randomized control studies. From a general point of view, these non-invasive techniques hold promise as novel therapeutic tools for OCD patients. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder; rTMS; Stimulation; tDCS","Kumar, N., Chadda, R.K., Augmentation effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the supplementary motor cortex in the treatment of refractory patients with obsessive-compulsive disorders (2011) Indian J Psychiatry, 53 (4), pp. 340-342. , PID: 22303044; Mallet, L., Polosan, M., Jaafari, N., Baup, N., Welter, M.L., Fontaine, D., Subthalamic nucleus stimulation in severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (2008) N Engl J Med, 359 (20), pp. 2121-2134. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1cXhtlOrtLjI, PID: 19005196; Hummel, F., Celnik, P., Giraux, P., Floel, A., Wu, W.H., Gerloff, C., Effects of non-invasive cortical stimulation on skilled motor function in chronic stroke (2005) Brain, 128 (3), pp. 490-499. , PID: 15634731; Fregni, F., Boggio, P.S., Lima, M.C., Ferreira, M.J., Wagner, T., Rigonatti, S.P., A sham-controlled, phase II trial of transcranial direct current stimulation for the treatment of central pain in traumatic spinal cord injury (2006) Pain, 122 (1-2), pp. 197-209. , PID: 16564618; Boggio, P.S., Rigonatti, S.P., Ribeiro, R.B., Myczkowski, M.L., Nitsche, M.A., Pascual-Leone, A., A randomized, double-blind clinical trial on the efficacy of cortical direct current stimulation for the treatment of major depression (2008) Int J Neuropsychopharmacol, 11 (2), pp. 249-254. , PID: 17559710; George, M.S., Taylor, J.J., Short, E.B., The expanding evidence base for rTMS treatment of depression (2013) Curr Opin Psychiatry, 26 (1), pp. 13-18. , PID: 23154644; Antal, A., Nitsche, M.A., Paulus, W., Transcranial direct current stimulation and the visual cortex (2006) Brain Res Bull, 68 (6), pp. 459-463. , PID: 16459203; Fregni, F., Boggio, P.S., Nitsche, M.A., Marcolin, M.A., Rigonatti, S.P., Pascual-Leone, A., Treatment of major depression with transcranial direct current stimulation (2006) Bipolar Disord, 8 (2), pp. 203-204. , PID: 16542193; Hoffman, R.E., Gueorguieva, R., Hawkins, K.A., Varanko, M., Boutros, N.N., Wu, Y.T., Temporoparietal transcranial magnetic stimulation for auditory hallucinations: safety, efficacy and moderators in a fifty patient sample (2005) Biol Psychiatry, 58 (2), pp. 97-104. , PID: 15936729; Aleman, A., Sommer, I.E., Kahn, R.S., Efficacy of slow repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of resistant auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia: a meta-analysis (2007) J Clin Psychiatry, 68 (3), pp. 416-421. , PID: 17388712; Hallet, M., Transcranial magnetic stimulation and the human brain (2000) Nature, 406 (6792), pp. 147-150; Pascual-Leone, A., Tormos, J.M., Keenan, J., Tarazona, F., Canete, C., Catala, M.D., Study of modulation of human cortical excitability with transcranial magnetic stimulation (1998) J Clin Neurophysiol, 15 (4), pp. 333-343. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK1cvgsFyktg%3D%3D, PID: 9736467; Speer, A.M., Benson, B.E., Kimbrell, T.K., Wassermann, E.M., Willis, M.W., Herscovitch, P., Opposite effects of high and low frequency rTMS on mood in depressed patients: relationship to baseline cerebral activity on PET (2009) J Affect Disord, 115 (3), pp. 386-394. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD1MzhtFWqsQ%3D%3D, PID: 19027962; Siebner, H.R., Takano, B., Peinemann, A., Schwaiger, M., Conrad, B., Drzezga, A., Continuous transcranial magnetic stimulation during positron emission tomography: a suitable tool for imaging regional excitability of the human cortex (2001) Neurimage, 14 (4), pp. 883-890. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD3MrgslWmsg%3D%3D; Priori, A., Hallet, M., Rothwell, J.C., Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or trancranial direct current stimulation ?

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is another medical emergency which needs high degree of clinical suspicion else mortality can be high. There is a paradox in co existence of myxedema coma and NMS. While one is hypometabolic state another is hypermetabolic state and both can be precipitated by antipsychotics use. Hypothermia and flaccidity commonly expected in myxedema coma may mask fever and rigidity of classical NMS contributing to diagnostic problem and treatment delay. Scientific literature on coexistance of myxedema coma and NMS is sparse. We hereby report first case with coexisting myxedema coma and NMS in a patient of schizophrenia treated with antipsychotic, where classical symptoms of NMS were masked by myxedema coma. Prompt diagnosis and effective management by a team resulted in favourable outcome in our patient. This case is reported to alert intensive care physicians to atypical manifestations of NMS in presence of hypothyroidism. © 2015, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

However, its effect on Ca2+ signaling and cell viability remains controversial. This study focuses on how the type II positive allosteric modulator (PAM II) PNU120596 affects intracellular Ca2+ signaling and cell viability. We used human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells overexpressing α7-nAChRs (α7-SH) and their control (C-SH). We monitored cytoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ with Fura-2 and the genetically encoded cameleon targeting the ER, respectively. Nicotinic inward currents were measured using patch-clamp techniques. Viability was assessed using methylthiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide or propidium iodide staining. We observed that in the presence of a nicotinic agonist, PNU120596 (i) reduced viability of α7-SH but not of C-SH cells; (ii) significantly increased inward nicotinic currents and cytosolic Ca2+ concentration; (iii) released Ca2+ from the ER by a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism only in α7-SH cells; (iv) was cytotoxic in rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures; and, lastly, all these effects were prevented by selective blockade of α7-nAChRs, ryanodine receptors, or IP<inf>3</inf> receptors. In conclusion, positive allosteric modulation of α7-nAChRs with the PAM II PNU120596 can lead to dysregulation of ER Ca2+, overloading of intracellular Ca2+, and neuronal cell death. © 2015 International Society for Neurochemistry.","Ca2+; cytotoxicity; D1-ER cameleon probe; positive allosteric modulators; α7 nicotinic receptors","Akaike, A., Tamura, Y., Yokota, T., Shimohama, S., Kimura, J., Nicotine-induced protection of cultured cortical neurons against N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated glutamate cytotoxicity (1994) Brain Res., 644, pp. 181-187; Albuquerque, E.X., Santos, M.D., Alkondon, M., Pereira, E.F., Maelicke, A., Modulation of nicotinic receptor activity in the central nervous system: A novel approach to the treatment of Alzheimer disease (2001) Alzheimer Dis.

This study is based on a descriptive analysis of admission and discharge data of 1311 rehabilitation patients in the year 2010.Results: Nearly two thirds of the 1311 RPK rehabilitation patients met the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia or affective disorders. A subgroup of 39.1 % of all patients participated in vocational RPK measures (programs for participation in working life, LTA) after having received medical RPK measures. After completion of the vocational RPK measures 38 % of the rehabilitation patients were employed and 26 % were in education and retraining, i.e. 64 % of the patients were employed in the labor market or in educational measures. The housing and living conditions of the majority of patients changed in the direction of increased autonomy after completion of the RPK measures.Discussion and conclusion: For people with severe mental illnesses, RPKs can be a place of successful rehabilitative measures facilitating participation in community life. Future studies need to investigate predictors of outcome. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Employment market; Mentally ill persons; Occupational retraining; Rehabilitation; Rehabilitation centers for the mentally ill","Kranke, A.P., (2006) Personenzentrierte Hilfen im gemeindepsychiatrischen Verbund, , Psychiatrie-Verlag: Bonn; Bangen, R., Gobes, K., Berufliche rehabilitation: first place, then train – contra (2014) Psychiatr Prax, 41, pp. 295-296; Bond, G.R., Drake, R.E., Becker, D.R., An update on randomized controlled trials of evidence-based supported employment (2008) Psychiatr Rehabil J, 31, pp. 280-290; Brieger, P., Hoffmann, H., Was bringt psychisch Kranke nachhaltig in Arbeit? „Supported employment“ vs. „Pre-vocational training“ (2012) Nervenarzt, 83, pp. 840-846; Bühring, P., Pauschalierendes Entgeltsystem Psychiatrie und Psychosomatik (PEPP): Anreize zu verfrühter Entlassung (2014) Dtsch Arztebl 111:A-434/B-377/C-361; http://www.bagrpk.de/, Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft RPKBurns, T., Catty, J., Becker, T., The effectiveness of supported employment for people with severe mental illness: a randomised controlled trial (2007) Lancet, 370, pp. 1146-1152; Chilvers, R., Macdonald, G.M., Hayes, A.A., Supported housing for people with severe mental disorders (2006) Cochrane Database Syst Rev 18:CD000453; Psychiatrie, D.G., Psychotherapie, P.N., (2012) S3-Leitlinie Psychosoziale Therapien bei schweren psychischen Erkrankungen, , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg:; Hoffmann, H., Berufliche Rehabilitation: First place, then train – Pro (2014) Psychiatr Prax, 41, pp. 295-296; Hoffmann, H., Jäckel, D., Glauser, S., Long-term effectiveness of supported employment: five-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) account for a substantial portion of the total detected genetic variation in gene expression but how exactly variants acting in trans modulate gene expression and disease susceptibility remains largely unknown. The BDNF Val66Met SNP has been associated with a number of psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and related traits. Using global microRNA expression profiling in hippocampus of humanized BDNF Val66Met knock-in mice we showed that this variant results in dysregulation of at least one microRNA, which in turn affects downstream target genes. Specifically, we show that reduced levels of miR-146b (mir146b), lead to increased Per1 and Npas4 mRNA levels and increased Irak1 protein levels in vitro and are associated with similar changes in the hippocampus of hBDNFMet/Met mice. Our findings highlight trans effects of common variants on microRNA-mediated gene expression as an integral part of the genetic architecture of complex disorders and traits. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","BDNF; Knock-in mice; MicroRNA; Val66Met","Ambros, V., Bartel, B., Bartel, D.P., Burge, C.B., Carrington, J.C., Chen, X., Dreyfuss, G., Tuschl, T., A uniform system for microRNA annotation (2003) RNA, 9, pp. 277-279; Aston, C., Jiang, L., Sokolov, B.P., Microarray analysis of postmortem temporal cortex from patients with schizophrenia (2004) J.

While the same general principles apply to microRNA (miRNA) normalization, there is mounting evidence that global shifts in their expression patterns occur in specific circumstances, which pose a challenge for normalizing miRNA expression data. As an alternative to global normalization, which has the propensity to flatten large trends, normalization against constitutively expressed reference genes presents an advantage through their relative independence. Here we investigated the performance of reference-gene-based (RGB) normalization for differential miRNA expression analysis of microarray expression data, and compared the results with other normalization methods, including: quantile, variance stabilization, robust spline, simple scaling, rank invariant, and Loess regression. The comparative analyses were executed using miRNA expression in tissue samples derived from subjects with schizophrenia and non-psychiatric controls. We proposed a consistency criterion for evaluating methods by examining the overlapping of differentially expressed miRNAs detected using different partitions of the whole data. Based on this criterion, we found that RGB normalization generally outperformed global normalization methods. Thus we recommend the application of RGB normalization for miRNA expression data sets, and believe that this will yield a more consistent and useful readout of differentially expressed miRNAs, particularly in biological conditions characterized by large shifts in miRNA expression. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Bartel, D.P., (2004) Cell, 116, pp. 281-297; Pei, Y., Wang, X., Zhang, X., (2009) J.

Twenty-eight individuals with elevated schizotypal features and 20 healthy controls observed a series of images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and provided self-report ratings of affective valence and arousal while their physiological responses were recorded. The groups were evenly divided by sex. A three-way interaction in fEMG measurement revealed that while males with psychometrically defined schizotypy demonstrated the expected pattern of blunted/constricted facial affective expression relative to male controls in the context of negative images, females displayed the opposite pattern. That is, females with psychometrically defined schizotypy demonstrated significant elevations in negative facial affective expression relative to female controls while viewing negative images. We argue that these findings corroborate previously reported impressions of sex differences in affective expression in schizotypy. We discuss implications for assessment and diagnostic procedures among individuals with disorders along the schizophrenia spectrum. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Affective expression; Constricted affect; Facial EMG; Schizotypy; Sex differences",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928673742

Drug challenge studies suggest that glutamate neurotransmission plays an important role in modulating P3 ERP. However, while direct links between glutamate activity and P3 ERP response in humans are suspected, mechanistic details remain largely unknown. We investigated here the relationships between P3 ERP and indices of glutamatergic processing measured in vivo with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS). We hypothesized that a higher index of glutamatergic processing (glutamine/glutamate ratio; abbreviated Gln/Glu) in the anterior cingulate (ACC) and in the parietal-occipital (POC) cortices would associate with larger frontal P3a and parietal P3b amplitudes, respectively. Methods: Frontal P3a (Fz) and parietal P3b (Pz) were collected from 32 healthy participants who performed an auditory oddball task. Resting glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), and Gln/Glu (an index of glutamatergic processing) measures were obtained on a 4. T MR scanner using J-resolved MR spectroscopy. Linear regression and partial correlations were used for statistical analysis. Results: Significant positive correlations were found between frontal P3a amplitude and ACC Gln/Glu ratio (partial R= 0.57; P= 0.001) and between frontal P3a amplitude and ACC Gln concentration (partial R= 0.43; P= 0.02). Relationships between parietal P3b and the glutamate indices in the POC were not significant. Conclusions: These results indicate a specific connection between an index of glutamate neurotransmitter function in ACC and frontal P3 ERP, providing a novel insight into the neurochemistry underlying scalp recorded EEG response. Abnormalities in glutamate neurotransmission have been observed in schizophrenia and other psychiatric conditions and may underlie illness related deficits of P3 ERP. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Event-related potential; Glutamate; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS); P3","Bottomley, P.A., Spatial localization in NMR spectroscopy in vivo (1987) Ann.

Psychoeducation has been shown to reduce the number and duration of readmissions. Yet, only little more than 20% of psychiatric patients in German speaking countries receive psychoeducation. Among other reasons, costs may be considered too high by hospitals. The objective of the present study was to test the feasibility of a new cost-efficient approach in the psychoeducation of patients with schizophrenia. In this study, films were used to impart knowledge about the illness to inpatients. Methods: A total of 113 participants were initially included in the study, eleven of which were not included in the final analyses. Six films about the symptoms, diagnosis, causes, warning signs, treatment of schizophrenia and about the influence of family members and friends were shown in a group setting in the presence of nursing staff. All films combined facts, expert opinions, and personal experiences of peers. As the main outcome criterion of this feasibility pilot study, we measured the effects on knowledge. Secondary outcome measures included compliance, insight into illness, side effects, and quality of life. Data were collected directly after the intervention and about half a year afterwards. The number and the duration of readmissions to the hospital were recorded and compared to the number and duration of prior admissions. Patients were also asked to state their subjective opinion about the films. Main data analyses were done using paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Secondary analyses also involved ANOVAs and ANCOVAs. Results: One hundred and two inpatients were included in the data analyses. Showing the films in the tested setting was shown to be feasible. Knowledge about schizophrenia (p<.001), compliance (ps<.01), insight into illness (p<.01), and quality of life (p<.001) all increased significantly after patients had watched the films and remained stable for at least half a year. A vast majority (84.9%) of the patients found the films to be interesting and informative. Conclusions: Using films to educate inpatients about schizophrenia is a feasible method that is cost- and time-efficient and well received by the patients. © von Maffei et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Film; Group; Psychoeducation; Schizophrenia","Schooler, N.R., Relapse and rehospitalization: comparing oral and depot antipsychotics (2003) J Clin Psychiatry, 64, pp. 14-17; Kissling, W., Leucht, S., Results of treatment of schizophrenia: is the glass half full or half empty?

A widely used animal model of the schizophrenia involves the administration of ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, NMDA receptors noncompetitive antagonist, that induce symptoms such as schizophrenia. To clarify the molecular mechanism of schizophrenia induced by MD, we investigated alterations in energetic metabolism, oxidative stress and neurotrophic factor levels in the brain of rats following MD and/or a single administration of ketamine during adulthood. Male Wistar rats were subjected to MD for 10 days. Additionally, these animals received acute ketamine (5, 15 or 25 mg/kg by intraperitoneal route, i.p.) during adulthood, and 30 min later, they were killed and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the hippocampus and the striatum were removed for molecular analyses. Ketamine 25 mg/kg and/or MD and Ketamine 15 and 5 mg/kg with MD decreased the creatine kinase (CK) activity in the hippocampus. The enzyme activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in the Krebs cycle had increased in the striatum following the administration of ketamine 25 mg/kg, MD per se or MD plus ketamine 5 and 15 mg/kg. MD per se or MD combined with ketamine in different doses increased the activity of mitochondrial complexes. The PFC of animals subjected to MD and administered with ketamine 5 mg/kg exhibited increased protein carbonyl content. In the hippocampus, ketamine 15 mg/kg, ketamine 25 mg/kg and MD each increased the carbonyl content. In the striatum, the TBARS levels were increased by the administration of ketamine 25 mg/kg. Finally, in the hippocampus, MD alone or in combination with ketamine reduced the Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) levels; however, the Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels were unaltered. In the present study, we suggest that MD increased the risk of psychotic symptoms in adulthood, altering different parameters of energy and oxidative stress.

Mondino National Neurological InstitutePavia, Italy","The past 20 years have seen the evolution of the construct of a clinical high-risk (hereafter, HR) state for psychosis. This construct is designed to capture the pre-psychotic phase. Some aspects of this approach, such as its feasibility in children and adolescents, are still under investigation. In the present study, we address the feasibility of implementing prodrome clinics for HR individuals within the framework of Italy’s national child and adolescent neuropsychiatry services and the clinical relevance of a HR diagnosis in this population. Using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS) to identify help-seeking patients meeting at least one HR criterion at baseline (HR+), we recruited 50 subjects for a feasibility study. The results obtained show that the Italian version of the CAARMS is easily administrable, causing patients no substantial discomfort. The prevalence of HR+ in our cohort was 44 %, which increased by an additional 18 % when negative symptoms were considered as an experimental inclusion criterion (HRNeg). The HR+ subjects were significantly more impaired in their social and occupational functioning than their HR− peers (subjects not at HR). The cumulative 1-year transition risk of psychosis of the HR+ group was 26.7 %. When the HRNeg group was added, the 1-year transition risk was 17.3 %. We suggest that administration of the CAARMS to children and adolescents with putative prodromal psychosis is feasible and that this assessment can easily be integrated into existing Italian neuropsychiatry services although clinicians should interpret results with caution as results in this age group still have to be replicated. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Adolescents; Children; Psychosis; Psychosis risk; Schizophrenia",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928674404

Objectives: Although PET radioligands are now available for more than 40 CNS targets, at the initiation of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) “Novel Methods leading to New Medications in Depression and Schizophrenia” (NEWMEDS) in 2009, PET radioligands sensitive to an endogenous neurotransmitter were only validated for dopamine. NEWMEDS work-package 5, “Cross-species and neurochemical imaging (PET) methods for drug discovery”, commenced with a focus on developing methods enabling assessment of changes in extracellular concentrations of serotonin and noradrenaline in the brain. Results: Sharing the workload across institutions, we utilized in vitro techniques with cells and tissues, in vivo receptor binding and microdialysis techniques in rodents, and in vivo PET imaging in non-human primates and humans. Here, we discuss these efforts and review other recently published reports on the use of radioligands to assess changes in endogenous levels of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, γ-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, acetylcholine, and opioid peptides. The emphasis is on assessment of the availability of appropriate translational tools (PET radioligands, pharmacological challenge agents) and on studies in non-human primates and human subjects, as well as current challenges and future directions. Conclusions: PET imaging directed at investigating changes in endogenous neurochemicals, including the work done in NEWMEDS, have highlighted an opportunity to further extend the capability and application of this technology in drug development. © 2015 The Author(s)","Acetylcholine; Dopamine; GABA; Glutamate; Neurotransmitter; Non-human primate; Noradrenaline; PET imaging; Pharmacological challenge; Serotonin",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928612455

Few studies have examined the impact of parental psychopathology on depression rates in older age groups. Method: We established a population-based cohort including all individuals born in Denmark after 1954 and alive on their 10th birthday (N = 29 76 264). Exposure variables were maternal and paternal history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety or ‘other’ psychiatric diagnoses. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated using Poisson regressions. Results: Parental history of any psychiatric diagnosis increased incidence rates of outpatient (maternal: IRR 1.88, p < 0.0001; paternal: IRR 1.68, p < 0.0001) and inpatient (maternal: IRR 1.99, p < 0.0001; paternal: IRR 1.83, p < 0.0001) depression relative to no parental history. IRRs for parental history of non-affective disorders remained relatively stable across age groups, while IRRs for parental affective disorders (unipolar or bipolar) decreased with age from 2.29–3.96 in the youngest age group to 1.53–1.90 in the oldest group. IRR estimates for all parental diagnoses were similar among individuals aged ⩾41 years (IRR range 1.51–1.90). Conclusions: Parental history of any psychiatric diagnosis is associated with increased incidence rates of unipolar depression. In younger age groups, parental history of affective diagnoses is more strongly associated with rates of unipolar depression than non-affective diagnoses; however, this distinction disappears after age 40, suggesting that parental psychopathology in general, rather than any one disorder, confers risk for depression in middle life.

Guided by the extant factor analytic literature, the NIMH Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) initiative selected seven cognitive domains relevant to treatment studies in schizophrenia: speed of processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. These domains are assessed in the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). The aim of this study was to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the beta battery of the MCCB to compare the fit of the MATRICS consensus seven-domain model to other models in the current literature on cognition in schizophrenia. Method: Using data from 281 schizophrenia outpatients, we compared the seven correlated factors model with alternative models. Specifically, we compared the 7-factor model to (a) a single-factor model, (b) a three correlated factors model including speed of processing, working memory, and general cognition, and (c) a hierarchical model in which seven first-order factors loaded onto a second-order general cognitive factor. Results: Multiple fit indices indicated the seven correlated factors model was the best fit for the data and provided significant improvement in model fit beyond the comparison models. Conclusions: These results support the assessment of these seven cognitive dimensions in clinical trials of interventions to improve cognition in schizophrenia. Because these cognitive factors are separable to some degree, it is plausible that specific interventions may have differential effects on the domains.

Half of immersed corpses were suicidal, and nearly half of suicides had psychiatric disorders. 104 suicidal drownings with psychiatric disorders cases from 2010.1 to 2014.6 were reviewed (21.5% of all immersed corpses, 42.1% of suicides). Most victims clothed normally, and only 2 fastened attached weights. Male victims were more and younger than female. Psycho were prone to commit suicidal drowning in warm and hot season. Psycho were prone to choose familiar area to commit suicide, 45 decedents were found in their familiar areas. Suicidal drowings were occult without suicide attempts, suicide note or abnormal clothing, but showed abnormal mental or behavior changes prior to suicide. The three leading psychiatric disorders were depression (33.7%), depression status (30.8%) and schizophrenia (20.2%). Only 44.2% decedents had visited psychiatric disorder specialist, and merely less than 10% patients could adhere to regular medication. No regular medication on psychiatric disorder was the key factor contributing to high incidence of suicide in psycho. Professional psychiatric and psychological intervention should be taken as soon as possible when they had psychiatric symptoms or suffered misfortune. Guardians should be alert to patients' abnormality to detect their suicidal ideation and intervene, especially in warm season. © 2015 Fang et al.",,"He, M., Li, W.C., Sun, D.M., Ma, K.J., Zhao, Z.Q., Li, B.X., Epitome of China's Unnatural Deaths: A Historically Retrospective Study of Forensic Autopsy Cases in Shanghai Public Security Bureau From 1990 to 1999 (2014) Am J Forensic Med Pathol, 35, pp. 218-221. , PMID: 25084321; Lopez-Morinigo, J.D., Fernandes, A.C., Chang, C.K., Hayes, R.D., Broadbent, M., Stewart, R., Suicide completion in secondary mental healthcare: A comparison study between schizophrenia spectrum disorders and all other diagnoses (2014) BMC Psychiatry, 14, p. 213. , PMID: 25085220; Phillips, M.R., Li, X., Zhang, Y., Suicide rates in China, 1995-99 (2002) Lancet, 359, pp. 835-840. , PMID: 11897283; Cavanagh, J.T., Carson, A.J., Sharpe, M., Lawrie, S.M., Psychological autopsy studies of suicide: A systematic review (2003) Psychol Med, 33, pp. 395-405. , PMID: 12701661; Hawton, K., Harriss, L., Hall, S., Simkin, S., Bale, E., Bond, A., Deliberate self-harm in Oxford, 1990-2000: A time of change in patient characteristics (2003) Psychol Med, 33, pp. 987-995. , PMID: 12946083; Brown, S., Excess mortality of schizophrenia.

Compounds with purine-2,4-dione nucleus generally had affinity values higher than the corresponding purine-2,4,8-trione compounds. A spectrum of receptor activities was observed for compounds with a substituent at the 7-position of the imidazo[2,1-f]purine-2,4-dione system and some potent 5-HT1A (18, 25), 5-HT7 (14) and mixed 5-HT1A/5-HT7 (8, 9) receptor ligands with additional affinity for dopamine D2 receptors (15) has been identified. Moreover, docking studies proved that a substituent at the 7-position of 1,3-dimethyl-(1H,8H)-imidazo[2,1-f]purine-2,4-dione could be essential for receptor affinity and selectivity, especially towards 5-HT1A and 5-HT7.

Reduced levels of SP4 protein have recently been reported in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in first-episode psychosis. Also, SP4 levels are modulated by lithium treatment in cultured neurons. Phosphorylation of SP4 at S770 is increased in the cerebellum of bipolar disorder subjects and upon inhibition of NMDA receptor signaling in cultured neurons. The aim of this study was to investigate whether SP4 S770 phosphorylation is increased in lymphocytes of first-episode psychosis patients and the effect of lithium treatment on this phosphorylation. Methods: A cross-sectional study of S770 phosphorylation relative to total SP4 immunoreactivity using specific antibodies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in first-episode psychosis patients (n = 14, treated with lithium or not) and matched healthy controls (n = 14) by immunoblot was designed. We also determined the effects of the prescribed drugs lithium, olanzapine or valproic acid on SP4 phosphorylation in rat primary cultured cerebellar granule neurons. Results: We found that SP4 S770 phosphorylation was significantly increased in lymphocytes in first-episode psychosis compared to controls and decreased in patients treated with lithium compared to patients who did not receive lithium. Moreover, incubation with lithium but not olanzapine or valproic acid reduced SP4 phosphorylation in rat cultured cerebellar granule neurons. Conclusions: The findings presented here indicate that SP4 S770 phosphorylation is increased in lymphocytes in first-episode psychosis which may be reduced by lithium treatment in patients. Moreover, our study shows lithium treatment prevents this phosphorylation in vitro in neurons. This pilot study suggests that S770 SP4 phosphorylation could be a peripheral biomarker of psychosis, and may be regulated by lithium treatment in first-episode psychosis. © 2015 Pinacho et al.",,"Suske, G., The Sp-family of transcription factors (1999) Gene, 238 (2), pp. 291-300. , PMID: 10570957; Mao, X., Yang, S.H., Simpkins, J.W., Barger, S.W., Glutamate receptor activation evokes calpain-mediated degradation of Sp3 and Sp4, the prominent Sp-family transcription factors in neurons (2007) J Neurochem, 100 (5), pp. 1300-1314. , PMID: 17316402; Supp, D.M., Witte, D.P., Branford, W.W., Smith, E.P., Potter, S.S., Sp4, a member of the Sp1-family of zinc finger transcription factors, is required for normal murine growth, viability, and male fertility (1996) Dev Biol, 176 (2), pp. 284-299. , PMID: 8660867; Hagen, G., Muller, S., Beato, M., Suske, G., Cloning by recognition site screening of two novel GT box binding proteins: A family of Sp1 related genes (1992) Nucleic Acids Res, 20 (21), pp. 5519-5525. , PMID: 1454515; Ramos, B., Gaudilliere, B., Bonni, A., Gill, G., Transcription factor Sp4 regulates dendritic patterning during cerebellar maturation (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 104 (23), pp. 9882-9887. , PMID: 17535924; Zhou, X., Qyang, Y., Kelsoe, J.R., Masliah, E., Geyer, M.A., Impaired postnatal development of hippocampal dentate gyrus in Sp4 null mutant mice (2007) Genes Brain Behav, 6 (3), pp. 269-276. , PMID: 16899055; Zhou, X., Long, J.M., Geyer, M.A., Masliah, E., Kelsoe, J.R., Wynshaw-Boris, A., Reduced expression of the Sp4 gene in mice causes deficits in sensorimotor gating and memory associated with hippocampal vacuolization (2005) Mol Psychiatry, 10 (4), pp. 393-406. , PMID: 15558077; Zhou, X., Nie, Z., Roberts, A., Zhang, D., Sebat, J., Malhotra, D., Reduced NMDAR1 expression in the Sp4 hypomorphic mouse may contribute to endophenotypes of human psychiatric disorders (2010) Hum Mol Genet, 19 (19), pp. 3797-3805. , PMID: 20634195; Zhou, X., Tang, W., Greenwood, T.A., Guo, S., He, L., Geyer, M.A., Transcription factor SP4 is a susceptibility gene for bipolar disorder (2009) PLoS One, 4 (4), p. e5196. , PMID: 19401786; Tam, G.W., Van De Lagemaat, L.N., Redon, R., Strathdee, K.E., Croning, M.D., Malloy, M.P., Confirmed rare copy number variants implicate novel genes in schizophrenia (2010) Biochem Soc Trans, 38 (2), pp. 445-451. , PMID: 20298200; Pinacho, R., Villalmanzo, N., Lalonde, J., Haro, J.M., Meana, J.J., Gill, G., The transcription factor SP4 is reduced in postmortem cerebellum of bipolar disorder subjects: Control by depolarization and lithium (2011) Bipolar Disord, 13 (5-6), pp. 474-485. , PMID: 22085477; Pinacho, R., Villalmanzo, N., Roca, M., Iniesta, R., Monje, A., Haro, J.M., Analysis of Sp transcription factors in the postmortem brain of chronic schizophrenia: A pilot study of relationship to negative symptoms (2013) J Psychiatr Res, 47 (7), pp. 926-934. , PMID: 23540600; Pinacho, R., Valdizan, E.M., Pilar-Cuellar, F., Prades, R., Tarrago, T., Haro, J.M., Increased SP4 and SP1 transcription factor expression in the postmortem hippocampus of chronic schizophrenia (2014) J Psychiatr Res, 58, pp. 189-196. , PMID: 25175639; Jentsch, J.D., Roth, R.H., The neuropsychopharmacology of phencyclidine: From NMDA receptor hypofunction to the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia (1999) Neuropsychopharmacology, 20 (3), pp. 201-225. , PMID: 10063482; Krystal, J.H., Karper, L.P., Seibyl, J.P., Freeman, G.K., Delaney, R., Bremner, J.D., Subanesthetic effects of the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, ketamine, in humans.

Loss of parvalbumin (PV)-immunoreactive interneurons (PV-IN) in the brain cortex is an important feature of psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia. Here we investigate the causal contribution of oxidative stress in the brain cortex to neuropathological alterations in a mouse model of sleep apnea. Wild-type (WT) and the NADPH-oxidase-2 (gp91-phox/NOX2) knock-out adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to intermittent hypoxia (IH) or standard room air in the same chamber. In vivo we determined the impact (1) of IH exposures on NOX2 expression, (2) of genetic gp91-phox/NOX2 knock-out and (3) of pharmacological NOX2 inhibition on IH-induced neuropathological alterations in adult mice. Endpoints were oxidative stress, PV-IN and neurobehavioral alterations. The results showed IH exposures increased NOX2 expression in the prefrontal cortex of WT mice, which was accompanied with elevations of indirect markers of oxidative stress (HNE, HIF-1α, 8-OHDG). WT mice showed loss of PV-IN in the prefrontal cortex and increased locomotion activity and anxiety levels after exposed to IH, while no change emerged in NOX2 knock-out mice. Treatment of WT mice with the antioxidant/NOX inhibitor apocynin prevented the neuropathological and neurobehavioral alterations induced by IH exposures. Our data suggest that NOX2-derived oxidative stress is involved in the loss of PV-IN in the prefrontal cortex and development of neurobehavioral alterations for adult mice exposed to IH. These results provide a molecular mechanism for the coupling between sleep apnea and brain oxidative stress as well as potential new therapeutic avenues. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Intermittent hypoxia; NADPH-oxidase-2; Neurobehavioral alterations; Oxidative stress; PV-immunoreactive interneurons",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928399251

Sixty-four mothers were recruited from a Mother and Baby Unit and local children’s centres. A 5-min mother-infant interaction was coded on a number of caregiving variables. Affect recognition and discrimination abilities were tested via a series of computerised tasks. Group differences were found both in measures of affect recognition and in the mother-infant interaction. Mothers with schizophrenia showed consistent impairments across most of the parenting measures and all measures of affect recognition and discrimination. Mothers with depression fell between the mothers with schizophrenia and healthy controls on most measures. However, depressed women’s parenting was not significantly poorer than controls on any of the measures, and only showed trends for differences with mothers with schizophrenia on a few measures. Regression analyses found impairments in affect recognition and a diagnosis of schizophrenia to predict the occurrence of odd or unusual speech in the mother-infant interaction. Results add to the growing body of knowledge on the mother-infant interaction in mothers with schizophrenia and mothers with depression compared to healthy controls, suggesting a need for parenting interventions aimed at mothers with these conditions. While affect recognition impairments were not found to fully explain differences in parenting among women with schizophrenia, further research is needed to understand the psychopathology of parenting disturbances within this clinical group. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Wien","Affect recognition; Mother-infant interaction; Parenting; Postnatal depression; Schizophrenia",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928310758

We investigated the impact of protein-coding genes known to be involved in pruning, collected by a systematic literature research, in shaping the risk for SKZ in a case–control sample of 9,490 subjects (Psychiatric Genomics Consortium). Moreover, their modifications through evolution (humans, chimpanzees, and rats) and subcellular localization (as indicative of their biological function) were also investigated. We also performed a biological pathways (Gene Ontology) analysis. Genetics analyses found four genes (DLG1, NOS1, THBS4, and FADS1) and 17 pathways strongly involved in pruning and SKZ in previous literature findings to be significantly associated with the sample under analysis. The analysis of the subcellular localization found that secreted genes, and so regulatory ones, are the least conserved through evolution and also the most associated with SKZ. Their cell line and regional brain expression analysis found that their areas of primary expression are neuropil and the hippocampus, respectively. At the best of our knowledge, for the first time, we were able to describe the SKZ neurodevelopmental hypothesis starting from a single biological process. We can also hypothesize how alterations in pruning fine regulation and orchestration, strongly related with the evolutionary newest (and so more sensitive) secreted proteins, may be of particular relevance in the hippocampus. This early alteration may lead to a mis-structuration of neural connectivity, resulting in the different brain alteration that characterizes SKZ patients. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Comparative genomics; Enrichment analysis; Etiopathogenesis; Evolutive genetics; Gene set; Genetics; Molecular pathways; Pruning; Schizophrenia",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928350957

An automated touch screen-based rodent PAL (rPAL) task has been developed and is sensitive to manipulations of the dopaminergic and glutamatergic system. Accordingly, rPAL when used with pharmacological models of schizophrenia, like NMDA receptor blockade with MK-801 or dopaminergic stimulation with amphetamine, may have utility as a translational model of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine if amphetamine- and MK-801-induced impairment represent distinct models of cognitive impairment by testing their sensitivity to common antipsychotics and determine the relative contributions of D1 versus D2 receptors on performance of PAL. Method: Rats were trained in rPAL and were then treated with MK-801, amphetamine, risperidone, haloperidol, quinpirole, SK-82958, or SCH-23390 alone and in combination. Results: While both amphetamine and MK-801 caused clear impairments in accuracy, MK-801 induced a profound “perseverative” type behavior that was more pronounced when compared to amphetamine. Moreover, amphetamine-induced impairments, but not the effects of MK-801, could be reversed by antipsychotics as well as the D1 receptor antagonist SCH-23390, suggesting a role for both the D1 and D2 receptor in the amphetamine impairment model. Conclusions: These data suggest that amphetamine and MK-801 represent dissociable models of impairment in PAL, dependent on different underlying neurobiology. The ability to distinguish dopaminergic versus glutamatergic effects on performance in rPAL makes it a unique and useful tool in the modeling of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Dopamine receptor; Memory; NMDA receptor; Operant; PAL; Schizophrenia; Touch screen",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928320857

Although its function has not been well-characterized, ZNF804A contains a C2H2-type zinc-finger domain, suggesting that it has DNA binding properties, and consequently, a role in regulating gene expression. To further explore the role of ZNF804A on gene expression and its downstream targets, we used a gene knockdown (KD) approach to reduce its expression in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). KD was accomplished by RNA interference (RNAi) using lentiviral particles containing shRNAs that target ZNF804A mRNA. Stable transduced NPC lines were generated after puromycin selection. A control cell line expressing a random (scrambled) shRNA was also generated. Neuronal differentiation was induced, RNA was harvested after 14 days and transcriptome analysis was carried out using RNA-seq. 1815 genes were found to be differentially expressed at a nominally significant level (p<0.05); 809 decreased in expression in the KD samples, while 1106 increased. Of these, 370 achieved genome wide significance (FDR<0.05); 125 were lower in the KD samples, 245 were higher. Pathway analysis showed that genes involved in interferon-signaling were enriched among those that were down-regulated in the KD samples. Correspondingly, ZNF804A KD was found to affect in-terferon- alpha 2 (IFNA2)-mediated gene expression. The findings suggest that ZNF804A may affect a differentiating neuron's response to inflammatory cytokines, which is consistent with models of SZ and ASD that support a role for infectious disease, and/or autoimmunity in a subgroup of patients. © 2015 Chen et al.",,"Riley, B., Thiselton, D., Maher, B.S., Bigdeli, T., Wormley, B., Replication of association between schizophrenia and ZNF804A in the irish case-control study of schizophrenia sample (2010) Mol Psychiatry, 15, pp. 29-37. , PMID: 19844207;

Previous studies on iPSC-derived neuronal cells have reported the functional characterisation of a variety of receptors and ion channels, including glutamate receptors, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and several voltage-gated ion channels. In the present study we have examined the expression and functional properties of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in human iPSC-derived neurons. Gene expression analysis indicated the presence of transcripts encoding several nAChR subunits, with highest levels detected for α3-α7, β1, β2 and β4 subunits (encoded by CHRNA3-CHRNA7, CHRNB1, CHRNB2 and CHRNB4 genes). In addition, similarly high transcript levels were detected for the truncated dupα7 subunit transcript, encoded by the partially duplicated gene CHRFAM7A, which has been associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. The functional properties of these nAChRs have been examined by calcium fluorescence and by patch-clamp recordings. The data obtained suggest that the majority of functional nAChRs expressed in these cells have pharmacological properties typical of α7 receptors. Large responses were induced by a selective α7 agonist (compound B), in the presence of the α7-selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) PNU-120596, which were blocked by the α7-selective antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA). In addition, a small proportion of the neurons express nAChRs with properties typical of heteromeric (non-α7 containing) nAChR subtypes. These cells therefore represent a great tool to advance our understanding of the properties of native human nAChRs, α7 in particular. © 2015 Chatzidaki et al.",,"Millar, N.S., Assembly and subunit diversity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (2003) Biochem Soc Trans, 31, pp. 869-874. , PMID: 12887324;

These phenomena can lead to harmful behaviors, including violence, and thus represent a serious public health concern. Such violence is often a reason for psychiatric hospitalization, and it often leads to prolonged hospital stays, suffering by patients and their victims, and increased stigmatization. Despite the attention paid to violence, little is understood about its neural basis in schizophrenia. On a psychological level, aggression in schizophrenia has been primarily attributed to psychotic symptoms, desires for instrumental gain, or impulsive responses to perceived personal slights. Often, multiple attributions can coexist during a single aggressive incident. In this review, I discuss the neural circuitry associated with impulsivity and aggression in schizophrenia, with an emphasis on implications for treatment. Impulsivity appears to account for a great deal of aggression in schizophrenia, especially in inpatient settings. Urgency, defined as impulsivity in the context of strong emotion, is the primary focus of this article. It is elevated in several psychiatric disorders, and in schizophrenia, it has been related to aggression. Many studies have implicated dysfunctional frontotemporal circuitry in impulsivity and aggression in schizophrenia, and pharmacological treatments may act via that circuitry to reduce urgency and aggressive behaviors; however, more mechanistic studies are critically needed. Recent studies point toward manipulable neurobehavioral targets and suggest that cognitive, pharmacological, neuromodulatory, and neurofeedback treatment approaches can be developed to ameliorate urgency and aggression in schizophrenia. It is hoped that these approaches will improve treatment efficacy. © Cambridge University Press 2015","aggression; Functional connectivity; impulsivity; MRI; neuroimaging; schizophrenia; treatment; urgency; violence",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928242394

The aim of the Prevention Of Psychosis (POP) study is to reduce the annual incidence of psychotic disorders in a catchment area population through detection and intervention in the prodromal phase of disorder. Prodromal patients will be recruited through information campaigns modelled on the Scandinavian early Treatment and Intervention in Psychosis (TIPS) study and assessed by low-threshold detection teams. Methods/Design: The study will use a parallel control design comparing the incidence of first episode psychotic disorders between two Norwegian catchment areas with prodromal detection and treatment (Stavanger and Fonna) with two catchment areas without a prodromal intervention program (Bergen and Østfold). The primary aim of the current study is to test the effect of a Prodromal Detection and Treatment program at the health care systems level. The study will investigate: 1) If the combination of information campaigns and detection teams modelled will help in identifying individuals (age 13-65, fulfilling study inclusion criteria) at high risk of developing psychosis early, and 2) If a graded, multi-modal treatment program will reduce rates of conversion compared to the rates seen in follow-along assessments. Discussion: Positive results could potentially revolutionize therapy by treating risk earlier rather than disorder later and could open a new era of early detection and intervention in psychosis. Negative results will suggest that the potential for psychosis is determined early in life and that research should focus more on genetically linked neurodevelopmental processes. If we can identify people about to become psychotic with high accuracy, we can track them to understand more about how psychosis unfolds. Appropriate intervention at this stage could also prevent or delay the onset of psychosis and/or subsequent deterioration, i.e., social and instrumental disability, suicide, aggressive behavior, affective- and cognitive deficits. © Joa et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Early detection; Prodromal; Psychosis; Schizophrenia; Ultra-high risk","Melle, I., Larsen, T.K., Haahr, U., Friis, S., Johannessen, J.O., Opjordsmoen, S., Reducing the duration of untreated first-episode psychosis: effects on clinical presentation (2004) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 61 (2), pp. 143-150; Johannessen, J.O., McGlashan, T.H., Larsen, T.K., Horneland, M., Joa, I., Mardal, S., Early detection strategies for untreated first-episode psychosis (2001) Schizophr Res, 51 (1), pp. 39-46; Hegelstad, W.T., Larsen, T.K., Auestad, B., Evensen, J., Haahr, U., Joa, I., Long-term follow-up of the TIPS early detection in psychosis study: effects on 10-year outcome (2012) Am J Psychiatry, 169 (4), pp. 374-380; Thompson, P.M., Stein, J.L., Medland, S.E., Hibar, D.P., Vasquez, A.A., Renteria, M.E., The ENIGMA Consortium: large-scale collaborative analyses of neuroimaging and genetic data (2014) Brain Imaging Behav, 8 (2), pp. 153-182; Reay, R., Mitford, E., McCabe, K., Paxton, R., Turkington, D., Incidence and diagnostic diversity in first-episode psychosis (2010) Acta Psychiatr Scand, 121 (4), pp. 315-319; Melle, I., Johannesen, J.O., Friis, S., Haahr, U., Joa, I., Larsen, T.K., Early detection of the first episode of schizophrenia and suicidal behavior (2006) Am J Psychiatry, 163 (5), pp. 800-804; Larsen, T.K., Melle, I., Auestad, B., Haahr, U., Joa, I., Johannessen, J.O., Early detection of psychosis: positive effects on 5-year outcome (2011) Psychol Med, 41 (7), pp. 1461-1469; Melle, I., Larsen, T.K., Haahr, U., Friis, S., Johannesen, J.O., Opjordsmoen, S., Prevention of negative symptom psychopathologies in first-episode schizophrenia: two-year effects of reducing the duration of untreated psychosis (2008) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 65 (6), pp. 634-640; Fusar-Poli, P., Bonoldi, I., Yung, A.R., Borgwardt, S., Kempton, M.J., Valmaggia, L., Predicting psychosis: meta-analysis of transition outcomes in individuals at high clinical risk (2012) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 69 (3), pp. 220-229; Yung, A.R., McGorry, P.D., The prodromal phase of first-episode psychosis: past and current conceptualizations (1996) Schizophr Bull, 22 (2), pp. 353-370; Miller, T.J., McGlashan, T.H., Rosen, J.L., Cadenhead, K., Cannon, T., Ventura, J., Prodromal assessment with the structured interview for prodromal syndromes and the scale of prodromal symptoms: predictive validity, interrater reliability, and training to reliability (2003) Schizophr Bull, 29 (4), pp. 703-715; McFarlane, W.R., Cook, W.L., Downing, D., Verdi, M.B., Woodberry, K.A., Ruff, A., Portland identification and early referral: a community-based system for identifying and treating youths at high risk of psychosis (2010) Psychiatr Serv, 61 (5), pp. 512-515; Yung, A.R., Phillips, L.J., McGorry, P.D., McFarlane, C.A., Francey, S., Harrigan, S., Prediction of psychosis.

Participants include 14 patients in psychiatric treatment in Norway and 15 students at schools for adults with mental illnesses in Denmark. All participants were diagnosed with severe mental disorders persisting for a minimum of two years and with pronounced impact on daily living. Data were collected through qualitative interviews on two occasions 6–8 months apart for most participants. The findings and interpretations showed that the two groups of informants described their lives quite differently. Patients described a focus on receiving treatment for their disease, few stable and mutual relations, and a generally low quality of life, whereas students described a focus on social relations, interests and personal growth. Students also described a higher quality of life, little loneliness and greater satisfaction with life. This suggests that the main problem for many patients struggling with persistent and severe mental illness might not be the illness itself, but a lack of environmental conditions supporting personal development. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","developmental psychology; experience of using service; qualitative research; schizophrenia psychosocial treatment; treatment outcome research",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928395253

This study explored attitudes towards psychiatric coercive interventions in healthy individuals and persons suffering from schizophrenia, schizoaffective or bipolar disorder. The impact of personal history of coercive treatment on preferences concerning clinical management of patients unable to consent was investigated. Six case vignettes depicting scenarios of ethical dilemmas and demanding decisions in favour of or against coercive interventions were presented to 60 healthy volunteers and 90 patients. Structured interviews focusing on experienced coercion were performed in conjunction with the Coercion Experience Scale and the Admission Experience Survey. Symptom severity, psychosocial functioning and insight into illness were assessed as influencing variables. Student’s t tests compared patients’ and controls’ judgments, followed by regression analyses to define the predictive value of symptoms and measures of coercion on judgments regarding the total patient sample and patients with experience of fixation. Patients and non-psychiatric controls showed no significant difference in their attitudes towards involuntary admission and forced medication. Conversely, patients more than controls significantly disapproved of mechanical restraint. Subjective experience of coercive interventions played an important role for the justification of treatment against an individual’s “natural will”. Factors influencing judgments on coercion were overall functioning and personal experience of treatment effectiveness and fairness. Qualitative and quantitative aspects of perceived coercion, in addition to insight into illness, predicted judgments of previously fixated patients. Results underline the importance of the quality of practical implementation and care, if coercive interventions cannot be avoided. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Coercion; Consumers’ perspective; Fixation; Insight into illness; Involuntary treatments; Natural will",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928152403

Because the evidence on current psychopharmacological treatments is unclear, the authors reviewed the findings published to date by searching PubMed with the keywords negative symptoms, antipsychotics, antidepressants, glutamatergic compounds, monotherapy and add-on therapy and identifying additional articles in the reference lists of the resulting publications. The findings presented here predominantly focus on results of meta-analyses. Evidence for efficacy of current psychopharmacological medications is difficult to assess because of methodological problems and inconsistent results. In general, the second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) do not appear to have good efficacy in negative symptoms, although some show better efficacy than first-generation antipsychotics, some of which also demonstrated efficacy in negative symptoms. Specific trials on predominant persistent negative symptoms are rare and have been performed with only a few SGAs. More often, trials on somewhat persistent negative symptoms evaluate add-on strategies to ongoing antipsychotic treatment. Such trials, mostly on modern antidepressants, have demonstrated some efficacy. Several trials with small samples have evaluated add-on treatment with glutamatergic compounds, such as the naturally occurring amino acids glycine and d-serine and new pharmacological compounds. The results are highly inconsistent, although overall efficacy results appear to be positive. The unsatisfactory and inconsistent results can be partially explained by methodological problems. These problems need to be solved in the future, and the authors propose some possible solutions.

Shared features may be most prevalent among SZ and BD with a history of psychosis. This study extended this literature by examining reinforcement learning (RL) performance in individuals with SZ (n = 29), BD with a history of psychosis (BD+; n = 24), BD without a history of psychosis (BD?; n = 23), and healthy controls (HC; n = 24). RL was assessed through a probabilistic stimulus selection task with acquisition and test phases. Computational modeling evaluated competing accounts of the data. Each participant's trial-by-trial decision-making behavior was fit to 3 computational models of RL: (a) a standard actor-critic model simulating pure basal ganglia-dependent learning, (b) a pure Q-learning model simulating action selection as a function of learned expected reward value, and © a hybrid model where an actor-critic is ""augmented"" by a Q-learning component, meant to capture the top-down influence of orbitofrontal cortex value representations on the striatum. The SZ group demonstrated greater reinforcement learning impairments at acquisition and test phases than the BD+, BD?, and HC groups. The BD+ and BD? groups displayed comparable performance at acquisition and test phases. Collapsing across diagnostic categories, greater severity of current psychosis was associated with poorer acquisition of the most rewarding stimuli as well as poor go/no-go learning at test. Model fits revealed that reinforcement learning in SZ was best characterized by a pure actor-critic model where learning is driven by prediction error signaling alone. In contrast, BD?, BD+, and HC were best fit by a hybrid model where prediction errors are influenced by top-down expected value representations that guide decision making. These findings suggest that abnormalities in the reward system are more prominent in SZ than BD; however, current psychotic symptoms may be associated with reinforcement learning deficits regardless of a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Edition; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) diagnosis.

Systemic E2 enhances prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex, an operational measure of sensorimotor gating known to be impaired in schizophrenia and related disorders. However, the relative contribution of different estrogen-receptor (ER) isoforms in these associations still awaits examination. Objectives: The present study explored the effects of ER-α and ER-β stimulation or blockade on PPI and their functional relevance in an amphetamine-induced PPI deficiency model in male mice. Methods: Prior to the assessment of PPI, C57BL/6N male mice were injected with the ER-α agonist 4,4′,4″-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl) trisphenol (PPT), the ER-α antagonist 1,3-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methyl-5-[4-(2-piperidinylethoxy) phenol]-1N-pyrozole dihydrochloride (MPP), the ER-β agonist 2,3-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN), or the ER-β antagonist 4-[2-phenyl-5,7-bis (trifluoromethyl) pyrazolo [1,5-a] pyrimidin-3-yl] phenol (PHTPP), with or without concomitant amphetamine treatment. Results: Acute pharmacological stimulation and blockade of ER-α, respectively, led to a dose-dependent increase and decrease in basal PPI. In contrast, acute treatment with preferential ER-β modulators spared PPI under basal conditions. Pretreatment with either ER-α or ER-β agonist was, however, effective in blocking amphetamine-induced PPI disruption. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that activation of either ER isoform is capable of modulating dopamine-dependent PPI levels. At the same time, our results suggest that endogenous ER-α signaling may be more relevant than ER-β in the regulation of sensorimotor gating under basal conditions. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Amphetamine; Dopamine; Estradiol; Estrogen; Prepulse inhibition; Schizophrenia; Sensorimotor gating",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928142988

Data were extracted using structured fields, text searching and natural language processing applications. Results: Of 456 pregnant women identified, 236 (51.7%) had schizophrenia and related disorders, 220 (48.3%) had affective psychosis or bipolar disorder. Women with schizophrenia and related disorders were younger, less likely to have a partner in pregnancy, more likely to be black, to smoke or misuse substances and had significantly more time in the two years before pregnancy in acute care (inpatient or intensive home treatment) compared with women with affective disorders. Both groups had high levels of domestic abuse in pregnancy (recorded in 18.9%), were from relatively deprived backgrounds and had impaired functioning measured by the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale. Women in the affective group were more likely to stop medication in the first trimester (39% versus 25%) whereas women with non-affective psychoses were more likely to switch medication. Conclusions: A significant proportion of women, particularly those with non-affective psychoses, have modifiable risk factors requiring tailored care to optimize pregnancy outcomes. Mental health professionals need to be mindful of the possibility of pregnancy in women of childbearing age and prescribe and address modifiable risk factors accordingly. © Taylor et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Bipolar disorder; Pregnancy; Schizophrenia","Howard, L.M., Kumar, R., Thornicroft, G., Psychosocial characteristics and needs of mothers with psychotic disorders (2001) Br J Psychiatry, 178, pp. 427-432; Howard, L.M., Kumar, C., Leese, M., Thornicroft, G., The general fertility rate in women with psychotic disorders (2002) Am J Psy, 159 (6), pp. 991-997; Vigod, S.N., Seeman, M.V., Ray, J.G., Anderson, G.M., Dennis, C.L., Grigoriadis, S., Temporal trends in general and age-specific fertility rates among women with schizophrenia (1996-2009): a population-based study in Ontario, Canada (2012) Schizophr Res, 139 (1-3), pp. 169-175; Cantwell, R., Clutton-Brock, T., Cooper, G., Dawson, A., Drife, J., Garrod, D., Saving Mothers' Lives: reviewing maternal deaths to make motherhood safer: 2006-2008, the eighth report of the confidential enquiries into maternal deaths in the United Kingdom (2011) BJOG, 118, pp. 1-205; Austin, M., Kildea, S., Sullivan, E., Maternal mortality and psychiatric morbidity in the perinatal period: challenges and opportunities for prevention in the Australian setting (2007) Med J Aus, 186 (7), p. 364; Howard, L.M., Fertility and pregnancy in women with psychotic disorders (2005) Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol, 119 (1), pp. 3-10; Petersen, I., Gilbert, R.E., Evans, S.J., Man, S.L., Nazareth, I., Pregnancy as a major determinant for discontinuation of antidepressants: an analysis of data from The Health Improvement Network (2011) J Clin Psychiatry, 72 (7), pp. 979-985; Prevalence and trends in the use of antipsychotic medications during pregnancy in the US, 2001-2007: a population-based study of 585,615 deliveries.

Our method, which is based upon signal entropy, shows that spatially separate brain regions (or networks) generate temporally independent entropy time-courses. These time-courses are modulated by cognitive tasks, with an increase in local neural processing characterised by localised and transient increases in entropy in the neural signal. We explore the relationship between entropy and the more established time-frequency decomposition methods, which elucidate the temporal evolution of neural oscillations. We observe a direct but complex relationship between entropy and oscillatory amplitude, which suggests that these metrics are complementary. Finally, we provide a demonstration of the clinical utility of our method, using it to shed light on aberrant neurophysiological processing in schizophrenia. We demonstrate significantly increased task induced entropy change in patients (compared to controls) in multiple brain regions, including a cingulo-insula network, bilateral insula cortices and a right fronto-parietal network. These findings demonstrate potential clinical utility for our method and support a recent hypothesis that schizophrenia can be characterised by abnormalities in the salience network (a well characterised distributed network comprising bilateral insula and cingulate cortices). © 2015 Brookes et al.",,"Donner, T.H., Siegel, M., A framework for local cortical oscillation patterns (2011) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 15, pp. 191-199. , PMID: 21481630; Mukamel, R., Gelbard, H., Arieli, A., Hasson, U., Fried, I., Coupling Between Neuronal Firing, Field Potentials, and fMRI in Human Auditory Cortex (2005) Science, 309, pp. 951-954. , PMID: 16081741; Zumer, J.M., Brookes, M.J., Stevenson, C.M., Francis, S.T., Morris, P.G., Relating BOLD fMRI and neural oscillations through convolution and optimal linear weighting (2010) NeuroImage, 49, pp. 1479-1489. , PMID: 19778617; Garrett, D.D., Samanez-Larkin, G.R., MacDonald, S.W.S., Lindenberger, U., McIntosh, A.R., Moment-to-moment brain signal variability: A next frontier in human brain mapping?

This attenuation of the startle reflex represents a form of pre-attentional sensory gating known as prepulse inhibition (PPI). Although PPI does not require learning, its expression is regulated by higher cognitive processes. PPI deficits have been detected in several psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia where they co-exist with cognitive deficits. A potential link between PPI expression and cognitive performance has therefore been suggested such that poor PPI may predict, or may be mechanistically linked to, overt cognitive impairments. A positive relationship between PPI and strategy formation, planning efficiency, and execution speed has been observed in healthy humans. However, parallel studies in healthy animals are rare. It thus remains unclear what cognitive domains may be associated with, or orthogonal to, sensory gating in the form of PPI in healthy animals. The present study evaluated a potential link between the magnitude of PPI and spatial memory performance by comparing two subgroups of animals differing substantially in baseline PPI expression (low-PPI vs high-PPI) within a homogenous cohort of 100 male adult C57BL/6 mice.

This review presents the summary of research on potential genetic basis of neuroplasticity-modulation mechanism underlying tDCS and its implications for treating various psychiatric disorders. Method: A systematic review highlighting the genes involved in neuroplasticity and their role in psychiatric disorders was carried out. The focus was on the established genetic findings of tDCS response relationship with BDNF and COMT gene polymorphisms. Result: Synthesis of these preliminary observations suggests the potential influence of neuroplastic genes on tDCS treatment response. These include several animal models, pharmacological studies, mentally ill and healthy human subject trials. Conclusion: Taking into account the rapidly unfolding understanding of tDCS and the role of synaptic plasticity disturbances in neuropsychiatric disorders, in-depth evaluation of the mechanism of action pertinent to neuroplasticity modulation with tDCS needs further systematic research. Genes such as NRG1, DISC1, as well as those linked with the glutamatergic receptor in the context of their direct role in the modulation of neuronal signalling related to neuroplasticity aberrations, are leading candidates for future research in this area. Such research studies might potentially unravel observations that might have potential translational implications in psychiatry. © Scandinavian College of Neuropsychopharmacology 2015","genes; neuroplasticity; schizophrenia; tDCS",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927927051

Material/Methods: We studied 25 adolescents who had at least 1 parent with BD (BD group) and 28 adolescents who had no parents with BD (control group). The adolescent participants were between the ages of 12 and 17 years. We used the Adolescent Relationship Scales Questionnaire (A-RSQ) for the adolescents in the BD vs. control groups, and we used the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-age Children – present and lifetime version (K-SADS-PL). We used the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I), Clinician Version for each parent of adolescents in the BD and control groups to rule out psychopathologies. Results: Attachment styles of participants were assessed according to A-RSQ, dismissing attachment style scores of adolescents in BD group were found significantly higher compared to the healthy control group (p<0.05). As a result of the assessments, 12 adolescents (48%) out of 25 in the BD group and 5 adolescents (18%) out of 28 in the control group were given DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis, which is a statistically significant result (p<0.05). However, when psychiatric diagnoses were assessed separately, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: We found that the adolescent children of parents with BD have increased risk of developing mental illnesses, and that these adolescents adopt dismissing attachment styles. © Med Sci Monit.","Adolescent; Bipolar disorder; Parents; Psychopathology","Ainsworth, M.S., The personal origins of attachment theory.

This review and meta-regression analysis studies the effect of aging on MMSE scores in schizophrenic patients. Methods:: We entered the search terms schizophrenia and MMSE in PubMed and PsychInfo. Bibliographies of pertinent articles were also examined. We included every study presenting the MMSE scores in schizophrenic patients along with a corresponding mean age. We conducted our analyses using simple linear regression weighted for the inverse of within-trial variance of the age variable, thus conferring more importance to studies with narrower age groups. Results:: We identified 56 articles (n = 5,588) published between 1990 and 2012. The MMSE scores of schizophrenic patients decline by approximately 1 point for every four years (y = 34.939−0.247x, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [−0.304, −0.189], R 2 = 0,545), which is five times the rate in the general population. Institutionalized patients account for a large proportion of this decline (y = 37.603–0.308x, 95% CI [−0.349, −0.267], R 2 = 0.622) whereas community-dwelling patients are relatively stable throughout aging (y = 27.591–0.026x, 95% CI [−0.074, 0.023], R 2 = 0.037). Conclusions:: Subgroup analyses show different trajectories between institutionalized and outpatients with schizophrenia. The deterioration observed in institutionalized patients may have to do with greater illness severity, heavier medication load, vascular risk factors, and lack of stimulation in institutional settings. Studies documenting the role of these variables would be useful. Cognitive screening tools that assess executive functions would be interesting to study in schizophrenics, as they may reveal more subtle age-related cognitive changes not measured by the MMSE.

The aim of this study was to investigate the discrepancies between the subjective experiences and observed behaviors in near-fatal suicide attempters with untreated schizophrenia. Methods: A semi-structured interview was carried out with seven near-fatal suicide attempters with untreated schizophrenia to examine the subjective experiences at the time of the suicide attempt. The families of the patients were also interviewed to determine their recognition of the patients' psychotic symptoms and the suicidal ideation. The interview data were analyzed qualitatively. Results: Six subjects were undergoing exacerbation of the psychotic symptoms at the time of exhibiting the suicide-related ideation. One subject had been in a prolonged depressive state before attempting suicide. Although all the patients experienced severe distress due to psychotic symptoms and depressive mood, they all exhibited only low level or no help-seeking behavior, and six of seven families had not recognized the change in the patient's mental condition. Conclusions: Appropriate information about schizophrenia should be provided to the general public so that any help-seeking by the patients with this disease is not overlooked. In addition, accessible early intervention services for psychosis should be established. © Yamaguchi et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Family; Help-seeking; Psychoeducation; Suicide; Untreated schizophrenia","Brown, S., Excess mortality of schizophrenia.

However, such a core phenotype has not yet been investigated adopting a trans-domain approach that combines the phenomenological and the neurophysiological levels of analysis. The aim of this study is to investigate the relation between SDs and subtle, schizophrenia-specific impairments of emotional resonance that are supposed to reflect abnormalities in the mirror neurons mechanism. Specifically, we tested whether electromyographic response to emotional stimuli (i.e. a proxy for subtle changes in facial mimicry and related motor resonance mechanisms) would predict the occurrence of anomalous subjective experiences (i.e. SDs). Sampling and Methods: Eighteen schizophrenia spectrum (SzSp) patients underwent a comprehensive psychopathological examination and were contextually tested with a multimodal paradigm, recording facial electromyographic activity of muscles in response to positive and negative emotional stimuli. Experiential anomalies were explored with the Bonn Scale for the Assessment of Basic Symptoms (BSABS) and then condensed into rational subscales mapping SzSp anomalous self-experiences. Results: SzSp patients showed an imbalance in emotional motor resonance with a selective bias toward negative stimuli, as well as a multisensory integration impairment. Multiple regression analysis showed that electromyographic facial reactions in response to negative stimuli presented in auditory modality specifically and strongly correlated with SD subscore. Conclusions: The study confirms the potential of SDs as target phenotype for neurobiological research and encourages research into disturbed motor/emotional resonance as possible body-level correlate of disturbed subjective experiences in SzSp. © 2015 S.

Zinc concentrations must however, be tightly regulated as deficiencies are associated with multiple pathological conditions while an excess can be toxic. Zinc plays an important role as a cofactor in protein folding and function, e.g. catalytic interactions, DNA recognition by zinc finger proteins and modulation ion channel activity. There are 24 mammalian proteins specific for zinc transport that are subdivided in two groups with opposing functions: ZnT proteins reduce cytosolic zinc concentration while ZIP proteins increase it. The mammalian brain contains a significant amount of zinc, with 5-15% concentrated in synaptic vesicles of glutamatergic neurons alone. Accumulated in these vesicles by the ZnT3 transporter, zinc is released into the synaptic cleft at concentrations from nanomolar at rest to high micromolar during active neurotransmission. Low concentrations of zinc modulate the activity of a multitude of voltage- or ligand-gated ion channels, indicating that this divalent cation must be taken into account in the analysis of the pathophysiology of CNS disorders including epilepsy, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. In the context of the latest findings, we review the role of zinc in the central nervous system and discuss the relevance of the most recent association between the zinc transporter, ZIP8 and schizophrenia. An enhanced understanding of zinc transporters in the context of ion channel modulation may offer new avenues in identifying novel therapeutic entities that target neurological disorders. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Individuals with mental problems suffer from widespread disapproval and rejection of mental illnesses. In most cases people with mental disorders are socially excluded, discriminated and social participation in society is impeded. There exist different forms of stigmatization. Public stigmatization (public stigma) describes the negative attitudes that exist in the general population whereas self-stigma describes the internalization and acceptance of these negative attitudes in people with mental illnesses. Both forms contribute to negative outcomes such that people avoid communicating openly about their illness and seeking help from mental health professionals. Therefore, education and actions are needed on a societal and professional level to combat the stigmatization of mental disorders. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Internalization; Prejudice; Schizophrenia; Self concept; Stereotyping",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927922401

Given the extremely long time (12–15 years) and expense (>$1 billion) associated with the development of novel drug targets, repurposing of drugs with known and validated targets may be the most expeditious path toward deriving clinical utility from these GWAS findings. In the present study, we examined all genes within loci implicated by the PGC–SCZ GWAS against databases of targets of both approved and registered pharmaceutical compounds. We identified 20 potential schizophrenia susceptibility genes that encode proteins that are the targets of approved drugs. Of these, we prioritized genes/targets that are of clear neuropsychiatric interest and that are also sole members of the linkage disequilibrium block surrounding a PGC–SCZ GWAS hit. In addition to DRD2, 5 genes meet these criteria: CACNA1C, CACNB2, CACNA1I, GRIN2A and HCN1. An additional 20 genes coding for proteins that are the targets of drugs in registered clinical trials, but without approved indications, were also identified. Although considerable work is still required to fully explicate the biological implications of the PGC–SCZ GWAS results, pathways related to these known, druggable targets may represent a promising starting point.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 14 April 2015; doi:10.1038/mp.2015.28. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927923423

There are no current evidence based treatments for low mood within this group. The specific targeting of co-morbid conditions within complex mental health problems lends itself to the development of short-term structured interventions which are relatively easy to disseminate within health services. A brief cognitive intervention based on a competitive memory theory of depression, is being evaluated in terms of its effectiveness in reducing depression within this group. Methods/Design: This is a single blind, intention-to-treat, multi-site, randomized controlled trial comparing Positive Memory Training plus Treatment as Usual with Treatment as Usual alone. Participants will be recruited from two NHS Trusts in Southern England. In order to be eligible, participants must have a DSM-V diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder and exhibit at least a mild level of depression. Following baseline assessment eligible participants will be randomly allocated to either the Positive Memory Training plus Treatment as Usual group or the Treatment as Usual group. Outcome will be assessed at the end of treatment (3-months) and at 6-month and 9-month post randomization by assessors blind to group allocation. The primary outcome will be levels of depression and secondary outcomes will be severity of psychotic symptoms and cost-effectiveness. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with all participants who are allocated to the treatment group so as to explore the acceptability of the intervention. Discussion: Cognitive behaviour therapy is recommended for individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, the number of sessions and length of training required to deliver this intervention has caused a limit in availability. The current trial will evaluate a short-term structured protocol which targets a co-morbid condition often considered of primary importance by service users. If successful the intervention will be an important addition to current initiatives aimed at increasing access to psychological therapies for people diagnosed with severe mental health problems. © Steel et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",,"Mangalore, R., Knapp, M., Cost of schizophrenia in England (2007) J Ment Health Policy Econ, 10, pp. 23-41; (2009) Schizophrenia; Full National Clinical Guideline on Core Interventions in Primary and Secondary Care, , London: Gaskell Press; Updated guideline; Buckley, P., Miller, B., Lehrer, D., Castle, D., Psychiatric co-morbidities and schizophrenia (2009) Schizophr Bull, 35, pp. 383-402; Palmer, B.A., Pankrantz, S., Bostwick, M.D., The lifetime risk of suicide in schizophrenia: a re-examination (2005) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 62, pp. 247-253; Whitehead, C., Moss, S., Cardno, A., Lewis, G., Furtado, V.A., Antidepressants for people with both schizophrenia and depression (2002) Cochrane Database Syst Rev, (2); Butler, A.C., Chapman, J., Forman, E., Beck, A.T., The empirical status of cognitive-behavioral therapy: A review of meta-analyses (2006) Clin Psychol Rev, 26, pp. 17-31; Jacobson, N.S., Martell, C.R., Dimidjian, S., Behavioral activation treatment for depression: returning to contextual roots (2001) Clin Psychol Sci Pract, 8, pp. 255-270; Kuyken, W., Byford, S., Taylor, R.S., Watkins, E., Holden, E., White, K., Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy to prevent relapse in recurrent depression (2008) J Consult Clin Psychol, 76, pp. 966-978; Wykes, T., Steel, C., Everitt, B., Tarrier, N., Cognitive behavior therapy for schizophrenia: effect sizes, clinical models, and methodological rigor (2008) Schizophr Bull, 34, pp. 523-537; Brewin, C.R., Understanding cognitive behaviour therapy: a retrieval competition account (2006) Behav Res Ther, 44, pp. 765-784; Korrelboom, K., Jong, M., Huijbrechts, I., Daansen, P., Competitive Memory Training (COMET) for treating low self-esteem in patients with eating disorders: a randomized clinical trial (2009) J Consult Clin Psychol, 77, pp. 974-980; Korrelboom, K., Marissen, M., Assendelft, T., Competitive Memory Training for low self-esteem in patients with personality disorders: a randomized effectiveness study (2011) Behav Cogn Psychother, 39, pp. 1-11; Korrelboom, K., Weele, K., Gjaltema, M., Hoogstraten, C., Competitive memory training (COMET) for treating low self-esteem: a pilot study in a routine clinical setting (2009) Behav Therapist, 32, pp. 3-8; Korrelboom, K., Maarsingh, M., Huijbrechts, I., Competitive Memory Training (COMET) for treating low self esteem in patients with depressive disorders; a randomized clinical trial (2012) Depress Anxiety, 29, pp. 102-110; Gaag, M., Oosterhout, B., Daalman, K., Sommer, I.E., Korrelboom, K., Initial evaluation of the effects of competitive memory training (COMET) on depression in schizophrenia-spectrum patients with persistent auditory verbal hallucinations: a randomized controlled trial (2012) Br J Clin Psychol, 51 (2), pp. 158-171; Haddock, G., McCarron, J., Tarrier, N., Faragher, E., Tarrier, N., Scales to measure dimensions of hallucinations and delusions: the psychotic symptom rating scales (PSYRATS) (1999) Psychol Med, 29 (4), pp. 879-889; Beck, A.T., Steer, R.A., Brown, G.K., (1996) Manual for the beck depression inventory, , 2nd ed.

Phencyclidine (PCP) suppression of PPI in animals has been studied to elucidate the pathological elements of schizophrenia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PCP treatment or PPI in the brain are still poorly understood. In this study, quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis was performed on the prefrontal cortex from rats that were subjected to PPI after being systemically injected with PCP or saline. PCP downregulated phosphorylation events were significantly enriched in proteins associated with long-term potentiation (LTP). Importantly, this data set identifies functionally novel phosphorylation sites on known LTP-associated signaling molecules. In addition, mutagenesis of a significantly altered phosphorylation site on xCT (SLC7A11), the light chain of system xc-, the cystine/glutamate antiporter, suggests that PCP also regulates the activity of this protein. Finally, new insights were also derived on PPI signaling independent of PCP treatment. This is the first quantitative phosphorylation proteomic analysis providing new molecular insights into sensorimotor gating.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 14 April 2015; doi:10.1038/mp.2015.41. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927927704

Here we show, using genetically engineered mice, that the Cdc42 GTPase-activating multiadaptor protein, NOMA-GAP, regulates autism-like social behavior in the mouse, as well as dendritic spine and synapse development. Surprisingly, we were unable to restore spine morphology or autism-associated social behavior in NOMA-GAP-deficient animals by Cre-mediated deletion of Cdc42 alone. Spine morphology can be restored in vivo by re-expression of wild-type NOMA-GAP or a mutant of NOMA-GAP that lacks the RhoGAP domain, suggesting that other signaling functions are involved. Indeed, we show that NOMA-GAP directly interacts with several MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) proteins, and that this modulates NOMA-GAP activity toward Cdc42. Moreover, we demonstrate that NOMA-GAP is a major regulator of PSD-95 in the neocortex. Loss of NOMA-GAP leads to strong upregulation of serine 295 phosphorylation of PSD-95 and moreover to its subcellular mislocalization. This is associated with marked loss of surface α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor and defective synaptic transmission, thereby providing a molecular basis for autism-like social behavior in the absence of NOMA-GAP.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 14 April 2015; doi:10.1038/mp.2015.42. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927943937

They travel along multiple tangential paths to populate the cortical wall. As they reach this structure they undergo intracortical dispersion to settle in their final destination. At the cellular level, migrating interneurons are highly polarized cells that extend and retract processes using dynamic remodeling of microtubule and actin cytoskeleton. Different levels of molecular regulation contribute to interneuron migration. These include: (1) Extrinsic guidance cues distributed along migratory streams that are sensed and integrated by migrating interneurons; (2) Intrinsic genetic programs driven by specific transcription factors that grant specification and set the timing of migration for different subtypes of interneurons; (3) Adhesion molecules and cytoskeletal elements/regulators that transduce molecular signalings into coherent movement. These levels of molecular regulation must be properly integrated by interneurons to allow their migration in the cortex. The aim of this review is to summarize our current knowledge of the interplay between microenvironmental signals and cell autonomous programs that drive cortical interneuron porduction, tangential migration, and intergration in the developing cerebral cortex. © 2015 Peyre, Silva and Nguyen.","Branching; Cortex; Interneurons; Migration; Nucleokinesis; Progenitors","Aizawa, H., Wakatsuki, S., Ishii, A., Moriyama, K., Sasaki, Y., Ohashi, K., Phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM-kinase is necessary for semaphorin 3A-induced growth cone collapse (2001) Nat.

In the present study, we explored the neural mechanism of IOR in SCZ by comparing the target-locked N1 and P1 activity evoked by valid-cued trials with that evoked by invalid-cued trials. Twenty-seven schizophrenia patients and nineteen healthy controls participated in a task involving covert orienting of attention with two stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs: 700 ms and 1200 ms) during which 64-channel EEG data were recorded. Behavioral reaction times (RTs) were longer in response to valid-cued trials than to invalid-cued ones, suggesting an intact IOR in SCZ. However, reduced N1 amplitude elicited by valid-cued trials suggested a stronger inhibition of attention from being oriented to a previously cued location, and therefore a relative inhibition of perceptual processing at that location in SCZ. These results indicate that altered N1 activity is associated with the preservation of IOR in SCZ and could be a sensitive marker to track the IOR effect. © 2015 Tang et al.",,"Mesholam-Gately, R.I., Giuliano, A.J., Goff, K.P., Faraone, S.V., Seidman, L.J., Neurocognition in first-episode schizophrenia: A meta-analytic review (2009) Neuropsychol, 23 (3), pp. 315-316;

However, modeling human brain networks still faces several challenges including constructing networks at multiple spatial scales and finding common corresponding networks across individuals. As a consequence, many previous methods were designed for a single resolution or scale of brain network, though the brain networks are multi-scale in nature. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel approach to constructing multi-scale common structural brain networks from DTI data via an improved multi-scale spectral clustering applied on our recently developed and validated DICCCOLs (Dense Individualized and Common Connectivity-based Cortical Landmarks). Since the DICCCOL landmarks possess intrinsic structural correspondences across individuals and populations, we employed the multi-scale spectral clustering algorithm to group the DICCCOL landmarks and their connections into sub-networks, meanwhile preserving the intrinsically-established correspondences across multiple scales. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can generate multi-scale consistent and common structural brain networks across subjects, and its reproducibility has been verified by multiple independent datasets. As an application, these multi-scale networks were used to guide the clustering of multi-scale fiber bundles and to compare the fiber integrity in schizophrenia and healthy controls. In general, our methods offer a novel and effective framework for brain network modeling and tract-based analysis of DTI data.

The dynamic interplay between life events and psychological context, however, is less studied. In this study, we investigated the impact of life events on the onset and recurrence of mood episodes in bipolar offspring, as well as the effects of temperament, coping and parenting style on this association. Method: Bipolar offspring (n = 108) were followed longitudinally from adolescence to adulthood. Mood disorders were assessed with: the Kiddie Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia – Present and Lifetime Version or the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders; life events with the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule; and psychological measures using the Utrecht Coping List, Temperament and Character Inventory and short-EMBU (memories of upbringing instrument). Anderson–Gill models (an extension of the Cox proportional hazard model) were utilized. Results: Life events were associated with an increased risk for first and, although less pronounced, subsequent mood episodes. There was a large confounding effect for the number of previous mood episodes; findings suggest a possible kindling effect. Passive coping style increased the risk of mood episode onset and recurrent episodes, but also altered the effect of life events on mood disorders. Harm avoidance temperament was associated with mood episode recurrence. Conclusions: Life events are especially a risk factor in the onset of mood disorders, though less so in recurrent episodes. Psychological features (passive coping and harm-avoidant temperament) contribute to the risk of an episode occurring, and also have a moderating effect on the association between life events and mood episodes. These findings create potential early intervention strategies for bipolar offspring.

We systematically discuss this output to facilitate its timely integration in the psychosis research field; and encourage reflection for future research. Irrespective of imaging modality, studies addressing the effect of SZ/BD GWAS risk genes (ANK3, CACNA1C, MHC, TCF4, NRGN, DGKH, PBRM1, NCAN and ZNF804A) were included.

The aim of the present study was to describe service needs, as perceived by people with mental health difficulties living in the community and their service providers. We analyzed the difference between two necessity ratings using paired data in order to determine implications related to needs assessment for mental health services. Methods: This cross-sectional study used two self-reported questionnaires, with one questionnaire administered to mental health service users living in the community and another questionnaire to staff members providing services to those users at community service facilities. The study was conducted in psychiatric social rehabilitation facilities for people with mental health difficulties in Japan. The paired client and staff responses rated needs for each kind of mental health and social service independently. The 19 services listed in the questionnaire included counseling and healthcare, housing, renting, daily living, and employment. Overall, 246 individuals with mental health difficulties were asked to participate in this study, and after excluding invalid responses, 188 client-staff response dyads (76.4% of recruited people, 83.6% of people who gave consent) were analyzed in this study. A Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used to compare the perceived needs, and weighted and unweighted Kappa statistics were calculated to assess rating agreement within client-staff dyads. Results: Over 75% of participants in our study, who were people with mental health difficulties living in the community, regarded each type of mental health service as ""somewhat necessary,"" or ""absolutely necessary"" to live in their community. Most clients and staff rated healthcare facilities with 24/7 crisis consultation services as necessary. Agreement between client and staff ratings of perceived needs for services was low (Kappa = .02 to .26). Services regarding housing, renting a place to live, and advocacy had the same tendency in that clients perceived a higher need when compared to staff perceptions (p < .01). Conclusions: It is essential for the service providers to identify the services that each user needs, engage in dialogue, and involve clients in service planning and development. © 2015 Miyamoto et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Community mental health services; Consumer participation; Dialogue; Health services needs and demand; Housing; Mental health difficulties; Needs assessment; Patient-centered care; Schizophrenia; Shared decision making","Evans, S., Greenhalgh, J., Connelly, J., Selecting a mental health needs assessment scale: guidance on the critical appraisal of standardized measures (2000) J Eval Clin Pract, 6 (4), pp. 379-393; Wang, P.S., Lane, M., Olfson, M., Pincus, H.A., Wells, K.B., Kessler, R.C., Twelve-month use of mental health services in the united states: results from the national comorbidity survey replication (2005) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 62 (6), pp. 629-640; Wang, P.S., Demler, O., Kessler, R.C., Adequacy of treatment for serious mental illness in the United States (2002) Am J Public Health, 92 (1), pp. 92-98; Demyttenaere, K., Bruffaerts, R., Posada-Villa, J., Gasquet, I., Kovess, V., Lepine, J., Prevalence, severity, and unmet need for treatment of mental disorders in the world health organization world mental health surveys (2004) JAMA, 291 (21), pp. 2581-2590; Torres-Gonzalez, F., Ibanez-Casas, I., Saldivia, S., Ballester, D., Grandon, P., Moreno-Kustner, B., Unmet needs in the management of schizophrenia (2014) Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat, 10, pp. 97-110; Bradshaw, J., A taxonomy of social need (1972) Problems and progress in medical care, 7, pp. 71-92. , London MG, editor.

The rather rare co-morbidity of cancer and schizophrenia is an old hypothesis which needs further research on microRNAs as molecules that might exert their oncosuppressive or oncogenic activity in the context of their role in psychiatric disorders. The expression pattern of a variety of different microRNAs was investigated in patients (N = 6) suffering from schizophrenia termed control, patients with a solid tumor (N = 10) and patients with both schizophrenia and tumor (N = 8). miRNA profiling was performed on whole blood samples using the miRCURY LNA microRNA Array technology (6th & 7th generation). A subset of 3 microRNAs showed a statistically significant differential expression between the control and the study groups. Specifically, significant down-regulation of the let-7p-5p, miR-98-5p and of miR-183-5p in the study groups (tumor alone and tumorand schizophrenia) was observed (p<0.05). The results of the present study showed that let-7, miR-98 and miR-183 may play an important oncosuppressive role through their regulatory impact in gene expression irrespective of the presence of schizophrenia, although a larger sample size is required to validate these results. Nevertheless, further studies are warranted in order to highlight a possible role of these and other micro-RNAs in the molecular pathways of schizophrenia. © 2015 Rizos et al.",,"Zucchi, F.C., Yao, Y., Ward, I.D., Ilnytskyy, Y., Olson, D.M., Benzies, K., Maternal stress induces epigenetic signatures of psychiatric and neurological diseases in the offspring (2013) PLoS One, 8, p. e56967. , PMID: 23451123;

The aim of this study had been to define clusters of QoL levels from a specific multidimensional questionnaire (SQoL18) for patients with schizophrenia by using a new method of interpretable clustering and to test its validity regarding socio-demographic, clinical, and QoL information. Methods: In this multicentre cross-sectional study, patients with schizophrenia have been classified using a hierarchical top-down method called clustering using unsupervised binary trees (CUBT). A three-group structure has been employed to define QoL levels as “high”, “moderate”, or “low”. Socio-demographic, clinical, and QoL data have been compared between the three clusters to ensure their clinical relevance. Results: A total of 514 patients have been analysed: 78 are classified as “low”, 265 as “moderate”, and 171 as “high”. The clustering shows satisfactory statistical properties, including reproducibility (using bootstrap analysis) and discriminancy (using factor analysis). The three clusters consistently differentiate patients. As expected, individuals in the “high” QoL level cluster report the lowest scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (p = 0.01) and the Calgary Depression Scale (p < 0.01), and the highest scores on the Global Assessment of Functioning (p < 0.03), the SF36 (p < 0.01), the EuroQol (p < 0.01), and the Quality of Life Inventory (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Given the ease with which this method can be applied, classification using CUBT may be useful for facilitating the interpretation of QoL scores in clinical practice. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland","Clustering; Quality of life; Schizophrenia; SF36; SQoL18; Unsupervised classification",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927539003

This study compared the psychiatric-related health care resource utilization and direct medical costs for patients with schizophrenia initiating atypical or typical antipsychotics in Tianjin, China. Methods: Data were obtained from the Tianjin Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance database (2008-2010). Adult patients with schizophrenia with ≥1 prescription for antipsychotics after ≥90-day washout and 12-month continuous enrollment after first prescription was included. Psychiatric-related resource utilization and direct medical costs of the atypical and typical cohorts were estimated during the 12-month follow-up period. Logistic regressions, ordinary least square (OLS), and generalized linear models (GLM) were employed to estimate differences of resource utilization and costs between the two cohorts. One-to-one propensity score matching was conducted as a sensitivity analysis. Results: 1131 patients initiating either atypical (N = 648) or typical antipsychotics (N = 483) were identified. Compared with the typical cohort, the atypical cohort had a lower likelihood of hospitalization (45.8% vs. 56.7%, P < 0.001; adjusted OR: 0.58, P < 0.001) over the follow-up period. Medication costs for the atypical cohort were higher than the typical cohort ($438 vs. $187, P < 0.001); however, their non-medication medical costs were significantly lower ($1223 vs. $1704, P < 0.001). The total direct medical costs were similar between the atypical and typical cohorts before ($1661 vs. $1892, P = 0.100) and after matching ($1711 vs. 1868, P = 0.341), consistent with the results from OLS and GLM models for matched cohorts. Conclusions: The atypical cohort had similar total direct medical costs compared to the typical cohort. Higher medication costs associated with atypical antipsychotics were offset by a reduction in non-medication medical costs, driven by fewer hospitalizations. © 2015 He et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Atypical antipsychotics; China; Direct medical costs; Resource utilization; Schizophrenia; Typical antipsychotics",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928811393

An influential theory of schizophrenic deficits in executive function suggests that patients have difficulty maintaining and utilising an internal contextual representation, whose function is to ensure that stimuli are processed in a task-appropriate manner. In basic research on episodic memory, retrieved-context theories propose that an internal contextual representation is critically involved in memory search, facilitating the retrieval of task-appropriate memories. This contextual machinery is thought to give rise to temporal organisation during free recall: the tendency for successive recall responses to correspond to items from nearby positions on the study list. If patients with schizophrenia have a generalised contextual deficit, then this leads to the prediction that these patients will exhibit reduced temporal organisation in free recall. Methods. Using a combination of classic and recently developed organisational measures, we characterised recall organisation in 75 patients with schizophrenia and 72 nondisordered control participants performing a multi-trial free-recall task. Results. Patients with schizophrenia showed diminished temporal organisation, as well as diminished subjective organisation of their recall sequences relative to control participants. The two groups showed similar amounts of semantic organisation during recall. Conclusions. The observation of reduced temporal organisation in the patient group is consistent with the proposal that the memory deficit in schizophrenia can be characterised as a deficit in contextual processing. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","episodic memory; free recall; organisation; retrieved-context model",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927555563

There is little known about the effects of these interventions delivered in a booklet format in resource-poor countries. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted from September, 2012 to July, 2013 with 121 dyads of PDwS and their primary caregivers. Participants aged 18 years or older with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and their primary caregivers, from four outpatient mental health clinics in Jordan, were randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of a booklet form of psycho-education, with follow-up phone calls, and treatment as usual [TAU] (intervention, n = 58), or TAU (control, n = 63). Participants were assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention (post-treatment1) and at three months follow-up. The primary outcome measure was change in knowledge of schizophrenia. Secondary outcomes for PDwS were psychiatric symptoms and relapse rate, with hospitalization or medication (number of episodes of increasing antipsychotic dosage), and for primary caregivers were burden of care and quality of life. Results: PDwS in the intervention group experienced greater improvement in knowledge scores (4.9 vs -0.5; p <0.001) at post-treatment and (6.5 vs -0.7; p <0.001) at three month-follow-up, greater reduction in symptom severity (-26.1 vs 2.5; p <0.001: -36.2 vs -4.9; p <0.001, at follow-up times respectively. Relapse rate with hospitalization was reduced significantly at both follow-up times in the intervention group (p <0.001), and relapse with medication increased in the intervention group at both follow-up times (p <0.001). Similarly there was a significant improvement in the primary caregivers knowledge score at post-treatment (6.3 vs -0.4; P < 0.001) and three month-follow-up (7.3 vs -0.7; p <0.001). Primary caregivers burden of care was significantly reduced in the intervention group (-6.4 vs 1.5; p <0.001; -9.4 vs 0.8; p <0.001), and their quality of life improved (9.2 vs -1.6; p = 0.01; 17.1 vs -5.3; p <0.001) at post-treatment and three month-follow-up.

Here, an electrochemical sensor is reported for detecting the antipsychotic drug clozapine which is one of the most effective but under-utilized drugs for managing schizophrenia. This sensor employs a composite film of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) embedded within a matrix of the aminopolysaccharide chitosan. Chitosan allows programmable assembly of the composite film at an electrode address while the CNTs confer electrocatalytic activities that displace interfering serum peaks from the voltage region where clozapine oxidation occurs. Using differential pulse voltammetry, high sensitivities (limit of detection 0.05 × 10-6m) are demonstrated for clozapine analysis in buffer. In serum, clozapine sensitivity is reduced by an order of magnitude but still sufficient for clinical analysis. Finally, the detection of clozapine from the serum of a schizophrenia patient is demonstrated without the need for serum pretreatment. In the long term, it is envisioned that the CNT-chitosan coated electrode could be integrated within a small array of other sensor types to enhance information-extraction to allow mental health disorders to be better managed and better understood. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To achieve efficient therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), we develop an automated online SPE-LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantification of olanzapine, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine in human plasma. After adding an internal standard of diphenhydramine and centrifugation, a 10 μL plasma sample was directly injected into the SPE cartridge. While the analytes were retained on the SPE cartridge, the endogenous materials were washed out by the loading solvent. Following the valve switching, the analytes were eluted from the SPE cartridge to the analytical column by gradient elution. The analytes were quantified using a triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer. Calibration curves were linear over the concentration range of 0.25-50.00 ng mL-1 for olanzapine, and 0.50-100.00 ng mL-1 for fluoxetine and norfluoxetine. The intra- and inter-day precisions were within 1.17% and 4.63%. And the accuracies were between 95.60% and 101.48%. The mean matrix effect was in the range of 90.35% to 99.89% and mean recovery was in the range of 90.35% to 96.99%. This method has been successfully applied to two Chinese schizophrenia patients. The online SPE-LC-MS/MS method allows sensitive and robust quantification of olanzapine, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine for routine TDM in clinic. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Kantrowitz, J.T., Citrome, L., (2008) Expert Opin.

To better understand the effects of long-term administration, we measured global metabolic changes in mouse brain following 3 mg/kg/day haloperidol for 28 days. These conditions lead to movement-related side effects in mice akin to those observed in patients after prolonged use. Brain tissue was collected following microwave tissue fixation to arrest metabolism and extracted metabolites were assessed using both liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (MS). Over 300 unique compounds were identified across MS platforms. Haloperidol was found to be present in all test samples and not in controls, indicating experimental validity. Twenty-one compounds differed significantly between test and control groups at the p < 0.05 level. Top compounds were robust to analytical method, also being identified via partial least squares discriminant analysis. Four compounds (sphinganine, N-acetylornithine, leucine and adenosine diphosphate) survived correction for multiple testing in a non-parametric analysis using false discovery rate threshold < 0.1. Pathway analysis of nominally significant compounds (p < 0.05) revealed significant findings for sphingolipid metabolism (p = 0.015) and protein biosynthesis (p = 0.024). Altered sphingolipid metabolism is suggestive of disruptions to myelin. This interpretation is supported by our observation of elevated N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate in the haloperidol-treated mice (p = 0.004), a marker previously associated with demyelination. This study further demonstrates the utility of murine neurochemical metabolomics as a method to advance understanding of CNS drug effects. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Antipsychotics; Extrapyramidal symptoms; Metabolomics; Myelin; Sphingolipids",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927549052

Although it has been frequently described in psychotic syndromes, including paranoid schizophrenia, over a third of the documented cases of Capgras delusion are observed in patients with organic brain lesions or neurodegenerative disease, including Parkinson's Disease. Variants of Capgras involving animals or inanimate objects have also been described. The etiology of Capgras in Parkinson's remains unclear, but may arise from a combination of factors, such as frontal lobe dysfunction and dopaminergic medication. Case presentation: We present the case of a 53-year old right-handed female with Parkinson's disease who developed Capgras delusion during treatment with dopamine agonists and Levodopa/Carbidopa. She became convinced that her pet dogs and the plants in her garden had been substituted by identically looking ones. Our patient was initially treated with Quetiapine, with no improvement, and subsequently treated with Clozapine, which lead to partial regression of her symptoms. Neuropsychological Evaluation showed Mild Cognitive Impairment in Executive Functions. Conclusions: Given the clinical history, onset and evolution of symptoms we believe our patient's delusion resulted from the overlap of dopaminergic medication and Mild Cognitive Impairment in executive functions. Zoocentric Capgras, the variant we describe, has been rarely described in scientific literature, and we believe it is of interest due to its unusual characteristics. © Islam et al.","Capgras; Dopaminergic psychosis; Parkinson's disease","Capgras, J., Reboul-Lachaux, J., Société clinique de médecine mentale.

The reward system is implicated in schizophrenia and may contribute to the high comorbidity between nicotine use and schizophrenia, but very little research has been done on the topic. The reward-enhancement effect of nicotine has been shown to be important in nicotine use, but there have been no studies on this effect in animal models of schizophrenia. Objectives: This study was designed to determine the effects of phencyclidine, used to model negative symptoms of schizophrenia, on self-administration of nicotine with or without a co-occurring sensory reinforcer [i.e., visual stimulus (VS)] in rats. Methods: Phencyclidine (2.0 mg/kg) was administered before each of seven nicotine self-administration sessions (0.01 mg/kg/inf) after which rats (n = 8–9 per group) were given 7 days of extinction without phencyclidine pretreatment. Reinstatement using phencyclidine (2.0 mg/kg), nicotine (0.2 mg/kg), and yohimbine (1.25 mg/kg, a pharmacological stressor) was tested after extinction to determine if previous exposure to phencyclidine would alter reinstatement of active lever pressing. Results: Phencyclidine initially decreased nicotine self-administration but only in the groups with a concurrent VS. This decrease in self-administration dissipated after 5 days. During reinstatement, rats that had previously received phencyclidine during self-administration with a VS were more sensitive to stress-induced reinstatement than any other group. Conclusions: These results show a transitory effect of phencyclidine on nicotine self-administration. Phencyclidine may induce a potential sensitivity to pharmacological stressors contributing to reinstatement of nicotine. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Nicotine; Phencyclidine; Reinstatement; Schizophrenia; Self-administration",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926676447

Hypothesis: This study hypothesis is that the prescription of olanzapine in capsules is associated with a higher adherence than pills because the pharmacist cannot substitute the prescription for the same active pharmaceutical ingredient with a different bioappearance. Material and methods: The study included 1017 antipsychotic-treated patients with a 6 month follow-up. Adherence to olanzapine in pills (liable to change by pharmacist) was compared to olanzapine in capsules (not liable to change). Results: A significant increase in general adherence was noted throughout the study (48.6% adherence at baseline and 64.8% in the 6 month visit). When only the subgroup of patients with olanzapine was analyzed, no differences in adherence were noted between the capsule and pill presentations at baseline.

Few studies have examined the outcome of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) in patients with psychiatric history. We aimed to compare excess weight loss (%EWL) in patients with and without psychiatric comorbidities who underwent LSG or LAGB. Methods: Patients undergoing LSG or LAGB were identified from our prospective database. A multidisciplinary team evaluated all patients preoperatively, including a psychological evaluation. Patients with the diagnosis of depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia were included in the psychiatric comorbidity group (PSY). Others were included in group NON-PSY. All patients were first screened to be psychologically stable to undergo surgery. Initial BMI and %EWL at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively were compared. Results: A total of 590 patients (81.4 % women), with a median BMI of 43.8 kg/m2 (range 30–99) who underwent LSG (n = 222) or LAGB (n = 368) from January 2006 to June 2013, were identified. Psychiatric comorbidities that were well controlled at the time of surgery were found in 188 patients (31.9 %). Diagnostic criteria for depression were met in 154 patients (26.1 %), 75 patients suffered from anxiety (12.7 %), 9 from bipolar disorder, and 4 from schizophrenia (0.7 %). Initial BMI was not different between the two groups. No significant difference in %EWL between the groups was found during follow-up (44.13 vs. 43.37 %EWL, respectively, at 1 year; p = 0.76). When LSG and LAGB patients were analyzed as subsets, again no difference in %EWL at 1 year was found for PSY vs. NON-PSY (LSG: 51.56 vs. 54.86 %EWL; LAGB: 38.48 vs. 38.45 %EWL, all p = ns). In multivariate analysis, the differences from unadjusted analysis persisted. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that a similar %EWL can be achieved in patients undergoing LSG or LAGB despite the presence of well-controlled psychiatric comorbidity. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Abdominal; Bariatric; Clinical papers; G-I; Gut; Obesity; Research; Trials",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926655857

Here, we retrieved 17 104 DNMs from 3555 trios across four neuropsychiatric disorders: autism spectrum disorder, epileptic encephalopathy, intellectual disability and schizophrenia, in addition to unaffected siblings (control), from 36 studies by WES/WGS. After eliminating non-exonic variants, we focused on 3334 exonic DNMs for evaluation of their association with these diseases. Our results revealed a higher prevalence of DNMs in the probands of all four disorders compared with the one in the controls (P&lt;1.3 × 10-7). The elevated DNM frequency is dominated by loss-of-function/deleterious single-nucleotide variants and frameshift indels (that is, extreme mutations, P&lt;4.5 × 10-5). With extensive annotation of these ‘extreme’ mutations, we prioritized 764 candidate genes in these four disorders. A combined analysis of Gene Ontology, microRNA targets and transcription factor targets revealed shared biological process and non-coding regulatory elements of candidate genes in the pathology of neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, weighted gene co-expression network analysis of human laminar-specific neocortical expression data showed that candidate genes are convergent on eight shared modules with specific layer enrichment and biological process features. Furthermore, we identified that 53 candidate genes are associated with more than one disorder (P&lt;0.000001), suggesting a possibly shared genetic etiology underlying these disorders. Particularly, DNMs of the SCN2A gene are frequently occurred across all four disorders. Finally, we constructed a freely available NPdenovo database, which provides a comprehensive catalog of the DNMs identified in neuropsychiatric disorders.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 7 April 2015; doi:10.1038/mp.2015.40. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927534358

ITI-007 is an investigational new drug in development for treatment of schizophrenia, mood disorders, and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine brain occupancy of ITI-007 at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, dopamine D2 receptors, and serotonin transporters using positron emission tomography (PET) in 16 healthy volunteers. Methods: Carbon-11-MDL100907, carbon-11-raclopride, and carbon-11-3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile) (carbon-11-DASB) were used as the radiotracers for imaging 5-HT2A receptors, D2 receptors, and serotonin transporters, respectively. Brain regions of interest were outlined using magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) with cerebellum as the reference region. Binding potentials were estimated by fitting a simplified reference tissue model to the measured tissue-time activity curves. Target occupancy was expressed as percent change in the binding potentials before and after ITI-007 administration. Results: Oral ITI-007 (10–40 mg) was safe and well tolerated. ITI-007 rapidly entered the brain with long-lasting and dose-related occupancy. ITI-007 (10 mg) demonstrated high occupancy (&gt;80 %) of cortical 5-HT2A receptors and low occupancy of striatal D2 receptors (~12 %). D2 receptor occupancy increased with dose and significantly correlated with plasma concentrations (r2 = 0.68, p = 0.002). ITI-007 (40 mg) resulted in peak occupancy up to 39 % of striatal D2 receptors and 33 % of striatal serotonin transporters. Conclusions: The results provide evidence for a central mechanism of action via dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways for ITI-007 in living human brain and valuable information to aid dose selection for future clinical trials. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Antidepressant; Antipsychotic; Brain imaging; Dopamine receptor; Human; Neuroimaging; PET; Serotonin receptor",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926367290

As part of the 686 Program, teams "" unlocked"" and provided continuous mental health care to people with severe mental disorders who were found in restraints and largely untreated in their family homes. We implemented a nation-wide two-stage follow-up study to measure the effectiveness and sustainability of the ""unlocking and treatment"" intervention and its impact on the well-being of patients' families. Methods 266 patients unlocked from 2005 in ""686"" demonstration sites across China were recruited in Stage One of the study in 2009. In 2012, 230 of the 266 cases were re-interviewed (the Stage Two study). Outcome measures included the patient medication adherence and social functioning, family burden ratings, and relocking rate. We utilized pre-post tests to analyze the changes over time following the unlocking efforts. Results 96% of patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia. Prior to unlocking, their total time locked ranged from two weeks to 28 years, with 32% having been locked multiple times. The number of persons regularly taking medicines increased from one person at the time of unlocking to 74% in 2009 and 76% in 2012. Pre-post tests showed sustained improvement in patient social functioning and significant reductions in family burden. Over 92% of patients remained free of restraints in 2012. Practice-based evidence from our study suggests an important model for protecting the human rights of people with mental disorders and keeping them free of restraints can be achieved by providing accessible, community based mental health services with continuity of care.

Methods: Five electronic databases were searched until May 2014, including the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the Chinese Scientist Journal Database, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing WDD against placebo, antipsychotic drugs, or WDD combined with antipsychotic drugs against antipsychotic drugs alone were included. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane standards. Results: Thirteen RCTs (involving 1,174 patients) were included and the methodological quality was evaluated as generally low. The pooled results showed that WDD combined with antipsychotic drugs were more effective in clinical comprehensive effect, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores compared with antipsychotic drugs alone. However, WDD had less effectiveness compared with antipsychotics in clinical comprehensive effect; and WDD was not different from antipsychotic drugs for PANSS scores. The side effects were significantly reduced in the intervention group compared with the control group. Conclusions: WDD appears to be effective on improving symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. However, due to poor methodological quality in the majority of the included trials, the potential benefit from WDD needs to be confirmed in rigorous trials and the design and reporting of trials should follow the international standards. © 2015 Chinese Association of the Integration of Traditional and Western Medicine and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","randomized controlled trial; schizophrenia; systematic review; Wendan Decoction",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926684284

In this paper we suggest that neglect of these important psychoanalytic contributions to the understanding of alterations of self-experience in schizophrenia is at least partially due to an absence of sufficient operational definitions by which to study these constructs. We then detail an emergent line of research from the neurosciences investigating processes, referred to as metacognition, by which persons develop, evolve, and reflect upon mental representations of self and others. The findings from this growing line of research are convergent with psychoanalytic descriptions of self-experience in schizophrenia, and may provide a method to guide investigation of concepts found in psychoanalytic literature. This convergence presents a number of implications for both contemporary understandings of schizophrenia, future research, as well as psychoanalytically and nonpsychoanalytically informed treatments of schizophrenia.

The study of aggregated proteins can contribute to our understanding of the chronic and progressive condition of such diseases. Dysbindin, encoded by the schizophrenia susceptibility gene DTNBP1, has been reported to co-aggregate with DISC1. However, there has been no evidence to date on the aggregation tendency of dysbindin. Therefore, we investigated the isoform-specific aggregation of dysbindin. We found that dysbindin-1B aggregated into cell-invasive deposits in mice. Because of the efficient propagation of dysbindin-1B, we further studied the mechanism of propagation and identified it as exosome-mediated transmission of the aggregates. In addition, aggregates of dysbindin-1B were toxic. Through exosome-mediated propagation, the deposits of dysbindin-1B exerted toxic effects on recipient neurons a long distance away from the initial aggregation site in mice brain. The rapid long distance propagation of neurotoxic deposits of dysbindin-1B in affected neuronal circuitry indicates a possible mechanism for the progressive deterioration of neurons and cognitive function in CMD. © 2015 IBRO.","Aggregation; Chronic mental diseases; Dysbindin; Neurotoxicity; Propagation","Aguzzi, A., Rajendran, L., The transcellular spread of cytosolic amyloids, prions, and prionoids (2009) Neuron, 64, pp. 783-790; Atkin, T., Kittler, J., DISC1 and the aggresome: a disruption to cellular function?

Chronic stress exposure induces in rats escape deficit, disrupts the dopaminergic response to palatable food and the competence to acquire sucrose self-administration (SA), thus configuring a possible model of motivational anhedonia. Repeated lithium administration reverts stress effects and brings back to control values the breaking point (BP) score, a measure of reward motivation. In this study, we tested on this model two antidepressants, imipramine and fluoxetine, and two antipsychotics, haloperidol and clozapine. The dopaminergic response to sucrose consumption was studied in non food-deprived rats in terms of dopamine D1 receptor signaling in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcS). More specifically, we studied the modifications in dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of Mr 32,000 (DARPP-32) phosphorylation pattern following sucrose consumption. Fluoxetine reverted the escape deficit and showed no effects on dopaminergic response and sucrose SA. Imipramine reverted sucrose SA and dopamine response deficit in half of the rats and the escape deficit in all animals. Haloperidol did not affect stress-induced deficits. Clozapine-treated rats recovered the dopaminergic response to sucrose consumption and the competence to acquire sucrose SA, although they still showed the escape deficit, thus confirming that motivation toward reward may be dissociated from that to punishment escape. These results indicate that imipramine or fluoxetine are not endowed with a rapid onset antianhedonic effect.

Thyroid hormones and prolactin play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The present study aimed to analyze thyroid hormones and prolactin levels in patients with schizophrenia, and to explore its association with disease severity and suicide risk. Methods: Thirty-eight cases and 38 controls were included in the study. Serum thyroid hormones and prolactin were estimated in all the subjects. Disease severity was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and suicidal ideations were assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Results: Serum prolactin (p. =. 0.004) and free T4 (p. =. 0.029) were significantly elevated in the schizophrenia group as compared to controls. Serum prolactin was significantly associated with higher negative symptom scores (r. =. 0.418, p. =. 0.008), but not positive symptoms or general psychopathology of schizophrenia. Thyroid hormones were not associated with disease severity scores. Suicidal ideas were more common in schizophrenia patients with higher free T4 (p. =. 0.011). Conclusion: Prolactin and free T4 were increased in patients with schizophrenia as compared to controls. Suicidal ideation was associated with increased free T4, but not prolactin levels. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Prolactin; Psychopathology; Schizophrenia; Suicide; Thyroxin; Triiodothyronine","MacDonald, A.W., Schulz, S.C., What we know: findings that every theory of schizophrenia should explain (2009) Schizophr Bull, 35, pp. 493-508; Hayes, E., Gavrilidis, E., Kulkarni, J., The role of oestrogen and other hormones in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia (2012) Schizophr Res Treat, 2012, p. 540273; Bernal, J., Thyroid hormones and brain development (2005) Vitam Horm, 71, pp. 95-122; Feldman, A.Z., Shrestha, R.T., Hennessey, J.V., Neuropsychiatric manifestations of thyroid disease (2013) Endocrinol Metab Clin North Am, 42, pp. 453-476; Akiibinu, M.O., Ogundahunsi, O.A., Ogunyemi, E.O., Inter-relationship of plasma markers of oxidative stress and thyroid hormones in schizophrenics (2012) BMC Res Notes, 5, p. 169; Halbreich, U., Kinon, B.J., Gilmore, J.A., Kahn, L.S., Elevated prolactin levels in patients with schizophrenia: mechanisms and related adverse effects (2003) Psychoneuroendocrinology, 28, pp. 53-67; Zhang, X.Y., Zhou, D.F., Cao, L.Y., Zhang, P.Y., Wu, G.Y., Shen, Y.C., Prolactin levels in male schizophrenic patients treated with risperidone and haloperidol: a double-blind and randomized study (2005) Psychopharmacology (Berl), 178, pp. 35-40; Zhang, X.Y., Zhou, D.F., Yuan, C.L., Zhang, P.Y., Wu, G.Y., Shen, Y.C., Risperidone-induced increase in serum prolactin is correlated with positive symptom improvement in chronic schizophrenia (2002) Psychiatry Res, 109, pp. 297-302; Rajkumar, R.P., Prolactin and psychopathology in schizophrenia: a literature review and reappraisal (2014) Schizophr Res Treat, 2014, p. 175360; Brugnoli, R., Novick, D., Haro, J.M., Rossi, A., Bortolomasi, M., Frediani, S., Risk factors for suicide behaviors in the observational schizophrenia outpatient health outcomes (SOHO) study (2012) BMC Psychiatry, 12, p. 83; Pompili, M., Gibiino, S., Innamorati, M., Serafini, G., Del Casale, A., De Risio, L., Prolactin and thyroid hormone levels are associated with suicide attempts in psychiatric patients (2012) Psychiatry Res, 200, pp. 389-394; Kay, S.R., Fiszbein, A., Opler, L.A., The positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia (1987) Schizophr Bull, 13, pp. 261-276; Posner, K., Brown, G.K., Stanley, B., Brent, D.A., Yershova, K.V., Oquendo, M.A., The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale: initial validity and internal consistency findings from three multisite studies with adolescents and adults (2011) Am J Psychiatry, 168, pp. 1266-1277; Baumgartner, A., Pietzcker, A., Gaebel, W., The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis in patients with schizophrenia (2000) Schizophr Res, 44, pp. 233-243; Sim, K., Chong, S.A., Chan, Y.H., Lum, W.M., Thyroid dysfunction in chronic schizophrenia within a state psychiatric hospital (2002) Ann Acad Med Singapore, 31, pp. 641-644; Yazici, K., Yazici, A.E., Taneli, B., Different neuroendocrine profiles of remitted and nonremitted schizophrenic patients (2002) Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry, 26, pp. 579-584; Santos, N.C., Costa, P., Ruano, D., Macedo, A., Soares, M.J., Valente, J., Revisiting thyroid hormones in schizophrenia (2012) J Thyroid Res, 2012, p. 569147; Chatterjee, S.B., Dopamine related hormone levels in acute schizophrenia: (a study of 84 patients) (1988) Indian J Psychiatry, 30, pp. 7-11; Kuruvilla, K., Kuruvilla, A., Kanagasabapathy, A.S., Serum prolactin levels in schizophrenia: effects of neuroleptic medication - a preliminary study (1986) Indian J Psychiatry, 28, pp. 237-241; Shrivastava, A., Johnston, M., Bureau, Y., Shah, N., Baseline serum prolactin in drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia and outcome at five years: is it a predictive factor?

While longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have demonstrated progressive gray matter reduction of the hippocampus during the early phases of schizophrenia (SCZ), very little is known about whether functional connectivity (FC) between the hippocampus and other brain regions also exhibit progressive changes. In this study, resting state functional MRI (fMRI) was used to examine changes in hippocampal connectivity at baseline and follow-up scans comparing 68 patients with first episode SCZ and 62 matched controls. At baseline and follow-up, in the bilateral hippocampal network, SCZ mainly showed decreased FC with bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe, frontal gyrus temporal gyrus, precuneus, and cingulate cortex compared to controls. Furthermore, in the bilateral hippocampus, there was a significant interaction effect of group and time for FC with cerebellum posterior lobe, temporal gyrus, frontal gyrus, and posterior cingulate cortex. Interestingly, longitudinal changes of bilateral hippocampal connectivity with right middle frontal gyrus negatively correlated with positive symptom scores in SCZ. These results provide novel evidence for the progressive changes of FC between hippocampus and other brain regions in SCZ. It further suggests that longitudinal changes of bilateral hippocampal connectivity with right middle frontal gyrus can contribute to the formation and emergence of positive symptom of SCZ. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","First-episode schizophrenia;

As a consequence dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists have been widely investigated as putative pharmacological therapies for addiction. This general strategy, however, has had only limited success due in part to poor treatment adherence and efficacy and the significant adverse effects of dopaminergic medications. In this perspective, we discuss the potential therapeutic use of dopamine receptor partial agonists in addiction, developed initially as antipsychotic agents. Recent research indicates that the dopamine D<inf>2</inf> receptor partial agonists, such as aripiprazole, also shows useful ancillary efficacy in several animal models of psychostimulant and opioid addiction. Notably, these findings suggest that unlike full dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists these compounds have low abuse liability and are generally well tolerated. Indeed, partial dopamine agonists attenuate the rewarding properties of opioids without interfering with their analgesic effects. Herein we discuss the utility and potential of dopamine receptor partial agonists as treatments for both stimulant and non-stimulant drug addiction. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study is to relate electrophysiological changes with structural changes of Heschl's gyrus (HG) volume in schizophrenia. Fifteen schizophrenia patients were compared with control group by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetry and auditory evoked potentials. A significantly lower bilateral HG volumes and a significantly lower global field power value of the N1P2 component were detected in the schizophrenia group. The auditory evoked potentials have been used as a functional correlate that displayed a significant amplitude reduction that matched the reduction in the HG volume with the chronicity of the disease. This trend may be utilized as a vehicle to assess follow-up of the disorder by means of MRI and electrophysiology. © 2015.","Auditory evoked potentials; Global field power; Heschl's gyrus; Magnetic resonance volumetry","Hirayasu, Y., McCarley, R.W., Salisbury, D.F., Tanaka, S., Kwon, J.S., Frumin, M., Snyderman, D., Shenton, M.E., Planum temporale and Heschl gyrus volume reduction in schizophrenia: a magnetic resonance imaging study of first-episode patients (2000) Arch.

Glyceraldehyde-derived AGEs (Glycer-AGE) have strong neurotoxicity, and soluble receptors for AGEs (sRAGE) may ameliorate the effects of AGEs. In the present study, we measured Glycer-AGEs and sRAGE levels to determine their potential as diagnostic, therapeutic, or clinical biological markers in patients with schizophrenia. After enrollment of 61 admitted Japanese patients with acute schizophrenia and 39 healthy volunteers, 54 patients were followed up from the acute stage to remission. Serum biomarkers were measured in blood samples taken before breakfast using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and Glycer-AGEs were significantly higher and sRAGE levels were significantly lower in patients with acute schizophrenia than in healthy controls. Glycer-AGEs/sRAGE ratios were also higher in schizophrenia patients and were stable during the clinical course. Furthermore, discriminant analyses confirmed that Glycer-AGEs and Glycer-AGEs/sRAGE ratios are significant diagnostic markers for schizophrenia, and distinguished between patients and healthy controls in 70.0% of cases. However, these markers of carbonyl stress were not correlated with clinical features, including disease severity, or with daily chlorpromazine doses. These data indicate the potential of Glycer-AGEs, RAGEs, and their relative ratios as diagnostic markers for patients with schizophrenia. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Carbonyl stress; Clinical course; Glycer-AGEs; Schizophrenia; SRAGE","Arai, M., Yuzawa, H., Nohara, I., Ohnishi, T., Obata, N., Iwayama, Y., Haga, S., Itokawa, M., Enhanced carbonyl stress in a subpopulation of schizophrenia (2010) Arch.

With this technique, previous studies have observed that patients with schizophrenia are often associated with reduced brain activation in the prefrontal cortex during the verbal fluency task (VFT) of the English version or the Japanese version. However, it remains unclear whether there is a brain functional impairment in Chinese-speaking patients with schizophrenia. In this study, we designed a Chinese version of the VFT and performed a multichannel NIRS study in a large group of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We investigated brain activation during the task period of the Chinese version of the VFT within a schizophrenia group and a healthy group, respectively, and compared the relative changes between the two groups. Our results confirmed that Chinese-speaking patients with schizophrenia had significantly lower brain activation in the prefrontal cortex and superior temporal cortex when compared with healthy controls. Such findings based on the NIRS data provided us reliable evidences about brain functional deficits in the Chinese-speaking patients with schizophrenia. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Chinese version verbal fluency test;

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of the nitric oxide synthase, and the L-arginine:ADMA ratio are markers of endothelial dysfunction that predict mortality and adverse outcome in a range of cardiovascular disorders. Increased ADMA levels may also lead to increased oxidative stress. We hypothesized that ADMA and the L-arginine:ADMA ratio are increased in somatically healthy schizophrenia patients treated with atypical antipsychotics (AAP), and that the ADMA and the L-arginine: ADMA ratio are positively correlated to measures of oxidative stress. Methods: We included 40 schizophrenia patients treated with AAP, but without somatic disease or drug abuse, and 40 healthy controls. Plasma concentrations of ADMA and L-arginine were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Data were related to markers of systemic oxidative stress on DNA, RNA and lipids, as well as measures of medication load, duration of disease and current symptomatology. Results: Plasma ADMA and the L-arginine:ADMA ratio did not differ between schizophrenia patients and controls. Furthermore, ADMA and the L-arginine:ADMA ratio showed no correlations with oxidative stress markers, medication load, or Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores. Conclusions: Schizophrenia and treatment with AAP was not associated with increased levels of plasma ADMA or the L-arginine:ADMA ratio. Furthermore, plasma levels of ADMA were not associated with levels of systemic oxidative stress in vivo. © Jorgensen et al.","Asymmetric dimethylarginine; Atypical antipsychotics; Oxidative stress; Schizophrenia","Hennekens, C.H., Hennekens, A.R., Hollar, D., Casey, D.E., Schizophrenia and increased risks of cardiovascular disease (2005) Am Heart J, 150 (6), pp. 1115-1121; Hoang, U., Stewart, R., Goldacre, M.J., Mortality after hospital discharge for people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: retrospective study of linked English hospital episode statistics, 1999-2006 (2011) BMJ, 343, p. d5422; Laursen, T.M., Munk-Olsen, T., Nordentoft, M., Mortensen, P.B., Increased mortality among patients admitted with major psychiatric disorders: a register-based study comparing mortality in unipolar depressive disorder, bipolar affective disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia (2007) J Clin Psychiatry, 68 (6), pp. 899-907; Crump, C., Winkleby, M.A., Sundquist, K., Sundquist, J., Comorbidities and Mortality in Persons With Schizophrenia: A Swedish National Cohort Study (2013) Am J Psychiatry, 170 (3), pp. 324-333; Deanfield, J.E., Halcox, J.P., Rabelink, T.J., Endothelial function and dysfunction: testing and clinical relevance (2007) Circulation, 115 (10), pp. 1285-1295; Burghardt, K., Grove, T., Ellingrod, V., Endothelial nitric oxide synthetase genetic variants, metabolic syndrome and endothelial function in schizophrenia (2014) J Psychopharmacol, 28 (4), pp. 349-356; Forstermann, U., Sessa, W.C., Nitric oxide synthases: regulation and function (2012) Eur Heart J, 33 (7), pp. 829-837; Sydow, K., Munzel, T., ADMA and oxidative stress (2003) Atheroscler Suppl, 4 (4), pp. 41-51; Suda, O., Tsutsui, M., Morishita, T., Tasaki, H., Ueno, S., Nakata, S., Asymmetric dimethylarginine produces vascular lesions in endothelial nitric oxide synthase-deficient mice: involvement of renin-angiotensin system and oxidative stress (2004) Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, 24 (9), pp. 1682-1688; Korandji, C., Zeller, M., Guilland, J.C., Collin, B., Lauzier, B., Sicard, P., Time course of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and oxidative stress in fructose-hypertensive rats: a model related to metabolic syndrome (2011) Atherosclerosis, 214 (2), pp. 310-315; Boger, R.H., Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA): a novel risk marker in cardiovascular medicine and beyond (2006) Ann Med, 38 (2), pp. 126-136; Mohan, S., Fung, H.L., Mechanism of cellular oxidation stress induced by asymmetric dimethylarginine (2012) Int J Mol Sci, 13 (6), pp. 7521-7531; Pikula, A., Boger, R.H., Beiser, A.S., Maas, R., DeCarli, C., Schwedhelm, E., Association of plasma ADMA levels with MRI markers of vascular brain injury: Framingham offspring study (2009) Stroke, 40 (9), pp. 2959-2964; Anderssohn, M., Rosenberg, M., Schwedhelm, E., Zugck, C., Lutz, M., Luneburg, N., The L-Arginine-asymmetric dimethylarginine ratio is an independent predictor of mortality in dilated cardiomyopathy (2012) J Card Fail, 18 (12), pp. 904-911; Duckelmann, C., Mittermayer, F., Haider, D.G., Altenberger, J., Eichinger, J., Wolzt, M., Asymmetric dimethylarginine enhances cardiovascular risk prediction in patients with chronic heart failure (2007) Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, 27 (9), pp. 2037-2042; Loland, K.H., Bleie, O., Borgeraas, H., Strand, E., Ueland, P.M., Svardal, A., The association between progression of atherosclerosis and the methylated amino acids asymmetric dimethylarginine and trimethyllysine (2013) PLoS One, 8 (5), p. e64774; Seljeflot, I., Nilsson, B.B., Westheim, A.S., Bratseth, V., Arnesen, H., The L-arginine-asymmetric dimethylarginine ratio is strongly related to the severity of chronic heart failure.

This pragmatic study was conducted in a large, more representative sample of the general schizophrenia population compared to randomized controlled pivotal trials, to specifically mimic real-world clinical situations. After initiation on Day 1 and Day 8, patients received PP once monthly at flexible doses (50-150 mg eq.) intramuscularly. The primary efficacy outcome was defined as the percentage of patients achieving ≤ 30% improvement in PANSS total score from baseline (BL) to last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) endpoint (EP). Safety and tolerability assessments included Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) total score and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Overall, 212 patients received PP at least once after switching from oral antipsychotics, primarily due to lack of efficacy (45.8%). Significant improvements from BL in mean (SD) PANSS total score were observed from Day 8 onwards (BL to LOCF EP: -. 31.0 [29.0]; p. < 0.0001). At endpoint, two-thirds (66.7%) and 43.5% of patients achieved a ≤ 30% and ≤ 50% improvement in mean PANSS total score, respectively. PP was associated with significant improvements across secondary measures of symptom severity, subjective well-being, medication satisfaction, illness-related disorders of activity and participation, and patient functioning (p. < 0.0001; BL to LOCF EP). PP was generally well tolerated, with significant reductions in ESRS total score (p < 0.0001) and mainly mild-to-moderate TEAEs. TEAEs reported in ≤ 5% of patients were injection-site pain (13.7%), insomnia (10.8%), psychotic disorder (10.4%), headache and anxiety (both 6.1%). The PALMFlexS study findings provide valuable pragmatic clinical data on PP treatment in patients with acute schizophrenia previously unsuccessfully treated with oral antipsychotics. © 2014.","Acute;

This fMRI study was designed to investigate a neurobiological basis of social perception deficits of patients with schizophrenia in various social situations of daily life and their relationship with clinical symptoms and social dysfunction. Methods: Seventeen patients and 19 controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging, during which participants performed a virtual social perception task, containing an avatar's speech with positive, negative or neutral emotion in a virtual reality space. Participants were asked to determine whether or not the avatar's speech was appropriate to each situation. Results: The significant group × appropriateness interaction was seen in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), resulting from lower activity in patients in the inappropriate condition, and left DLPFC activity was negatively correlated with the severity of negative symptoms and positively correlated with the level of social functioning. The significant appropriateness × emotion interaction observed in the left superior temporal sulcus (STS) was present in controls, but absent in patients, resulting from the existence and absence of a difference between the inappropriate positive and negative conditions, respectively. Conclusions: These findings indicate that dysfunction of the DLPFC-STS network may underlie patients' abnormal social perception in various social situations of daily life. Abnormal functioning of this network may contribute to increases of negative symptoms and decreases of social functioning. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Daily life; Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; Schizophrenia; Social perception; Superior temporal sulcus","Ahmed, A.A., Vander Wyk, B.C., Neural processing of intentional biological motion in unaffected siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder: an fMRI study (2013) Brain Cogn, 83, pp. 297-306; Bara, B.G., Ciaramidaro, A., Walter, H., Adenzato, M., Intentional minds: a philosophical analysis of intention tested through fMRI experiments involving people with schizophrenia, people with autism, and healthy individuals (2011) Front Hum Neurosci, 5, p. 7; Berman, K.F., Illowsky, B.P., Weinberger, D.R., Physiological dysfunction of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia.

Among SGAs, clozapine and olanzapine had great liability to induce weight gain and metabolic adverse reactions. Leptin, adiponectin, and total ghrelin play important roles in energy homeostasis and are suggested to be biomarkers of metabolic disturbances. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the differential effects of antipsychotics (olanzapine and clozapine) on the levels of adipocytokines (leptin and adiponectin) and total ghrelin.Three hundred and thirty-three patients with schizophrenia under clozapine or olanzapine monotherapy were recruited. Control participants were recruited from a healthy community population based on a health investigation (N= 119). Fasting blood samples for glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin, adiponectin, and total ghrelin were analyzed.There were significant differences in the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose between these three groups. Post hoc comparisons showed that the olanzapine group had the highest levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The levels of leptin, adiponectin, and total ghrelin were also significantly different between the three groups after controlling age and body mass index (BMI). Post hoc comparisons showed that the olanzapine group had the lowest levels of adiponectin and total ghrelin.The present study found that the uses of olanzapine and clozapine were associated with changes in adipocytokines and total ghrelin, even after adjusting potential confounding factors. Olanzapine had greater influences on adiponectin and total ghrelin than clozapine. The changes in adipocytokines and total ghrelin were a direct effect of antipsychotics on hormonal pathways of energy homeostasis, rather than the result of weight gain. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Adiponectin; Clozapine; Ghrelin; Leptin; Olanzapine; Schizophrenia","Allison, D.B., Mentore, J.L., Heo, M., Chandler, L.P., Cappelleri, J.C., Infante, M.C., Antipsychotic-induced weight gain: a comprehensive research synthesis (1999) Am J Psychiatry, 156, pp. 1686-1696; Bai, Y.M., Chen, T.T., Yang, W.S., Chi, Y.C., Lin, C.C., Liou, Y.J., Association of adiponectin and metabolic syndrome among patients taking atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia: a cohort study (2009) Schizophr Res, 111, pp. 1-8; Brown, S., Kim, M., Mitchell, C., Inskip, H., Twenty-five year mortality of a community cohort with schizophrenia (2010) Br J Psychiatry, 196, pp. 116-121; Casey, D.E., Metabolic issues and cardiovascular disease in patients with psychiatric disorders (2005) Am J Med, 118, pp. 15S-22S; Chen, V.C., Wang, T.N., Lu, M.L., Chou, J.Y., Ju, P.C., Wu, J.Y., Weight gain and ghrelin level after olanzapine monotherapy (2011) Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry, 35, pp. 632-635; Deng, C., Weston-Green, K., Huang, X.F., The role of histaminergic H1 and H3 receptors in food intake: a mechanism for atypical antipsychotic-induced weight gain?

Additionally, the diagnostic experiments take hours, and the accuracy of the analysis is low or unreliable. This article presents the ""TFFO"" (Time-Frequency transformation followed by Feature-Optimization), a novel approach for schizophrenia detection showing great success in classification accuracy with no false positives.

Although a high prevalence of autistic-like traits/symptoms has been identified in the pediatric psychiatric population of normal intelligence, there are no reports from adult psychiatric population. This study examined whether there is a greater prevalence of autistic-like traits/symptoms in patients with adult-onset psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia, and whether such an association is independent of symptom severity. The subjects were 290 adults of normal intelligence between 25 and 59 years of age (MDD, n=125; bipolar disorder, n=56; schizophrenia, n=44; healthy controls, n=65). Autistic-like traits/symptoms were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale for Adults. Symptom severity was measured using the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and/or the Young Mania Rating Scale. Almost half of the clinical subjects, except those with remitted MDD, exhibited autistic-like traits/symptoms at levels typical for sub-threshold or threshold autism spectrum disorder. Furthermore, the proportion of psychiatric patients that demonstrated high autistic-like traits/symptoms was significantly greater than that of healthy controls, and not different between that of remitted or unremitted subjects with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. On the other hand, remitted subjects with MDD did not differ from healthy controls with regard to the prevalence or degree of high autistic-like traits/symptoms. A substantial proportion of adults with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia showed high autistic-like traits/symptoms independent of symptom severity, suggesting a shared pathophysiology among autism spectrum disorder and these psychiatric disorders. Conversely, autistic-like traits among subjects with MDD were associated with the depressive symptom severity. These findings suggest the importance of evaluating autistic-like traits/symptoms underlying adult-onset psychiatric disorders for the best-suited treatment. Further studies with a prospective design and larger samples are needed.

However, there is little agreement regarding its measurement. A common, often cited instrument for assessing self-reported social functioning is the Social Functioning Scale (SFS). The study aimed to investigate the reliability and validity of the German translation. 101 patients suffering from schizophrenia (SZ) and 101 matched controls (C) (60 male / 41 female, 35.8 years in both groups) completed the German version. In addition, demographic, clinical, and functional data were collected. Internal consistency was investigated calculating Cronbach 's alpha for SFS full scale (α: .81) and all subscales (α: .59-.88). Significant bivariate correlation coefficients were found between all subscales as well as between all subscales and full scale (p <.01). For the total sample, principal component analysis gave evidence to prefer a single-factor solution (eigenvalue - 1) accounting for 48.5%of the variance. For the subsamples, a two-component solution (SZ; 57.0%) and a three-component solution (C; 65.6%) fitted best, respectively. For SZ and C, significant associations were found between SFS and external criteria. The main factor ""group "" emerged as being significant. C showed higher values on both subscales and full scale. The sensitivity of the SFS was examined using discriminant analysis. 86.5%of the participants could be categorized correctly to their actual group. The German translation of the SFS turned out to be a reliable and valid questionnaire comparable to the original English version. This is in line with Spanish and Norwegian translations of the SFS. Concluding, the German version of the SFS is well suited to become a useful and practicable instrument for the assessment of social functioning in both clinical practice and research. It accomplishes commonly used external assessment scales. © 2015 Iffland et al. .",,"Bellack, A.S., Green, M.F., Cook, J.A., Fenton, W., Harvey, P.D., Heaton, R.K., Assessment of community functioning in people with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses: A white paper based on an NIMH-sponsored workshop (2007) Schizophr Bull., 33 (3), pp. 805-822. , PMID: 16931542; Brissos, S., Molodynski, A., Dias, V.V., Figueira, M.L., The importance of measuring psychosocial functioning in schizophrenia (2011) Ann Gen Psychiatry.BioMed Central Ltd, 10 (1), p. 18; Leifker, F.R., Patterson, T.L., Heaton, R.K., Harvey, P.D., Validating measures of real-world outcome: The results of the VALERO expert survey and RAND panel (2011) Schizophr Bull., 37 (2), pp. 334-343. , PMID: 19525354; Burns, T., Patrick, D., Social functioning as an outcome measure in schizophrenia studies (2007) Acta Psychiatr Scand., 116 (6), pp. 403-418. , PMID: 17941964; Figueira, M.L., Brissos, S., Measuring psychosocial outcomes in schizophrenia patients (2011) Curr Opin Psychiatry., 24 (2), pp. 91-99. , PMID: 21285701; Priebe, S., Social outcomes in schizophrenia (2007) Br J Psychiatry., 191 (50), pp. s15-s20; Juckel, G., Morosini, P.L., The new approach: Psychosocial functioning as a necessary outcome criterion for therapeutic success in schizophrenia (2008) Curr Opin Psychiatry., 21 (6), pp. 630-639. , PMID: 18852573; Hellvin, T., Sundet, K., Vaskinn, A., Simonsen, C., Ueland, T., Andreassen, O.A., Validation of the norwegian version of the social functioning scale (SFS) for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (2010) Scand J Psychol., 51 (6), pp. 525-533. , PMID: 20642739; Vaskinn, A., Sundet, K., Simonsen, C., Hellvin, T., Melle, I., Andreassen O a.

The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the rate and clinical characteristics of PDSS since olanzapine LAI entered commercial use. Methods: Cases of PDSS were identified from all reported adverse events during worldwide commercial use of olanzapine LAI through to 1 March 2014. Data sources included two ongoing post-marketing safety studies as well as spontaneously reported adverse events from routine clinical practice over a 5-year period (1 March 2009 to 1 March 2014). Results: A total of 338 PDSS events were identified. Of these, 91% occurred within 1 hour of injection, and 52% of these occurred within 15 minutes. None of the PDSS events in this analysis were fatal, and most resolved within 72 hours. The most common symptoms (occurring in >30% of cases) were sedation (61%), confusion (56%), dysarthria (54%), somnolence (46%), dizziness (45%) and disorientation (35%). Overall, PDSS occurred with approximately 0.07% of injections and in 0.46-1.03% of patients (reporting and incidence rates from spontaneous reports and post-marketing safety studies, respectively). Conclusions: The PDSS events reported during routine clinical use of olanzapine LAI are generally similar in incidence and presentation to those reported in clinical trials. Caution should be applied when interpreting spontaneously reported rates of adverse events, however, due to potential under-reporting. Implemented risk-minimisation activities may contribute substantially to the identification and appropriate management of patients with PDSS in clinical practice. © Bushe et al.","Depot antipsychotic; Olanzapine; Olanzapine long-acting injection; Olanzapine pamoate; Post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome; Schizophrenia","Tiihonen, J., Haukka, J., Taylor, M., Haddad, P.M., Patel, M.X., Korhonen, P., A nationwide cohort study of oral and depot antipsychotics after first hospitalization for schizophrenia (2011) Am J Psychiatry, 168, pp. 603-609; Velligan, D.I., Weiden, P.J., Sajatovic, M., Scott, J., Carpenter, D., Ross, R., The expert consensus guideline series: adherence problems in patients with serious and persistent mental illness (2009) J Clin Psychiatry, 70, pp. 1-46; Kane, J.M., Detke, H.C., Naber, D., Sethuraman, G., Lin, D.Y., Bergstrom, R.F., Olanzapine long-acting injection: a 24-week, randomized, double-blind trial of maintenance treatment in patients with schizophrenia (2010) Am J Psychiatry, 167, pp. 181-189; Lauriello, J., Lambert, T., Andersen, S., Lin, D., Taylor, C.C., McDonnell, D., An 8-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of olanzapine long-acting injection in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia (2008) J Clin Psychiatry, 69, pp. 790-799; McDonnell, D., Andersen, S., Detke, H., Zhao, F., Watson, S., Long-term safety and tolerability of open-label olanzapine long-acting injection in the treatment of schizophrenia: 190-week interim results (2011) Clin Med Insights: Psychiatry, 3, pp. 37-47; Detke, H.C., McDonnell, D.P., Brunner, E., Zhao, F., Sorsaburu, S., Stefaniak, V.J., Post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome in patients with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine long-acting injection.

Reelin mRNA and protein levels are reduced in various structures of post-mortem schizophrenic brains, in a similar way to those found in heterozygous reeler mice (HRM). Reelin is involved in protein expression in dendritic spines that are the major location where synaptic connections are established. Thus, we hypothesized that a genetic deficit in reelin would affect the expression and function of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors that are associated with the action of current antipsychotic drugs.In this study, D2 and 5-HT2A receptor expression and function were quantitated by using radioligand binding studies in the frontal cortex and striatum of HRM and wild-type mice (WTM). We observed increased expression (p&lt;0.05) in striatum membranes and decreased expression (p&lt;0.05) in frontal cortex membranes for both dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors from HRM compared to WTM.Our results show parallel alterations of D2 and 5-HT2A receptors that are compatible with a possible hetero-oligomeric nature of these receptors. These changes are similar to changes described in schizophrenic patients and provide further support for the suitability of using HRM as a model for studying this disease and the effects of antipsychotic drugs. © 2015 IBRO.","Frontal cortex; GPCRs; Heterozygous reeler mice; Reelin; Schizophrenia; Striatum","Abi-Dargham, A., Do we still believe in the dopamine hypothesis?

The mesocortical DA system has been implicated particularly in the cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenia. Agonism at 5-HT2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with increases in cortical DA release. Evidence indicates that 5-HT2A receptors in the cortex regulate mesocortical DA release through stimulation of a ""long-loop"" feedback system from the PFC to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and back. However, a causal role for VTA glutamate in the 5-HT2-induced increases in PFC DA has not been established. The present study does so by measuring 5-HT2 agonist-induced DA release in the cortex after infusions of glutamate antagonists into the VTA of the rat. Infusions of a combination of a N-methyl-. d-aspartic acid (NMDA) (AP-5: 2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid) and an AMPA/kainate (CNQX: 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) receptor antagonist into the VTA blocked the increases in cortical DA produced by administration of the 5-HT2 agonist DOI [(±)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine] (2.5. mg/kg s.c.). These results demonstrate that stimulation of glutamate receptors in the VTA is necessary for 5-HT2 agonist-induced increases in cortical DA. © 2015.","AMPA; Antipsychotic; Microdialysis; NMDA; Prefrontal cortex;

The aim of this study was to clarify the patterns of cognitive deficits in drug-naive patients with schizophrenia and non-psychotic major depressive disorder (MDD) as compared with controls. Methods Thirty drug-naïve participants with schizophrenia, 30 counterparts with non-psychotic MDD, and 30 age-, sex-, and education years-matched healthy controls were recruited. Neuropsychological tests, including the Wisconsin Card Test (WCST), the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and the Finger Tapping Test (FTT), were administered. Results Patients with schizophrenia performed more poorly than the patients with MDD and the normal controls in the WCST. The patients with schizophrenia and the patients with MDD both performed more poorly than the normal controls in the CPT. The patients with MDD also performed more poorly than the normal controls in the FTT. Limitations The age of onset of MDD in this study was younger than in previous reports. The cross-sectional design, small sample sizes, and limited numbers of neuropsychological domains in this study are all obstacles to making a clear causal conclusion. Conclusions These results revealed a distinct pattern of neurocognitive dysfunction among drug-naive patients with schizophrenia and MDD, which may imply different underlying neurobiological mechanisms in schizophrenia and MDD. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of antipsychotics on this clinical dimension is not specific and the common practice of prescribing benzodiazepines remains unsatisfactory.Areas covered: The authors review recent well-designed clinical trials for anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. The content includes information derived from trial databases, regulatory authorities and scientific literature.Expert opinion: Anxiety in schizophrenia has severe consequences and specific clinical features, which require a specific therapy, beyond benzodiazepines. In these past 2 years, two compounds (the anticonvulsant/anxiolytic pregabalin and the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine) were on Phase III/IV clinical trials for schizophrenia, with comorbid anxiety as a primary outcome measure. Potential for success is high, given their strong rationale and the clinical experience with both drugs. Anxiety (as a symptom) was a secondary outcome measure in trials for schizophrenia involving seven other compounds (lurasidone, amisulpride, bitopertin, oxytocin, famotidine, cannabidiol and the L-theanine and pregnenolone combination). Primary completion date is expected in the next 2 years. In spite of ancient positive results and a strong rationale, aripiprazole and related compounds were not in recent clinical trials. The authors believe that these compounds deserve more attention. © Informa UK, Ltd.","Anxiety; Clinical trials; Pregabalin; Quetiapine; Schizophrenia","Tandon, R., Gaebel, W., Barch, D.M., Definition and description of schizophrenia in the DSM-5 (2013) Schizophr Res, 150, pp. 3-10; Leucht, S., Burkard, T., Henderson, J., Physical illness and schizophrenia: A review of the literature (2007) Acta Psychiatr Scand, 116, pp. 317-333; Millier, A., Schmidt, U., Angermeyer, M.C., Humanistic burden in schizophrenia: A literature review (2014) J Psychiatr Res, 54, pp. 85-93; Vos, T., Flaxman, A.D., Naghavi, M., Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (2012) Lancet, 380, pp. 2163-2196; Llorca, P.-M., Lancon, C., Blanc, O., A composite scale applied to evaluate anxiety in schizophrenic patients (SAES) (2014) Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci, 264, pp. 171-178; Braga, R.J., Reynolds, G.P., Siris, S.G., Anxiety comorbidity in schizophrenia (2013) Psychiatry Res, 210, pp. 1-7; Pallanti, S., Cantisani, A., Grassi, G., Anxiety as a Core Aspect of Schizophrenia (2013) Curr Psychiatry Rep, 15, pp. 1-5; Achim, A.M., Maziade, M., Raymond, E., How prevalent are anxiety disorders in schizophrenia?

Prefrontal dysfunction is closely associated with the symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition to the features typical of schizophrenia, patients also present with aspects of cognitive disorders. Based on these relationships, a monkey model mimicking the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia has been made using treatment with the non-specific competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, phencyclidine. The symptoms are ameliorated by atypical antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine. The beneficial effects of clozapine on behavioral impairment might be a specific indicator of schizophrenia-related cognitive impairment. © 2015, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","monkey model; prefrontal cortex; schizophrenia","Insel, T., Rethinking schizophrenia (2010) Nature, 468, pp. 187-193. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3cXhsVWjsb%2FP, PID: 21068826; Akdeniz, C., Tost, H., Meyer-Lindenberg, A., The neurobiology of social environmental risk for schizophrenia: an evolving research field (2014) Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol, 49, pp. 507-517. , PID: 24638893; Schmitt, A., Malchow, B., Hasan, A., Falkai, P., The impact of environmental factors in severe psychiatric disorders (2014) Front Neurosci, 8, p. 19. , PID: 24574956; Bergen, S.E., O’Dushlaine, C.T., Lee, P.H., Fanous, A.H., Ruderfer, D.M., Ripke, S., Genetic modifiers and subtypes in schizophrenia: Investigations of age at onset, severity, sex and family history (2014) Schizophr Res, 154, pp. 48-53. , PID: 24581549; Fuster, J.M., Frontal lobes (1993) Curr Opin Neurobiol, 3, pp. 160-165. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK3s3ptFGguw%3D%3D, PID: 8513226; Fuster Joaquin, M., (2008) The prefrontal cortex, , Academic Press, Los Angeles, CA:; Goldman-Rakic, P.S., Topography of cognition: parallel distributed networks in primate association cortex (1988) Annu Rev Neurosci, 11, pp. 137-156. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaL1c3gvVaktQ%3D%3D, PID: 3284439; Neubert, F.X., Mars, R.B., Thomas, A.G., Sallet, J., Rushworth, M.F., Comparison of human ventral frontal cortex areas for cognitive control and language with areas in monkey frontal cortex (2014) Neuron, 81, pp. 700-713. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXhsVyqu7Y%3D, PID: 24485097; Weinberger, D.R., Berman, K.F., Zec, R.F., Physiologic dysfunction of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia.

Pharmacological blockade of NMDA receptors (NMDAR), or their genetic ablation in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic interneurons can induce schizophrenia-like behavior in animals. NMDAR-mediated currents shape the maturation of GABAergic interneurons during a critical period of development, making transient blockade of NMDARs during this period an attractive model for the developmental changes that occur in the course of schizophrenia's pathophysiology. Here, we examined whether developmental administration of the non-competitive NMDAR antagonist ketamine results in persistent deficits in PFC-dependent behaviors in adult animals. Mice received injections of ketamine (30. mg/kg) on postnatal days (PND) 7, 9 and 11, and then tested on a battery of behavioral experiments aimed to mimic major symptoms of schizophrenia in adulthood (between PND 90 and 120). Ketamine treatment reduced the number of cells that expressed PV in the PFC by ~60% as previously described. Ketamine affected performance in an attentional set-shifting task, impairing the ability of the animals to perform an extradimensional shift to acquire a new strategy. Ketamine-treated animals showed deficits in latent inhibition, novel-object recognition and social novelty detection compared to their SAL-treated littermates. These deficits were not a result of generalized anxiety, as both groups performed comparably on an elevated plus maze. Ketamine treatment did not cause changes in amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion that are often taken as measures for the positive-like symptoms of the disorder. Thus, ketamine administration during development appears to be a useful model for inducing cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. © 2015.","Ketamine; NMDAR; Parvalbumin; Perinatal; Prefrontal cortex;

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in neuronal development, differentiation and plasticity. A functional single nucleotide polymorphism that results in a valine (Val) to methionine (Met) substitution at codon 66 (Val66Met) results in the aberrant sorting and release of mature BDNF through the activity-dependent secretion pathway. The Val66Met polymorphism has been linked to impaired neurocognitive function in healthy adults, and identified as a locus of risk for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the relationship between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and schizophrenia, integrating evidence from the fields of genetic epidemiology, clinical psychiatry, behavioral neuroscience and neuroimaging. We argue that while the Val66Met polymorphism may not be a major risk-conferring agent for the development of schizophrenia per se, there is mounting evidence that the polymorphism modulates a range of clinical features of the illness, including age of onset, symptoms, therapeutic responsiveness, neurocognitive function and brain morphology. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Age of onset; Animal models of schizophrenia; BDNF; Brain morphology; Brain-derived neurotrophic factor; Clinical pleiotropy; Cognition; Comorbid symptoms; G196A; Psychosis; Rs6265; Schizophrenia; Therapeutic responsiveness; Val66Met; Val66Met mice","Aas, M., Haukvik, U.K., Djurovic, S., Bergmann, O., Athanasiu, L., Tesli, M.S., Hellvin, T., Melle, I., BDNF Val66Met modulates the association between childhood trauma, cognitive and brain abnormalities in psychoses (2013) Prog.

Recent studies applying new genomic technology to large samples have yielded substantial advances in identifying specific, associated DNA variants as well as clarifying the underlying genetic architecture of the disorder. The genetic liability of schizophrenia is now established as polygenic, with risk alleles in many genes existing across the full allelic frequency spectrum. It has also become apparent that schizophrenia shares risk alleles with other neuropsychiatric phenotypes, such as bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. These risk variants aggregate in several sets of functionally related genes, thereby providing novel insights into disease pathogenesis and opportunities for research into discovering new treatments. © 2014 The Authors.",,"Gottesman, I.I., (1991) Schizophrenia Genesis: The Origins of Madness, , Henry Holt & Company Inc New York;

This study investigated and compared P50 suppression (a neurophysiological measure of sensory gating) and perceptual abnormalities related to sensory gating deficit in ADHD and schizophrenias patients. Methods: Three groups were compared: 24 adults with ADHD, 24 patients with schizophrenia and 24 healthy subjects. The Sensory Gating Inventory (SGI), a validated self-report questionnaire, was used to measure perceptual abnormalities related to sensory gating deficit. P50 suppression was measured by P50 amplitude changes in a dual-click conditioning-testing auditory event-related potential procedure. Results: Adults with ADHD had significantly higher scores on the SGI and significantly lower P50 suppression than healthy subjects. These deficits were similar to those found in patients with schizophrenia. A correlation was found between both the SGI and P50 suppression data in adults with ADHD and patients with schizophrenia. Discussion: The findings confirm previous results found in patients with schizophrenia.

Abnormal neurophysiologic responses to repetitive stimuli gave rise to clinically abnormal perceptions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","ADHD; Adult; P50 suppression; Perceptual anomalies; Self-report; Sensory gating","Adler, L.E., Hoffer, L.D., Wiser, A., Freedman, R., Normalization of auditory physiology by cigarette smoking in schizophrenic patients (1993) The American Journal of Psychiatry, 150, pp. 1856-1861; Adler, L.E., Pachtman, E., Franks, R.D., Pecevich, M., Waldo, M.C., Freedman, R., Neurophysiological evidence for a defect in neuronal mechanisms involved in sensory gating in schizophrenia (1982) Biological Psychiatry, 17, pp. 639-654; (2000) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder, , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC; Baker, N., Adler, L.E., Franks, R.D., Waldo, M., Berry, S., Nagamoto, H., Neurophysiological assessment of sensory gating in psychiatric inpatients: Comparison between schizophrenia and other diagnoses (1987) Biological Psychiatry, 22, pp. 603-617; Biederman, J., Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A selective overview (2005) Biological Psychiatry, 57, pp. 1215-1220; Boutros, N.N., Belger, A., Midlatency evoked potentials attenuation and augmentation reflect different aspects of sensory gating (1999) Biological Psychiatry, 45, pp. 917-922; Braff, D.L., Geyer, M.A., Sensorimotor gating and schizophrenia.

We here present a case report of a patient suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, who was abusing Datura stramonium over a prolonged period. Case summary: A 32year old male presented with aggressive behaviour, irritability for 6years and regular intake of Datura seeds for 3years. After taking detailed history and mental status examination (MSE), diagnoses of paranoid schizophrenia and mental and behavioral disorder due to use of hallucinogen were made. He had shown improvement on standard treatment with antipsychotics. Conclusion: D. stramonium is recognized among emerging new psychoactive substances being used across the world. Among various theories we discuss self-medication hypothesis as a mediating factor for this case. Though D. stramonium is notorious for its life threatening sequelae, clinicians should be aware of its chronic abuse as self-medication. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Abuse; Comorbidity; Datura stramonium; Non-fatal; Schizophrenia; Self-medication","Arnett, A.M., Jimson weed (Datura Stramonium) poisoning (1995) Clinical Toxicology Review, 18 (3); Arouko, H., Matray, M.D., Braganca, C., Mpaka, J.P., Chinello, L., Castaing, F., Bartou, C., Poisot, D., Voluntary poisoning by ingestion of Datura stramonium.

The goal of the current study was to investigate precise abnormalities in two aspects of cognitive control: reactively changing a prepared response, and monitoring performance and adjusting behavior accordingly. We adapted an oculomotor task from neurophysiological studies of the cellular basis of cognitive control in nonhuman primates. Methods: 16 medicated outpatients with schizophrenia (SZ) and 18 demographically-matched healthy controls performed the modified double-step task. In this task, participants were required to make a saccade to a visual target. Infrequently, the target jumped to a new location and participants were instructed to rapidly inhibit and change their response. A race model provided an estimate of the time needed to cancel a planned movement. Response monitoring was assessed by measuring reaction time (RT) adjustments based on trial history. Results: SZ patients had normal visually-guided saccadic RTs but required more time to switch the response to the new target location. Additionally, the estimated latency of inhibition was longer in patients and related to employment. Finally, although both groups slowed down on trials that required inhibiting and changing a response, patients showed exaggerated performance-based adjustments in RTs, which was correlated with positive symptom severity. Conclusions: SZ patients have impairments in rapidly inhibiting eye movements and show idiosyncratic response monitoring. These results are consistent with functional abnormalities in a network involving cortical oculomotor regions, the superior colliculus, and basal ganglia, as described in neurophysiological studies of non-human primates using an identical paradigm, and provide a translational bridge for understanding cognitive symptoms of SZ. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Cognitive control; Response inhibition; Response monitoring; Saccades; Schizophrenia; Stop-signal","Andreasen, N.C., (1983) The scale for the assessment of negative symptoms (SANS), , The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA; Andreasen, N.C., (1984) The scale for the assessment of positive symptoms (SAPS), , The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA; Badcock, J.C., Michie, P.T., Johnson, L., Combrinck, J., Acts of control in schizophrenia: Dissociating the components of inhibition (2002) Psychological Medicine, 32, pp. 287-297; Band, G.P., van der Molen, M.W., Logan, G.D., Horse-race model simulations of the stop-signal procedure (2003) Acta Psychologica (Amst), 112, pp. 105-142; Barch, D.M., Braver, T.S., Carter, C.S., Poldrack, R.A., Robbins, T.W., CNTRICS final task selection: Executive control (2009) Schizophrenia Bulletin, 35, pp. 115-135; Barch, D.M., Ceaser, A., Cognition in schizophrenia: Core psychological and neural mechanisms (2012) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 16, pp. 27-34; Barton, J.J., Cherkasova, M.V., Lindgren, K.A., Goff, D.C., Manoach, D.S., What is perseverated in schizophrenia?

A number of human diseases such as Huntington disease and schizophrenia are known to have cortical pathology involving dopamine receptor expressing neurons. To illuminate their functional role, we exploited a Cre/Lox molecular paradigm to generate Emx-1tox MUT mice, a transgenic line in which cortical Drd1a-expressing pyramidal neurons were selectively ablated.Emx-1tox MUT mice displayed prominent forelimb dystonia, hyperkinesia, ataxia on rotarod testing, heightened anxiety-like behavior, and age-dependent abnormalities in a test of social interaction. The latter occurred in the context of normal working memory on testing in the Y-maze and for novel object recognition. Some motor and behavioral abnormalities in Emx-1tox MUT mice overlapped with those in CamKIIαtox MUT transgenic mice, a line in which both striatal and cortical Drd1a-expressing cells were ablated. Although Emx-1tox MUT mice had normal striatal anatomy, both Emx-1tox MUT and CamKIIαtox MUT mice displayed selective neuronal loss in cortical layers V and VI. This study shows that loss of cortical Drd1a-expressing cells is sufficient to produce deficits in multiple motor and behavioral domains, independent of striatal mechanisms. Primary cortical changes in the D1 dopamine receptor compartment are therefore likely to model a number of core clinical features in disorders such as Huntington disease and schizophrenia. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","D1-dopamine receptor; Dystonia; Huntington disease; Schizophrenia; Targeted cell deletion","Abi-Dargham, A., Moore, H., Prefrontal DA transmission at D1 receptors and the pathology of schizophrenia (2003) Neuroscientist, 9, pp. 404-416; Abi-Dargham, A., Prefrontal dopamine D1 receptors and working memory in schizophrenia (2002) J.

The selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) raloxifene preserves neural activity during memory in healthy older men and improves memory in schizophrenia. Here, we tested the extent to which raloxifene modifies neural activity during learning in schizophrenia. Nineteen people with schizophrenia participated in a twelve-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over adjunctive treatment trial of the SERM raloxifene administered orally at 120 mg daily to assess brain activity during probabilistic association learning using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Raloxifene improved probabilistic association learning and significantly increased fMRI BOLD activity in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus relative to placebo. A separate region of interest confirmatory analysis in 21 patients vs 36 healthy controls showed a positive association between parahippocampal neural activity and learning in patients, but no such relationship in the parahippocampal gyrus of healthy controls. Thus, selective estrogen receptor modulation by raloxifene concurrently increases activity in the parahippocampal gyrus and improves probabilistic association learning in schizophrenia. These results support a role for estrogen receptor modulation of mesial temporal lobe neural activity in the remediation of learning disabilities in both men and women with schizophrenia.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 22 April 2015; doi:10.1038/npp.2015.88. © 2015 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928347022

However, there is a paucity of studies regarding prevalence, clinical diagnostic and treatment in the field. For this review, we performed a focused literature analysis to identify recommendation for the treatment and diagnosis of schizophrenia with comorbid depression. Furthermore, we searched different schizophrenia guidelines for specific treatment recommendations. Due to the complex and heterogeneous picture of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia, the application of standardized assessment tools is recommended. For these purposes, the CDSS (Calgary depression rating scale for Schizophrenia) is such an established tool. In summary, there is only limited evidence for specific treatment recommendations. A change in antipsychotic treatment should usually be preferred before an antidepressant is introduced. In the group of antidepressants, SSRI seem to have some advantages, but most clinical and scientific experience is available for tricyclic antidepressants. Due to the limited original contributions and studies with sufficient methodology, further interventional trials are needed to give specific recommendations with high evidence grades. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG · Stuttgart · New York.",,"Birchwood, M., Iqbal, Z., Upthegrove, R., Psychological pathways to depression in schizophrenia: Studies in acute psychosis, post psychotic depression and auditory hallucinations (2005) Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci, 255, pp. 202-212; Maurer, K., Trendler, G., Schmidt, M., Schizophrenie und Depression (2006) Nervenarzt, 77, pp. 809-822; Van Os, J., Kenis, G., Rutten, B.P., The environment and schizophrenia (2010) Nature, 468, pp. 203-212; Van Os, J., Kapur, S., Schizophrenia (2009) Lancet, 374, pp. 635-645; Mauri, M.C., Bitetto, A., Fabiano, L., Depressive symptoms and schizophrenic relapses: The effect of four neuroleptic drugs (1999) Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry, 23, pp. 43-54; Anderson, G., Berk, M., Dodd, S., Immuno-inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress, and neuroprogressive pathways in the etiology, course, and treatment of schizophrenia (2013) Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry, 42, pp. 1-4; Hasan, A., Falkai, P., Wobrock, T., WFSBP Task force on Treatment Guidelines for Schizophrenia.
