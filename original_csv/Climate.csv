Previous studies on this topic have been limited to the basal surface of graphite. Apparent water-contact angle (WCA) values reported in the literature for the basal surface of graphite or graphene sheet vary from 35° to 126°, due to factors such as surface contamination and roughness. The intrinsic wettability of graphitic carbon remains uncertain. Here we report the first experimental attempt of quantifying the intrinsic wettability of the edge surface of graphite. We show that the basal surface is intrinsically hydrophilic with a WCA of about 61°; the edge surface is more hydrophilic than the basal surface and has an intrinsic WCA likely less than 40°. We also show that the apparent WCA is highly sensitive to sample preparation procedures. Annealing, a commonly used method for removing surface organic contaminants, could result in an underestimated WCA due to oxidation by the trace O<inf>2</inf> in the inert gases. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, many studies only refer to one variety of maize. However, the few studies that include at least two varieties indicate that the respective choice will play a major role in how the yields will develop under a changing climate throughout the 21st century. This study will evaluate how far this choice of variety will affect future yields, identify the main factors to explain potential differences, and determine the magnitude of spatial variability. Results: The results suggest clearly differentiated development paths of all varieties. All varieties show a significant positive trend until the end of the century, though the medium variety also shows a significant decline of 5% during the first 30 years and only a slight recovery towards +5% around the century’s end. The late variety has the clearest and strongest positive trend, with peaks of more than +30% increase of biomass yields and around 25% average increase in the last three decades. The early variety can be seen as in-between, with no negative but also not an as-strong positive development path. All varieties have their strongest increase after the mid of the 21st century. Statistical evaluation of these results suggests that the shift from a summer rain to a winter rain climate in Germany will be the main limiting factor for all varieties. In addition, summer temperatures will become less optimal for all maize crops. As the data suggests, the increasing atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> concentrations will play a critical role in reducing the crops water uptake, thus enabling yield increases in the first place. Conclusions: This study clearly shows that maize yields will develop quite differently under the assumed climatic changes of the 21st century when different varieties are regarded. However, the predominant effect is positive for all discussed varieties and expected to be considerably stronger in the second half of the century. © 2015, Degener and Kappas; licensee Springer.","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Crop yield; Maize varieties; Summer drought","online statistical database, F.A.O.F.A.O., (2014) Rome. 04, 2, p. 2014. , http://faostat3.fao.org; DeStatis, (2013) Statistical Yearbook of Germany 2013, , Statistisches Bundesamt, Wiesbade; Homepage of the Chamber of Agricultre of Lower Saxony: homepage of the Chamber of Agricultre of Lower Saxony (2014) Oldenburg.

The variation in the climate, the geographical location and the rich ethnomedicinal traditions has made the Darjeeling Himalayas an abode of invaluable repository of traditional medicinal plants. In this study, we explored the in vitro anticancer properties of traditionally used medicinal plants from the Darjeeling hills against different human cancer cell lines. Methods: The ethanolic leaf extracts of 30 medicinal plants were tested for their cytotoxicity against human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF 7), human hepatocarcinoma cell line (HepG2) and human cervix adenocarcinoma cell line (HeLa). The cytotoxicity was evaluated by performing MTT assay, trypan blue exclusion assay and morphological assessment under phase contrast inverted microscope. For the extracts which tested positive, IC50 (the concentration that inhibited cell growth by 50%) was calculated. The extract(s) were further subjected to Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) to determine their phytochemical profile. Results: Out of the 30 plant extracts tested, five plants, Artemisia indica, Eupatorium odoratum, Eupatorium adenophorum, Maesa macrophylla and Phlogacanthus thyrsiformis showed a &gt; 50% growth inhibition of cancer cell lines at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. The sensitivity to different extracts varied according to the cell type under investigation. Of these plants, Maesa macrophylla, exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity against HeLa and MCF7 cell with IC50 values of 9.55 μg/ml and 16.19 μg/ml respectively. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of coumarins, flavonoids, tannins, saponins, steroids and terpenes. Conclusions: This is perhaps the first report of screening of traditional medicinal plants from Darjeeling district in West Bengal, India, for their cytotoxic activity against three human cancerous cell lines MCF7, HeLa and HepG2. The extracts of Maesa macrophylla significantly inhibited the growth of HeLa and MCF7 cancerous cell lines and constituted of multiple known biologically active compounds. The present study may provide the landmark for further exploration of M. macrophylla for its potent anticancer constituents. © 2015 Tiwary et al.","Anticancer; Cytotoxicity; Darjeeling; Medicinal plants; Phytochemicals","Jemal, A., Siegel, R., Ward, E., Murray, T., Xu, J., Thun, M.J., Cancer statistics (2007) CA Cancer J Clin, 57, pp. 43-66; Ferlay, J., Shin, H.R., Bray, F., Forman, D., Mathers, C., Parkin, D., Estimates of worldwide burden of cancer in 2008: GLOBOCAN 2008 (2010) Int J Cancer, 127, pp. 2893-2917; Dikshit, R., Gupta, P.C., Ramasundarahettige, C., Gajalakshmi, V., Aleksandrowicz, L., Badwe, R., Cancer mortality in India: a nationally representative survey (2012) Lancet, 379, pp. 1807-1816; Ali, I., Wani, W.A., Saleem, K., Cancer scenario in India with future perspectives (2011) Canc Ther, 8, pp. 56-70; Gullett, N.P., Ruhul Amin, A.R., Bayraktar, S., Pezzuto, J.M., Shin, D.M., Khuri, F.R., Cancer prevention with natural compounds (2010) Semin Oncol, 37, pp. 258-281; Shah, U., Shah, R., Acharya, S., Acharya, N., Novel anticancer agents from plant sources (2013) Chin J Nat Med, 11 (1), pp. 16-23; Cragg, G.M., Newman, D.J., Plant as source of anticancer agents (2005) J Ethnopharmacol, 100, pp. 72-79; Cirla, A., Mann, J., Combrestatins: from natural product to drug discovery (2003) Nat Prod Rep, 20, pp. 558-564; Luduena, R.F., Multiple form of tubulin: different gene products and covalent modification (1998) Int Rev Cytology, 178 (13), pp. 207-275; Itokawa, H., Wang, X., Lee, K.-H., Homoharringtonine and related compounds.

Within a spring-sown wheat crop, we artificially increased temperature by 2. °C and precipitation by 10% in a short-term (April to August 2013) replicated open-field experiment and examined the impacts on coleopteran (mainly Carabidae) diversity and 'activity-densities'. Diversity indices decreased as a result of warming but were not affected by extra precipitation. We found a significant increase in activity-densities of the four most trapped species due to warming, which was responsible for observed changes in diversity. However, Staphylinidae beetles were negatively affected by the warming treatments while other, less common species were not affected. We provide the first experimental evidence of climate-driven impacts on an important farmland insect community. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of biological control and top-down effects across trophic levels. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Agro-ecosystem; Biocontrol; Carabidae; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Global warming","Altermatt, F., Climatic warming increases voltinism in European butterflies and moths (2010) Proc.

Reforestation could affect responses of litter decomposition to warming by altering litter type and soil conditions. However, less is known about the interactive impacts of forest management and climate change on litter decomposition. Here, we conducted a 4-year field experiment to investigate the effects of experimental warming on the decomposition of dragon spruce ( Picea asperata Mast.) and red birch ( Betula albo-sinensis Burk.) foliar litter in two contrasting sites (a dragon spruce plantation and a natural forest) using litter-bag method on the eastern Tibetan Plateau of China. During the four years of decomposition in the field, a clear pattern of faster mass loss was observed in red birch litter compared to dragon spruce needle. Additionally, regardless of warming regimes and litter types, mass loss rates were higher in the natural forest site than in the plantation site. Warming did not affect mass loss of dragon spruce litter during the early decomposition stage, but increased it over the later decomposition stage. In contrast, warming had enhanced mass loss of red birch litter on most sampling days. Red birch litter was more sensitive to warming compared with dragon spruce needle. Our results clearly indicated that reforestation can alter litter quality and soil conditions, and further affect the litter decomposition of subalpine forest ecosystem to projected climatic warming. This calls for incorporating forest management practice in climate-carbon models to better understand carbon dynamics of forest ecosystems under climate change. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Experimental warming; Litter decomposition; Natural forest; Plantation; Reforestation; Tibetan Plateau","Aerts, R., Climate, leaf litter chemistry and leaf litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems: a triangular relationship (1997) Oikos, 79, pp. 439-449; Aerts, R., De Caluwe, H., Nutritional and plant-mediated controls on leaf litter decomposition of Carex species (1997) Ecol., 78, pp. 244-260; Aerts, R., The freezer defrosting: global warming and litter decomposition rates in cold biomes (2006) J.

The caterpillars of autumnal and winter moths have episodic outbreaks, which can occasionally lead to extensive defoliation of birch forests. Earlier studies have shown that reindeer have a negative effect on the regeneration of defoliated birches by grazing and browsing their seedlings and sprouts. Case description: We interviewed 15 reindeer herders in the Kaldoaivi and Paistunturi herding co-operative in northernmost Finland in order to analyse their past, present and future views on the behaviour of moths and the growth of mountain birches. We investigate the behaviour of the two herbivores by combining the indigenous knowledge (IK) of Sámi herders with the results of relevant studies in biology and anthropology, applying niche construction theory (NCT) in doing so. Discussion and evaluation: In the first stage, the niche constructors (moths, reindeer, herders, mountain birch and other organisms) are looked upon as “equal constructors” of a shared niche. As changes unfold in their niche, their role changes from that of constructor to key constructor. The role and importance of niche constructors were different when nomadic pasture rotation was used than they are today under the herding co-operative system. Niche construction faced its most radical and permanent negative changes during the border closures that took place over the latter half of the 19th century. The large-scale nomadic life among the Sámi herders, who migrated between Finland and Norway, came to an end. This phase was followed by stationary herding, which diminished the possibilities of reindeer to look for various environmental affordances. Difficult snow conditions or birch defoliation caused by moth outbreaks made the situation worse than before. Eventually reindeer became key constructors, together with moth larvae, leading to negative ecological inheritance that forced herders to use new, adaptive herding practices. Conclusions: Both the scientific data and the IK of herders highlight the roles of reindeer and herders as continuous key constructors of the focal niche, one which stands to be modified in more heterogenic ways than earlier due to global warming and hence will result in new ecological inheritance. © 2015, Vuojala-Magga and Turunen; licensee Springer.","Autumnal moth; Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii; Climate change; Global warming; Indigenous knowledge (IK); Mountain birch destruction; Niche construction theory (NCT); Professional knowledge; Reindeer herding; Winter moth","Ammunét, T., (2011) Trophic interactions of invasive forest herbivores and consequences for resident ecosystem.

However, increased energy consumption, operator energy cost and the potential environmental impact of increased greenhouse gas emissions and the exhaustion of non-renewable energy resources (fossil fuel) pose major challenges to cellular network operators. The specific power supply needs for rural base stations (BSs) such as cost-effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and reliability can be satisfied by taking advantage of the technological advances in renewable energy. This study investigates the possibility of decreasing both operational expenditure (OPEX) and greenhouse gas emissions with guaranteed sustainability and reliability for rural BSs using a solar photovoltaic/diesel generator hybrid power system. Three key aspects have been investigated: (i) energy yield, (ii) economic factors and (iii) greenhouse gas emissions. The results showed major benefits for mobile operators in terms of both environmental conservation and OPEX reduction, with an average annual OPEX savings of 43% to 47% based on the characteristics of solar radiation exposure in Malaysia.

Knowing that DSF performs well in winter at hot and dry climates as thermal mass is needed. However, this method during summer evinces overheating between the two skin layers. This paper introduces some modifications in order to improve the functioning of DSF when overheating occurs in the cavity between the two skin layers. Overheating in DSF can be prevented by using properties of wind pressure. Considering the condition of the wind flow, different geometric forms in the upper part of DSF as well as its lower portion of window opening are evaluated. The numerical method and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are used in order to evaluate the hypotheses of this study. The obtained results of this research suggest that dividing the cavity space into smaller parts makes no significant changes. Designing an additional channel in the northern part of the models, directly impacts the functionality of DSF, which can be concluded to be very efficient. Finally, by increasing airflow velocity within the cavity, it is possible to decrease the problems of using DSF in hot and dry climates. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Airflow; Building envelope; CFD; Double skin facades; Hot and dry climates; Overheating","De Gracia, A., Castell, A., Navarro, L., Oró, E., Cabeza, L.F., Numerical modelling of ventilated facades: a review (2013) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 22, pp. 539-549; Iyi, D., Hasan, R., Penlington, R., Underwood, C., Double skin façade: modelling technique and influence of venetian blinds on the airflow and heat transfer (2014) Appl Therm Eng, 71, pp. 219-229; Fuliotto, R., Cambuli, F., Mandas, N., Bacchin, N., Manara, G., Chen, Experimental and numerical analysis of heat transfer and airflow on an interactive building façade (2010) Energy Build, 42, pp. 23-28; Shameri, M.A., Alghoul, M.A., Sopian, K., Fauzi, M., Zain, M., Elayeb, O., Perspectives of double skin façade systems in buildings and energy saving (2011) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 15, pp. 1468-1475; Hashemi, N., Fayaz, R., Sarshar, M., Thermal behavior of a ventilated double skin facade in hot arid climate (2010) Energy Build, 42, pp. 1823-1832; Safer, N., Woloszyn, M., Jacques Roux, J., Three dimensional simulation with a CFD tool of the airflow phenomena in single floor double skin facade equipped with a venetian blind (2005) Sol Energy, 79, pp. 193-203; Ding, W., Hasemi, Y., Yamada, T., Natural ventilation performance of a double skin facade with a solar chimney (2005) Energy Build, 37, pp. 411-418; Roth, K., Lawrence, T., Brodrick, J., Double skin facades (2007) ASHRAE J, 15 (OCTOBER), pp. 70-73; Baldinelli, G., Double skin facades for warm climate regions: analysis of a solution with an integrated movable shading system (2009) Build Environ, 44, pp. 1107-1118; Faggembau, D., Costa, M., Soria, M., Oliva, A., Numerical analysis of the thermal behaviour of glazed ventilated facades in Mediterranean climates, part II: applications and analysis of results (2003) Sol Energy, 75, pp. 229-239; Gratia, E., De Herde, A., Optimal operation of a south double skin façade (2004) Energy Build, 36, pp. 41-60; Hossegen, R., Wachenfeldt, B.J., Hanssen, S.O., Building simulation as an assisting tool in decision making, case study: with or without a double skin facade?

Understanding the spatial patterns of temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q<inf>10</inf>) and its controlling factors is very important to quantify the climate-carbon cycle feedback at regional scales. In this study, we conducted a synthesis of 74 field measurements on Q<inf>10</inf> value across China's forests. Based on the overall data, the Q<inf>10</inf> values ranged from 1.10 to 5.18, with a mean value of 2.51. Moreover, the largest relative frequency of Q<inf>10</inf> values was within the range of 2.0-3.0. The Q<inf>10</inf> value in China's forests was significantly and negatively correlated with mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation. However, the Q<inf>10</inf> values increased with latitude and altitude but there was no obvious relationship between Q<inf>10</inf> and longitude. There were no significant differences in Q<inf>10</inf> among evergreen coniferous forest, coniferous-broadleaved mixed forest, deciduous broadleaved forest and deciduous coniferous forest. However, the Q<inf>10</inf> of evergreen broadleaved forest was significantly lower than that of evergreen coniferous forest and deciduous coniferous forest. The findings may advance our understanding on the different environmental controls of Q<inf>10</inf> of soil respiration and also improve our ability to predict regional-scale soil carbon flux in a changing world. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","China; Climate; Forest ecosystems; Q<inf>10</inf>; Spatial variation","Aber, J.D., Ollinger, S.V., Driscoll, C.T., Modeling nitrogen saturation in forest ecosystems in response to land use and atmospheric deposition (1997) Ecol.

An accurate geometrical representation of the wind tunnel test set-up was recreated in the numerical modelling. Experimental results for the indoor and external airflow, supply rate, and pressure coefficients were compared with the numerical results. Smoke visualisation experiment was also conducted to further analyse the detailed airflow structure within the wind catcher and also inside the test room. Following the successful validation of the benchmark CFD model, cylindrical Heat Transfer Devices (HTD) were integrated into the uni-directional wind catcher model to reduce the temperature of air induced into the ventilated space. The findings of the CFD study displayed that the proposed wind catcher was capable of reducing the supply temperature by up to 12K within the micro-climate depending on the outdoor air speed.

This interpretation relies mainly on cosmic-ray exposure dating of glacial deposits. Recent studies, however, have established new production rates for cosmogenic Be and He, which make it necessary to update all chronologies in this region and revise our understanding of cryospheric responses to climate variability. Here we present a new Be moraine chronology in Colombia showing that glaciers in the northern tropical Andes expanded to a larger extent during the Antarctic cold reversal (14,500 to 12,900 years ago) than during the Younger Dryas. On the basis of a homogenized chronology of all Be and He moraine ages across the tropical Andes, we show that this behaviour was common to the northern and southern tropical Andes. Transient simulations with a coupled global climate model suggest that the common glacier behaviour was the result of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation variability superimposed on a deglacial increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. During the Antarctic cold reversal, glaciers advanced primarily in response to cold sea surface temperatures over much of the Southern Hemisphere. During the Younger Dryas, however, northern tropical Andes glaciers retreated owing to abrupt regional warming in response to reduced precipitation and land-surface feedbacks triggered by a weakened Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Conversely, glacier retreat during the Younger Dryas in the southern tropical Andes occurred as a result of progressive warming, probably influenced by an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Considered with evidence from mid-latitude Andean glaciers, our results argue for a common glacier response to cold conditions in the Antarctic cold reversal exceeding that of the Younger Dryas. ©2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

These changes should in turn affect soil formation processes. The aim of this study was to identify possible consequences for soils in a dry-alpine region with respect to weathering of primary minerals and leaching of elements under expected vegetation and climate changes. To achieve this, a field empirical approach investigating an altitudinal sequence was used in combination with laboratory weathering experiments simulating several scenarios. The study sites are located in Sinks Canyon and Stough Basin of the Wind River Range, Wyoming, USA. The following sites (from moist to dry with increasing temperature along the sequence) were investigated: 10 soil profiles (Typic Haplocryoll) in a tundra ecotone, 10 soil profiles (Ustic Haplocryoll) in a pine-fir forest and 20 soil profiles (Ustic Argicryoll) in sagebrush. All soils developed on granitoid moraines. Soil mineralogy was analysed using cathodoluminescence and X-ray diffraction. This revealed that biotite and plagioclase were both weathered to smectite while plagioclase also weathered to kaolinite. Cooler, wetter, altitude-dependent conditions promoted weathering of primary minerals. Furthermore, the soils of the tundra and forest zone exhibited a higher acidity and more organic carbon.In a series of wet laboratory batch experiments, materials from topsoils (A horizons) and subsoils (B horizons) in each ecotone were examined alone or in combination with other samples. In a first step, aqueous extracts of the topsoil samples were generated in batch reactors and analysed for the main ions. In a second and a third step the topsoil extracts were reacted with the subsoil samples of the same ecotone, and with the subsoil samples of the ecotones at higher altitude. The total duration of these batch experiments was 1800. h, and the solutes were measured using ICP-OES and ion chromatography. Dissolved Ca, Mg and K were mainly controlled by the chemical weathering of oligoclase, K-feldspar and biotite. With increasing altitude the total concentrations of Ca, Mg and K in the aqueous extracts decreased, the relative ionic contribution from K decreased, while the ionic contribution from Ca increased.Climate change (warming, changed precipitation) potentially will reduce weathering intensity, soil acidity and the content of organic carbon. An altitudinal shift in vegetation due to climate change seems to affect the ionic composition of the soil solution. In the case of a shift from forest to sagebrush and tundra to forest or sagebrush, the relative contribution from K would increase at the expense of Ca. We hypothesise that K will play an important role in future biogeochemical cycles under the assumptions of climate warming and subsequent vegetation shifts to higher altitudes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Alpine region; Climate change; Feldspar; Vegetation change; Weathering; Wind River Range","Adams, H.D., Guardiola-Claramonte, M., Barron-Gafford, G.A., Villegas, J.C., Breshears, D.D., Zou, C.B., Troch, P.A., Huxman, T.E., Temperature sensitivity of drought-induced tree mortality portends increased regional die-off under global-change type drought (2009) Proc.

In this work, we use the paradigm of climate modeling to present the key problems found by standard applications to be run in hybrid distributed computing infrastructures and propose a framework to allow a climate model to take advantage of these resources in a transparent and user-friendly way. Furthermore, an implementation of this framework, using the Weather Research and Forecasting system, is presented as a working example. In order to illustrate the usefulness of this framework, a realistic climate experiment leveraging Cluster, Grid and Cloud resources simultaneously has been performed. This test experiment saved more than 75% of the execution time, compared to local resources. The framework and tools introduced in this work can be easily ported to other models and are probably useful in other scientific areas employing data- and CPU-intensive applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The bedding micro climate has a greater impact on thermal comfort for subjects with bedding covers during the sleeping period compared with the indoor thermal environment. To investigate the effect of the bedding micro climate on sleep quality and thermal comfort during sleep under different indoor operative temperature and to obtain the appropriate indoor operative temperature and bedding micro climate temperature that satisfies sleep thermal comfort, the mean skin temperature (MST) and bedding temperature (BT) of each subject during the sleep period were measured in this experiment. The thermal sensation vote (TSV) and thermal comfort vote (TCV) of pre-sleep, post-sleep and bed micro climate were investigated simultaneously. The results indicated that the thermal neutral temperature of pre-sleep and post-sleep TSV was 18.3°C. The subjects' comfortable temperature ranges of pre-sleep and post-sleep TCV were 15.8°C-20.6°C and 15.8-18.3°C, respectively. The operative temperature of 15.8°C was thermally neutral and comfortable during sleep. A BT of 30°C-30.8°C was considered a comfortable temperature range during the sleep period, and the corresponding indoor operative temperature was 14.5°C-17.5°C. The subjects' TSV of bedding micro climate was neutral when the mean bedding temperature (MBT) was 30.4°C. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bedding micro climate; Indoor operative temperature; Sleep thermal comfort;

The forestry sector, with its long time laps between decisions to plant and harvesting stands, is among the most relevant to investigate in this respect. This contribution analyzes the results of a survey conducted in Wallonia (Belgium) among private forest owners (PFO) and an array of organizations, both public and private, that influence these owners' actions. The objective of our research is to investigate already implemented or envisaged practices of climate change adaptation as well as the adaptive capacity of these PFOs. In this respect, adaptive capacity is defined as "". the ability of systems, institutions, humans and other organisms to adjust to potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to consequences (of climate change)"" (. IPCC, 2014, p. 2).The results show that different ways of (not) integrating climate change in forest management are visible in the sample of PFOs that can be divided into different profiles of (non) adapters. Analyzing these profiles reveals the influence of multiple objective and sociocognitive factors contributing to the PFOs adaptive capacity. The way climate change adaptation is conceived and implemented by other forest and timber actors has also repercussions on adaptive capacity as some adaptive measures are promoted and facilitated while others are hindered. These results bring fruitful aspects for understanding concrete adaptive processes and are relevant for decision-making as they point out some strengths or weaknesses in terms of adaptive capacity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive capacity; Adaptive practice; Climate change; Forest management; Wallonia","Adger, W.N., Dessai, S., Goulden, M., Are there social limits to adaptation to climate change?

This paper attempted to achieve both goals through the use of intervention-oriented evaluation of a professional development program intended to diagnose and correct students' misconceptions of climate change. Data was gathered, monitored and analyzed in three stages of a time-series design: the baseline, treatment and follow-up stages. The evaluation itself was the 'intervention' such that the data was allowed to 'contaminate' the treatment. This was achieved through giving the teacher unimpeded access to the collected information and to introduce midcourse corrections as she saw fit to her instruction. Results showed a significant development in students' conceptual understanding only after the teacher's decision to use direct and explicit refutation of misconceptions. Due to the accessibility of feedback, it was possible to locate specifically at which point in the process that the intervention was most effective. The efficacy of the intervention was then measured through comparing the scores across the three research stages. The inclusion of a comparison group to the design is recommended for future studies. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Classroom-based evaluation; Climate change; Intervention-oriented evaluation; Misconceptions; Time-series design","Bloom, H.S., Using ""short"" interrupted time-series analysis to measure the impacts of whole-school reforms with applications to a study of accelerated schools (2003) Evaluation Review, 27 (1), pp. 3-49; Boon, H.J., Climate change?

Drawing from transaction cost economics, political economy, and market theory, it does so by looking at the history of three programs for curbing pollution in the United States - the Clean Air Act, the leaded gasoline phase-out, and water permits in Wisconsin. The article begins by briefly summarizing the history of each of these programs before looking at a host of challenges related to political compromises in program design, transaction costs, spatial distortions (such as geographic sensitivity and wrong-way trading of credits), temporal distortions (such as the episodic nature of pollution and volatility of market prices), and market abuses. These concerns are raised with an eye for how historical experience may inform the current debate about how to design effective market mechanisms to respond to climate change and other forms of energy-related environmental degradation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Emissions reduction credits; Market mechanisms; Pollution permits; Tradable permits","Abramsky, K., Introduction: racing to ""save"" the economy and the planet (2010) Sparking a worldwide energy revolution: social struggles in the transition to a post-petrol world, pp. 5-30. , Koyla Abramsky AK Press Oakland; Adair, S.K., Hoppock, D.C., Jonas, J.M., New source review and coal plant efficiency gains: how new and forthcoming air regulations affect outcomes (2014) Energy Policy, 70, pp. 183-192; Adler, J., Free and Green: a new approach to environmental protection (2001) Harv.

The Information Diffusion Model (IDM) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) were applied to the spatial risk analysis of excessive rainfall based on the Tourism Climate Index (TCI) for North Cyprus. The probability of excessive rainfall was calculated using the IDM. The data were then inserted into the TCI formula to estimate the risk analysis of tourism climate for each station on the island. The spatial pattern of climate-related risks to tourism prepared using geo-statistical techniques with GIS software, revealed that the northern borders of the island are exposed to a high levels of precipitation, with resulting adverse effects on tourism. Risk assessments of the tourism climate, spatial-temporal analyses using the TCI, and climate insurance are suggested as adaptive strategies to address seasonality issues. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Geo-statistical technique; GIS; Mathematical approach; North cyprus; Spatial pattern","Amelung, B., Nicholls, S., Implications of climate change for tourism in Australia (2014) Tourism Management, 41, pp. 228-244; Amelung, B., Viner, D., Mediterranean tourism: exploring the future with the tourism climatic index (2006) Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 14 (4), pp. 349-366; Amengual, A., Homar, V., Romero, R., Ramis, C., Alonso, S., Projections for the 21st century of the climate potential for beach-based tourism in the Mediterranean (2014) International Journal of Climatology, 34 (13), pp. 3481-3498; Assaker, G., Examining a hierarchical model of Australia's destination image (2014) Journal of Vacation Marketing, 20 (3), pp. 195-210; Bafaluy, D., Amengual, A., Romero, R., Homar, V., Present and future climate resources for various types of tourism in the Bay of Palma, Spain (2013) Regional Environmental Change, pp. 1-12; Becken, S., Hay, J.E., (2007) Tourism and climate change, , Multilingual Matters; Becken, S., Zammit, C., Hendrikx, J., Developing climate change maps for tourism essential information or awareness raising?

As state employment declines, many residents are exploring the potential of tourism; Cuban entrepreneurs are interested in expanding beyond packaged mass tourism to develop more creative tourism products. However, the success of Cuban entrepreneurs is dependent on a number of conditions external to the entrepreneur known as the entrepreneurial climate (EC). Building on previous entrepreneurship research, this study utilizes interviews of a small group of tourism stakeholders in Cuba to address the research question - what are the perceptions of tourism stakeholders of both barriers to and factors encouraging private enterprise. It concludes with recommendations for planning and policy based on these perceptions that may cultivate entrepreneurial tourism development in Cuba, including improved internet access, development of both wholesaling and financing systems, business education, and legalization of additional tourism professions. Recommendations from the informants also align with recent initiatives in other centrally-governed nations (e.g. China, Singapore, and Bolivia) that have introduced private enterprise to their economies recently. These initiatives could serve as models for Cuba moving forward. © 2015.","Entrepreneurial climate; Marketing; Political climate; Private enterprise; Tourism entrepreneur","Alvarez, A., Cuba gets high-speed Internet, kind of (2013) ABC News, , http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/cuba-high-speed-internet/story?id=18286118#.UYujgEoWQuc, Retrieved from; Anfuso, G., Williams, A.T., Cabrera Hernández, J.A., Pranzini, E., Coastal scenic assessment and tourism management in western Cuba (2014) Tourism Management, 42, pp. 307-320; Ateljevic, J., Li, L., Tourism entrepreneurship - concepts and issues (2009) Tourism and entrepreneurship, pp. 10-32. , Routledge, New York, NY, J.

However, how so drastic changes induced by wildfires and how the age of the burnt scar affect the small and meso-scale atmospheric boundary layer dynamics are largely unknown. These questions are relevant for process analysis, meteorological and air quality forecast but also for regional climate analysis. Such questions are addressed numerically in this study on the case of the Portugal wildfires in 2003 as a testbed. In order to study the effects of burnt scars, an ensemble of numerical simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting modeling system (WRF) have been performed with different surface properties mimicking the surface state immediately after the fire, few days after the fire and few months after the fire. In order to investigate such issue in a seamless approach, the same modelling framework has been used with various horizontal resolutions of the model grid and land use, ranging from 3.5. km, which can be considered as the typical resolution of state-of-the art regional numerical weather prediction models to 14. km which is now the typical target resolution of regional climate models.The study shows that the combination of high surface heat fluxes over the burnt area, large differential heating with respect to the preserved surroundings and lower surface roughness produces very intense frontogenesis with vertical velocity reaching few meters per second. This powerful meso-scale circulation can pump more humid air from the surroundings not impacted by the wildfire and produce more cloudiness over the burnt area. The influence of soil temperature immediately after the wildfire ceases is mainly seen at night as the boundary-layer remains unstably stratified and lasts only few days. So the intensity of the induced meso-scale circulation decreases with time, even though it remains until full recovery of the vegetation. Finally all these effects are simulated whatever the land cover and model resolution and there are thus robust processes in both regional climate simulations and process studies or short-time forecast. However, the impact of burnt scars on the precipitation signal remains very uncertain, especially because low precipitation is at stake. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Mediterranean region; Water cycle; Wildfires","Amiro, B., MacPherson, J., Desjardins, R., BOREAS flight measurements of forest-fire effects on carbon dioxide and energy fluxes (1999) Agric.

In shaded areas, direct shortwave radiation fluxes decrease and a cooling effect is produced. The percentage and position of shaded areas in an open space depend on sun position and urban morphology, so they change during the day, affecting attendance distribution over time. The study assessed the relationship between daily shading patterns, attendance and thermal comfort during summer at San Silvestro square in Rome, Italy. Field investigations were conducted on 1st and 2nd August 2014, including meteorological measurements and unobtrusive observations. The assessment of thermal comfort was based on the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET), calculated using the RayMan model. The majority of visitors at San Silvestro square sought shaded locations when sitting, resulting in a variation of attendance throughout the day. The attendance in unshaded location passed from 0 to 2 people at 11:00 to 2-10 at 12:00, whereas the attendance in shaded locations had a minimum of 0-4 at 12:00 and a maximum of 52-94 at 18:00. This preference was strongly correlated with thermal comfort analysis, as PET values were significantly lower in shaded areas. The minimum difference in the median of PET from shaded and unshaded locations was 2°C at 18:00 and the maximum difference was 7°C at 11:00. The main findings of this study highlight the importance of considering daily shading pattern when renovating open spaces in Mediterranean climate and can be used as reference for future renovations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Mediterranean climate; Open space design; Outdoor thermal comfort; Physiologically Equivalent Temperature; Shading; Summer heat stress","Madanipour, A., Why are the design and development of public spaces significant for cities?

In addition to summer cooling, plants can insulate buildings against heat loss in winter. Research was conducted over two winters using replicated small-scale physical models to simulate heat loss from a built structure and to investigate the insulation properties of plants during cold weather. Brick cuboids were constructed around a water tank maintained at 16°C and energy use monitored. Covering cuboids with ivy (Hedera helix) reduced mean energy consumption by 21% compared to bare cuboids during the first winter (means of 4.3 and 5.4kWh per week, respectively). During the second winter, when foliage was more extensive a 37% mean saving was achieved (3.7 compared to 5.9kWh per week). The presence of Hedera enhanced brick temperatures significantly compared to bare walls. Temperature differences were affected by weather parameters, aspect, diurnal time and canopy density. Largest savings in energy due to vegetation were associated with more extreme weather, such as cold temperatures, strong wind or rain. Under such scenarios green façades could increase energy efficiency by 40-50% and enhance wall surface temperatures by 3°C. These empirical studies with replicated treatments augment previous research based on urban modelling and data from non-replicated individual buildings in situ. They indicate that planting design requires more attention to ensure the heat saving aspects associated with green façades and shelter belts are optimised. These aspects are discussed within the context of wider urban ecosystem services provided by vegetation, and implications for climate change mitigation. © 2015 The Authors.","Energy efficiency; Green facade; Green wall; Retrofitting buildings; Thermal performance; Winter energy saving","Clark, J.A., Johnstone, C.M., Kelly, N.J., Strachan, P.A., Tuohy, P., The role of built environment energy efficiency in a sustainable UK energy economy (2008) Energy Policy, 36, pp. 4605-4609; Pérez-Lombard, L., Ortiz, J., Pout, P., Areview on buildings energy consumption information (2008) Energy Build, 40, pp. 394-398; Baggott, S.L., Cardenas, L., Garnett, E., Jackson, J., Mobbs, D.C., Murrells, T., (2007) UK greenhouse gas inventory: 1990-2005, , UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, London; Pauleit, S., Ennos, R., Golding, Y., Modeling the environmental impacts of urban land use and land cover change - a study in Merseyside, UK (2005) Landsc Urban Plan, 71, pp. 295-310; Gill, S.E., Handley, J.F., Ennos, A.R., Pauleit, S., Adapting cities for climate change: the role of the green infrastructure (2007) Built Environ, 33, pp. 115-133; Cameron, R.W.F., Taylor, J.E., Emmett, M.R., What's 'cool' in the world of green façades?

During migration, monarchs use orientation mechanisms, exploiting a time-compensated sun compass and a light-sensitive inclination magnetic compass to facilitate fall migration south. The sun compass is bidirectional with overwintering coldness triggering the change in orientation direction for remigration northward in the spring. The timing of the remigration and milkweed emergence in the southern US have co-evolved for propagation of the migration. Current research is uncovering the anatomical and molecular substrates that underlie migratory-relevant sensory mechanisms with the antennae being critical components. Orientation mechanisms may be detrimentally affected by environmental factors such as climate change and sensory interference from human-generated sources. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Dingle, H., (2014) Migration: The Biology of Life on the Move, , Oxford University Press. edn 2; Zhu, H., Gegear, R.J., Casselman, A., Kanginakudru, S., Reppert, S.M., Defining behavioral and molecular differences between summer and migratory monarch butterflies (2009) BMC Biol, 7, p. 14; Merlin, C., Gegear, R.J., Reppert, S.M., Antennal circadian clocks coordinate sun compass orientation in migratory monarch butterflies (2009) Science, 325, pp. 1700-1704; Guerra, P.A., Merlin, C., Gegear, R.J., Reppert, S.M., Discordant timing between antennae disrupts sun compass orientation in migratory monarch butterflies (2012) Nat Commun, 3, p. 958; Guerra, P.A., Reppert, S.M., Coldness triggers northward flight in remigrant monarch butterflies (2013) Curr Biol, 23, pp. 419-423; Mouritsen, H., Derbyshire, R., Stalleicken, J., Mouritsen, O.Ø., Frost, B.J., Norris, D.R., An experimental displacement and over 50 years of tag-recoveries show that monarch butterflies are not true navigators (2013) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 110, pp. 7348-7353; Guerra, P.A., Gegear, R.J., Reppert, S.M., A magnetic compass aids monarch butterfly migration (2014) Nat Commun, 5, p. 4164; Nesbit, R.L., Hill, J.K., Woiwod, I.P., Sivell, D., Bensusan, K.J., Chapman, J.W., Seasonally adaptive migratory headings mediated by a sun compass in the painted lady, Vanessa cardui (2009) Anim Behav, 78, pp. 1119-1125; Stefanescu, C., Páramo, F., Akesson, S., Alarcón, M., Ávila, A., Brereton, T., Carnicer, J., Heliölä, Multi-generational long-distance migration of insects: studying the painted lady butterfly in the Western Palaearctic (2013) Ecography, 36, pp. 474-486; Chapman, J.W., Reynolds, D.R., Mouritsen, H., Hill, J.K., Riley, J.R., Sivell, D., Smith, A.D., Woiwod, I.P., Wind selection and drift compensation optimize migratory pathways in a high-flying moth (2008) Curr Biol, 18, pp. 514-518; Alerstam, T., Chapman, J.W., Bäckman, J., Smith, A.D., Karlsson, H., Nilsson, C., Reynolds, D.R., Hill, J.K., Convergent patterns of long-distance nocturnal migration in noctuid moths and passerine birds (2011) Proc R Soc B, 278, pp. 3074-3081; Chapman, J.W., Lim, K.S., Reynolds, D.R., The significance of midsummer movements of Autographa gamma: implications for a mechanistic understanding of orientation behavior in a migrant moth (2013) Curr Zool, 59, pp. 360-370; Reppert, S.M., Gegear, R.J., Merlin, C., Navigational mechanisms of migrating monarch butterflies (2010) Trends Neurosci, 33, pp. 399-406; Merlin, C., Heinze, S., Reppert, S.M., Unraveling navigational mechanisms in migratory insects (2012) Curr Opin Neurobiol, 22, pp. 353-361; Guilford, T., Taylor, G.K., The sun compass revisited (2014) Anim Behav, 97, pp. 135-143; El Jundi, B., Pfeiffer, K., Heinze, S., Homberg, U., Integration of polarization and chromatic cues in the insect sky compass (2014) J Comp Physiol A, 200, pp. 575-589; Heinze, S., Reppert, S.M., Sun compass integration of skylight cues in migratory monarch butterflies (2011) Neuron, 69, pp. 345-358; Heinze, S., Reppert, S.M., Anatomical basis of sun compass navigation.

The continuous records of groundwater level, temperature and electrical conductivity from a transect perpendicular to the coastline were studied during a period ranging from summer to winter, together with the information obtained in hydrogeomorphological field surveys and soil profiles. An assessment of the processes conditioning marsh hydrology was carried out contemplating seasonal (summer-winter) and periodical variations caused by tidal flows. The study showed that the dynamics of groundwater in relation to tidal flows depends almost exclusively on the infiltration of tidal water when the marsh is flooded during spring tides (syzygy), with an increase in the groundwater discharge level at the onset of syzygy. The differences in temperature between sea and continental water were very useful in defining the origin of the different contributions. Groundwater salinity is mainly associated with the leaching of the soil salts that enter with the sea water infiltrating during flood events. The presence of saline soils in the marsh is regulated by the evapotranspiration predominating in arid zones. The conceptual hydrological model suggested may help in the understanding of the hydrological processes in other similar marshes of Patagonia, as well as in coastal wetlands of arid zones worldwide. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Arid climate; Hydrodynamics; Patagonia; Playa fracasso; Salt marsh","Aguirre, M., Negro Sirch, Y., Richiano, S., Late Quaternary molluscan assemblages from the coastal area of Bahía Bustamante (Patagonia, Argentina): paleoecology and paleoenvironments (2005) J.South Am.

Over the past decade it witnessed rapid growth. Single-family housing is a popular option in Jordan. The construction sector consumes large amounts of energy and resources. Green and energy efficient buildings are growing in popularity and there are policies adopted to encourage energy efficient buildings. These buildings are often justified based on energy saving during the operation phase. Nevertheless, up to date, there is no study that analyses the efficiency of these buildings in Jordan from a life cycle perspective. In this study, the six most popular construction configurations for a single family house in Jordan are assessed using ""cradle to grave"" life cycle methodology. The alternatives included: single hollow concrete block (Economic), double layer hollow concrete blocks (improved economic), double layer hollow concrete blocks with insulation layer (insulated economic), typical limestone cladding, insulated limestone wall and multi-layer with limestone cladding and insulation (luxury). The results show that using the typical Jordanian family thermal comfort level and heating and cooling patterns, the economic house is the option that performs best in terms of energy resources (5050 UBP), climate change (727.85Mg CO<inf>2 eq</inf>), acidification (2.91Mg SO<inf>2 eq</inf>) and particulate matter formation (1.14Mg PM<inf>10 eq</inf>). Limestone cladded houses show better results in terms of human toxicity and water depletion impact. The results further suggest that energy resource and water depletion impacts may be used as proxy indicators for the overall performance of the building. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy efficient buildings; Exterior wall; LCA; Single family house; Stone wall","http://www.jib.jo/IndustrySectors/ConstructionBuildingMaterials/tabid/99/language/en-US/Default.aspx, Available:, [accessed 18.02.15]Horvath, A., Construction materials and the environment (2004) Annu Rev Environ Resour, 29, pp. 181-204; http://www.who.int/heli/pilots/jordan/en/, Available:, [accessed 18.02.15]Monteiro, H., Freire, F., Life-cycle assessment of a house with alternative exterior walls: comparison of three impact assessment methods (2012) Energy Build, 47, pp. 572-583; Adalberth, K., Energy use during the life cycle of buildings: a method (1997) Build Environ, 32, pp. 317-320; Sartori, I., Hestness, A., Energy use in the life cycle of conventional and low energy buildings: a review article (2007) Energy Build, 40, pp. 249-257; Radhi, H., Sharples, S., Global warming implications of facade parameters: a life cycle assessment of residential buildings in Bahrain (2013) Environ Impact Assess Rev, 38, pp. 99-108; Maria Kolokotroni, M., Robinson-Gayle, S., Tanno, S., Cripps, A., Environmental impact analysis for typical office facades (2004) Build Res Inform, 32, pp. 2-16; (2009) Climate conscious architecture and urban design in Jordan - towards energy efficient buildings and improved urban microclimate, , Housing Development & Management and the Royal Scientific Society, Sweden, Lund, [Report 12], E.

The impact of users' actions and habits on buildings energy efficiency is well established and documented. However, there is a lack of available information concerning the relationship between user behaviour, building airtightness and ventilation. This paper explores the results of a large experimental campaign, which included: airtightness measurements by fan pressurization of flats; continuous CO<inf>2</inf> measurements, and a questionnaire regarding tenants' habits. Forty nine apartments from two different social housing neighbourhoods, one of them recently rehabilitated, were used as case study. Non-rehabilitated flats presented an average ACH<inf>50</inf> of 8.9h-1 while the rehabilitated flats presented an average of 6.8h-1. The impact of user behaviour in airtightness levels was investigated and, in the rehabilitated case study, the average ACH<inf>50</inf> was 4.3h-1 in modified flats and 7.7h-1 in non-modified. This can have important consequences on the indoor environment as the average ACH found in a modified flat, ranged from 0.35h-1, in December to 1.01h-1 in August, showing the importance of window opening in the actual ventilation rates. The standard methods for estimating average ventilation rates were applied to the sample and results compared with measurements, indicating a need to adapt currently used methodologies to adequately include user effect. The complexity of human behaviour is a challenge for designers and therefore increasing the knowledge of user actions and habits is decisive for building better homes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Airtightness;

Plant species that inhabit these environments integrate responses to broadly fluctuating wetness conditions. Indirect assessment of contrasting habitat wetness based on plant indicator values, species frequency, and species coverage was carried out in two sites representing the larch (Larix sibirica) and pine (Pinus sylvestris) forest-steppe communities. For the larch forest-steppe, we found that plant community composition and spatial structure depended strongly on wetness. In addition, we found that the vegetation was clearly differentiated into forest stands and steppe communities, depending on the slope aspect. There was also a strong correlation between dissimilarities of species composition and differences in habitat wetness revealed in the larch forest-steppe. In contrast, soil properties, such as gravel and stone content were found to be a key factor in the spatial distribution of plant species composition in the pine-forest-steppe communities. Indirect assessment of moisture conditions in the forest-steppe habitats, based on the field-layer plant species, was found to be preferable for indicating soil water deficits in the forest. Furthermore, as long-term observational data is often lacking, indirect assessment of the forest-steppe vegetation provides an opportunity to identify vulnerable forests at the marginal distribution. Based on indirect assessments of soil-moisture conditions, and taking into account differences in potential drought resistance between larch and pine forests, we concluded that increasing aridity will cause the replacement of Siberian larch by Scots pine in the South Siberian forest-steppe landscape. Consequently, in the future it is likely that forest-steppe typological diversity will decrease, and the semi-arid landscape may become more monotonous. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Forest vulnerability; Forest-steppe; Habitat wetness; Larch forest; Pine forest; Plant distribution patterns; Plant indicator values; Semi-arid vegetation; Southern Siberia","Allen, C.D., Breshears, D.D., Climate-induced forest dieback as an emergent global phenomenon (2007) Eos Trans.

Chief among these are daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations. Relatively small in terms of real physical values, temperature fluctuations of just a few degrees can profoundly affect organismal functions. In vertebrates, temperature is detected by primary afferents of somatosensory neurons, which express thermo-gated ion channels. Most of our knowledge about temperature receptors comes from seminal studies in mice and rats. Recent work uncovered thermosensory mechanisms in other vertebrates, shedding light onto the diversity of thermosensory adaptations. Here, we summarize molecular mechanisms of thermosensation in different species and discuss the need to use the standard laboratory rodents and non-standard species side-by-side in order to understand fundamental principles of somatosensation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Julius, D., TRP channels and pain (2013) Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol, 29, pp. 355-384;

In this study, the maize yield potentials from 1980 to 2008 across the major maize production regions of China were firstly estimated by county using ensemble simulation of a well-validated large scale crop model, i.e., MCWLA-Maize model. Then, the temporal and spatial patterns of maize yield potentials and yield gaps during 1980-2008 were presented and analyzed. The results showed that maize yields became stagnated at 32.4% of maize-growing areas during the period. In the major maize production regions, i.e., northeastern China, the North China Plain (NCP) and southwestern China, yield gap percentages were generally less than 40% and particularly less than 20% in some areas. By contrast, in northern and southern China, where actual yields were relatively lower, yield gap percentages were generally larger than 40%. The areas with yield gap percentages less than 20% and less than 40% accounted for 8.2% and 27.6% of maize-growing areas, respectively. During the period, yield potentials decreased in the NCP and southwestern China due to increase in temperature and decrease in solar radiation; by contrast, increased in northern, northeastern and southeastern China due to increases in both temperature and solar radiation. Yield gap percentages decreased generally by ~2% per year across the major maize production regions, although increased in some areas in northern and northeastern China. The shrinking of yield gap was due to increases in actual yields and decreases in yield potentials in the NCP and southwestern China; and due to larger increases in actual yields than in yield potentials in northeastern and southeastern China. The results highlight the importance of sustainable intensification of agriculture to close yield gaps, as well as breeding new cultivars to increase yield potentials, to meet the increasing food demand. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Agronomic management; Climate change; Food security; Impact; Water stress; Yield potential","Asseng, S., Ewert, F., Rosenzweig, C., Uncertainty in simulating wheat yields under climate change (2013) Nat.

These systems are operated to provide comfortable thermal conditions for building occupants. The common practice of defining operational settings for HVAC systems is to use fixed set points, which assume occupants have static comfort requirements. However, thermal comfort has been shown to vary from person to person and also change over time due to climatic variations or acclimation. In this paper, we introduce an online learning approach for modeling and quantifying personalized thermal comfort. In this approach, we fit a probability distribution to each comfort condition (i.e., uncomfortably warm, comfortable, and uncomfortably cool) data set and define the overall comfort of an individual through combing these distributions in a Bayesian network. In order to identify comfort variations over time, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used on the joint probability distributions. In order to identify comfortable environmental conditions, a Bayesian optimal classifier is trained using online learning. In order to validate the approach, we collected data from 33 subjects, and an average accuracy of 70.14% and specificity of 76.74% were achieved. In practice, this approach could transform the comfort objectives to constrain functions and prevents pareto optimality problems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive stochastic modeling; Commercial buildings; Online learning; Personalized comfort; Probabilistic modeling; Thermal comfort","(2010) B.E.D.

However, the direct warming effects on microbial communities are uncertain due to the confounding effects of plant traits and soil heterogeneities. Here, we exposed alpine meadow soil microcosms to temperature between 10 and 40. °C for 28 days, to evaluate the temperature relationship of the bacterial community structure and microbial functions. Our results showed that sustained exposure to contrasting temperature produced compositionally and functionally distinct microbial communities. The degree of these changes was dependent on the magnitude of warming, as shown by a consistent increase in the dissimilarities and a shift of the carbon (C) use pattern along the temperature gradient. We found that the bacterial community temporal dynamics followed a gradual process of succession, and the turnover rate was substantially accelerated (. P=. 0.012) by warmer temperatures; every 1. °C elevation in soil temperature was estimated to increase the turnover by 0.001. Consistently, contrasting temperature was found to be the dominant factor explained 6.1% of the total variation of the microbial community structures; however, the incubation duration and the interaction between incubation temperature and duration explained 5.4% and 4.1% of the variation, respectively. As anticipated, the shift in bacterial community rapidly translated to a similar change in enzymes activities and C utilization. In addition, potential indicator species were screened; these species characterized the temperature gradient. Collectively, our findings indicate that direct warming effects on soil bacterial community could substantially alter certain function and that contrasting temperatures would accelerate the bacterial community turnover-temperature relationship in this alpine meadow soil. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Bacterial community; Contrasting temperature; Indicator species; Temperature relationship; Turnover rate","Allison, S.D., Martiny, J.B., Resistance, resilience, and redundancy in microbial communities (2008) Proc.

Robustness of response options was investigated by applying a 'stress-testing' method which evaluated expected performance against combined scenarios of socioeconomic and climate change. Based upon stakeholder feedback, a reference scenario representing current trends in climate and socioeconomic drivers ('business-as-usual') was used as a dynamic baseline against which to compare results of other scenarios. The robustness of response options was evaluated by their utility in different environmental and social contexts as represented by the scenarios, and linked to their adaptability to adjust to changing conditions. Key findings demonstrate that adaptability becomes increasingly valuable as the magnitude and rate of future change diverges from current trends. Stress-testing also revealed that individual responses in isolation are unlikely to be robust meaning there are advantages from integrating cohesive combinations (bundles) of response options to maximise their individual strengths and compensate for weaknesses. This identifies a role for both top-down and bottom-up responses, including regulation, spatial targeting, incentives and partnership initiatives, and their use in combination through integrated assessment and planning consistent with the adoption of an Ecosystem Approach. Stress-testing approaches can have an important role in future-proofing policy appraisals but important knowledge gaps remain, especially for cultural and supporting ecosystem services. Finally, barriers and enablers to the implementation of more integrated long-term adaptive responses were identified drawing on the '4 Is' (Institutions, Information, Incentives, Identity) conceptual framework. This highlighted the crucial but usually understated role of identity in promoting ownership and uptake of responses. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cross-scale responses; Decision-making; Ecosystem services; Integrated assessment; Integrated responses; Policy appraisal; Scenario analysis","Adelle, C., Jordan, A., Turnpenny, J., Proceeding in parallel or drifting apart?

An ideal statistical downscaling numerical experiment was performed for surface winds above complex terrain in Israel's northern Negev desert region. Dynamical downscaling have been performed by the WRF model to create a historical database by the following two sets. The first set used 5 nested domains from 40.5km to 0.5km. The second set used 3 nested domains ranging from 40.5km to 4.5km. The 4.5km data (stage 2) was defined as predictors while data on 0.5km (stage 1) served as predictands for statistical downscaling. Two statistical downscaling algorithms: minimal distance analog and a Bayesian inference aided analog (hereafter Bayesian algorithm) were tested by the above data. Unlike most analog algorithms, the Bayesian algorithm refers to the probability to get the best analog instead of the minimal differences between predictands. The comparison of the two algorithms shows that the Bayesian approach yields improved results. The Bayesian algorithm reproduces the 0.5km resolution dynamically downscaled surface winds with an average absolute direction difference of 43 and 20 for calm winds and moderate/strong winds respectively. Its average wind speed error is 1.1ms-1. 40days are sufficient to create a representative database. Given the database, the procedure is extremely fast (a few seconds) and easy to operate, which makes it suitable for real-time non-expert fast-response applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Complex terrain; Numerical weather prediction; Statistical downscaling","Alpert, P., Osetinsky, I., Ziv, B., Shafir, H., A new seasons definition base on classified daily synoptic systems: an example for the eastern Mediterranean (2004) Int.

Whilst its use has been widely reported in the area of social programmes, it is less applied in the field of energy and climate change policy evaluations. This paper reports a recent study that has evaluated the effectiveness of the national biofuel policy (NBP) for the transport sector in Malaysia by adapting a TBE approach. Three evaluation criteria were derived from the official goals of the NBP, those are (i) improve sustainability and environmental friendliness, (ii) reduce fossil fuel dependency, and (iii) enhance stakeholders' welfare. The policy theory underlying the NBP has been reconstructed through critical examination of the policy and regulatory documents followed by a rigorous appraisal of the causal link within the policy theory through the application of scientific knowledge. This study has identified several weaknesses in the policy framework that may engender the policy to be ineffective. Experiences with the use of a TBE approach for policy evaluations are also shared in this report. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Malaysia; National biofuel policy; Theory-based evaluations","Abdullah, A., Salamatinia, B., Mootabadi, H., Bhatia, S., Current status and policies on biodiesel industry in Malaysia as the world's leading producer of palm oil (2009) Energy Policy, 37, pp. 5440-5448; Abdul-Manan, A.F., Baharuddin, A., Chang, L.W., A detailed survey of the palm and biodiesel industry landscape in Malaysia (2014) Energy, 76, pp. 931-941; Abdul-Manan, A.F., Baharuddin, A., Chang, L.W., Ex-post critical evaluations of energy policies in Malaysia from 1970 to 2010: A historical institutionalism perspective (2015) Energies, 8 (3), pp. 1936-1957; (2006) Worldwide fuel charter; Basiron, Y., The palm-oil advantage in biofuel (2007) New Straits Times, (FEBRUARY), p. 22; Brinkmann, A., (2009) GHG emissions from palm oil production: Literature review and proposals for amendment of RSPO principles & criteria.

The objectives of this approach were to explore the 3D extension of isolated permafrost bodies and to relate this to surface parameters such as soils and humus forms and other extrinsic factors. Using this procedure, interdependencies between surface (soil properties and humus forms) and subsurface factors (ground thermal regime and frozen ground conditions) could be independently analysed. Although time-consuming, 3D ERI (electrical resistivity imaging) demonstrated its ability for precise permafrost mapping. Despite climate warming, super-cooling in winter along the investigated scree slopes is still efficient enough for establishing permafrost conditions. By comparing the spatial dimensions of the permafrost bodies with surface conditions, we found that thick moss or organic litter layers had an insulating effect and prevented the permafrost from melting. However, the comparison of soil units and soil thickness with the permafrost distribution did not always show an obvious relationship. This indicates that there is a complex evolution and behaviour of soils and permafrost at such sites. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","3D electrical resistivity imaging; Frozen ground conditions; Humus forms; Permafrost; Soil distribution","Online Systematics, , http://www.humusformen.de/, (accessed 13 August 2014); Alvarez-Uria, P., Körner, C., Low temperature limits of root growth in deciduous and evergreen temperate tree species (2007) Funct.

Our goal was to analyze how the length of wetting events and the presence of BSC determine soil variables related to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in a semiarid ecosystem. We applied three watering treatments (one, six and ten days) on soils from two microsites (BSC and bare ground) in a microcosm experiment. We analyzed multiple variables related to N and C cycling (N in microbial biomass [MB-N], dissolved organic nitrogen [DON], NH<inf>4</inf>+-N, NO<inf>3</inf>--N, resin-NH<inf>4</inf>+-N and resin-NO<inf>3</inf>--N, phenols and carbohydrates). For all treatments, minimum DON concentration appeared earlier in BSC than in bare ground, while maximum NO<inf>3</inf>- peaks appeared earlier in BSC than in the bare ground. Increases of NH<inf>4</inf>+ were only perceptible under BSC. Our results showed that longer lasting wetting events kept higher mineral and organic N as well as labile organic C in soils under BSC, which suggest that longer wetting events may be related to an enhancement in the decomposition rate that compensate for nutrient losses associated to short lasting wetting events. This trend is much less obvious in bare ground than under BSC. Our data suggest that changes in the length of wetting events and the presence of BSC with climate changes could alter future soil community structure and function. © 2015.","Carbon cycle; DON; Drylands; Microbial biomass-N; Mineralization rate; Nitrogen cycle","Allison, S.D., Martiny, J.B., Resistance, resilience, and redundancy in microbial communities (2008) Proc.

In order to provide new constraints to this debate, we studied the kaolinite occurrence at Penestin in the southern part of the Armorican Massif using several approaches, including field and petrological observations, mineralogical analyses (XRD) and stable oxygen-hydrogen isotope analyses. An alteration profile was developed from faulted micaschists showing, from the bottom to the top of the profile, a reddish saprolite zone with pure white kaolinite fissures cutting across the schistosity and a white kaolinite zone, 5-10m thick. The detailed study by XRD of the layer silicates enabled us to characterize a mineralogical sequence with increasing alteration intensity, which is coherent with a weathering evolution: mica, chlorite→illite/vermiculite (chlorite) mixed-layer mineral→vermiculite→vermiculite/kaolinite mixed-layer mineral→kaolinite. Moreover, an intense iron leaching process occurs within the kaolinite zone, which is characterized by a bleaching of this zone combined with iron oxyhydroxide precipitation along/within fractures and cracks. The isotopic analyses of kaolinite from the zone and fissures gave δ18O values ranging from 19.64 to 21.21‰, and δD values ranging from -69.4 to -65.8‰. This confirms that kaolinite was formed by low-temperature water-rock interactions in contact with meteoric fluids during weathering processes. Isotopic and stratigraphic data suggest that this weathering occurred before the Messinian (~7Ma) and probably dates back to the Eocene, during which the climate was sub-tropical at this location. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Kaolinite; Micaschist; Paleoenvironment; Stable isotope; Weathering; XRD","Aspandiar, M., Eggleton, R., Weathering of chlorite: I.

Box 123, Broadway, NSW, Australia","The flowering time of wheat is strongly controlled by temperature and is potentially highly sensitive to climate change. In this study, we analysed the occurrence of last frost (days with minimum temperature under 2. °C) and first heat (days with maximum temperatures exceeding 30. °C) events of the year to determine the optimum flowering date in the wheat belt of New South Wales (NSW), eastern Australia. We used statistically downscaled daily maximum and minimum temperature data from 19 Global Climate Models (GCMs) with a vernalizing-photothermal model in order to simulate future flowering dates and the changes in frost and hot days occurrence at flowering date (± 7 days) for two future scenarios for atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in 2040s (2021-2060) and 2080s (2061-2100). Relative to the 1961-2000 period, the GCMs projected increased daily maximum and minimum temperatures for these future periods, accompanied by reduced frost occurrence and increased heat stress incidence. As a consequence, by the 2080s, simulations suggest a general advance in spring wheat flowering date by, on average, 10.2 days for RCP4.5 and 17.8 days for RCP8.5 across the NSW wheat belt. Winter wheat flowering dates were delayed by an average of 2.4 days for RCP4.5 and 14.3 days for RCP8.5 in the warmest parts of the region (the northwest) due to reduced cumulative vernalization days (requiring cool conditions). In the cooler regions (the northeast, southeast and southwest), flowering date occurred earlier by 6.2 days for RCP4.5 and 6.7 days for RCP8.5 on average. Moreover, in the western parts of the wheat belt the delay of winter wheat flowering date was about 9.5 days longer than that in the eastern parts. As a result of phenological responses to increasing temperatures, current wheat varieties may not be suitable for future climate conditions, despite reduced frost risk. In the future, it may be necessary to use longer-season wheat varieties and varieties with increased heat-stress resistance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Frost days; Hot days; NSW wheat belt; Vernalizing-photothermal model; Wheat phenology","Amano, T., Smithers, R.J., Sparks, T.H., Sutherland, W.J., A 250-year Index of First Flowering Dates and Its Response to Temperature Changes (2010) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences: rspb20100291; Anderson, W., Smith, W., Yield advantage of two semi-dwarf compared with two tall wheats depends on sowing time (1990) Crop Pasture Sci., 41 (5), pp. 811-826; Angus, J., Mackenzie, D., Morton, R., Schafer, C., Phasic development in field crops II: thermal and photoperiodic responses of spring wheat (1981) Field Crops Res., 4, pp. 269-283; Asseng, S., Foster, I., Turner, N.C., The impact of temperature variability on wheat yields (2011) Global Change Biol., 17 (2), pp. 997-1012; Asseng, S., Pannell, D.J., Adapting dryland agriculture to climate change: farming implications and research and development needs in Western Australia (2013) Climatic Change, 118 (2), pp. 167-181; Bishop, C.H., Abramowitz, G., Climate model dependence and the replicate Earth paradigm (2013) Climate Dyn., 41 (3-4), pp. 885-900; Brooking, I., Jamieson, P., Temperature and photoperiod response of vernalization in near-isogenic lines of wheat (2002) Field Crops Res., 79 (1), pp. 21-38; Butterfield, R.E., Morison, J.I., Modelling the impact of climatic warming on winter cereal development (1992) Agric.

In addition, thermoelectric, refinery, cement and chemistry industries are concentrated in the southern part of the valley, near Mexico City. Several studies have reported air, soil, and water pollution data and its main sources for the region. Paradoxically, these sources contaminate the valley, but boosted its economic development. Nevertheless, no research has been done concerning GHG emissions, or climate change assessment. This paper reports inventories performed by the 1996 IPCC methodology for the baseline year 2005. Fuel consumption data were derived from priority sectors such as electricity generation, refineries, manufacturing & cement industries, transportation, and residential use. The total CO<inf>2</inf> emission result was 13,894.9Gg, which constituted three-quarters of Hidalgo statewide energy category. The principal CO<inf>2</inf> sources were energy transformation (69%) and manufacturing (19%). Total black carbon emissions were estimated by a bottom-up method at 0.66Gg. The principal contributor was on-road transportation (37%), followed by firewood residential consumption (26%) and cocked brick manufactures (22%). Non-CO<inf>2</inf> gas emissions were also significant, particularly SO<inf>2</inf> (255.9Gg), which accounts for 80% of the whole Hidalgo State emissions. Results demonstrated the negative environmental impact on Mezquital Valley, caused by its role as a Megacity secondary fuel and electricity provider, as well as by the presence of several cement industries. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Black carbon; Emission inventory; GHG; Mezquital Valley; Non-CO<inf>2</inf> gases","Åström, S., Tohka, A., Bak, J., Lindblad, M., Arnell, J., Potential impact on air pollution from ambitious national CO<inf>2</inf> emission abatement strategies in the Nordic countries - environmental links between the UNFCCC and the UNECE-CLRTAP (2013) Energy Policy, 53, pp. 114-124; Bachmann, J., (2009) Black Carbon: A Science/Policy Primer, , Pew Center on Global Climate Change, Arlington, USA, VISION AIR CONSULTING L (Ed.); Ban-Weiss, G.A., Lunden, M.M., Kirchstetter, T.W., Harley, R.A., Size-resolved particle number and volume emission factors for on-road gasoline and diesel motor vehicles (2010) J.

However, odour from these facilities continues to be one of the most important concerns in terms of cost & effective mitigation. This paper provides a technological and life cycle assessment of some of the different odour control technologies and treatment methods that can be implemented in organics processing facilities. The technological assessment compared biofilters, packed tower wet scrubbers, fine mist wet scrubbers, activated carbon adsorption, thermal oxidization, oxidization chemicals and masking agents. The technologies/treatment methods were evaluated and compared based on a variety of operational, usage and cost parameters. Based on the technological assessment it was found that, biofilters and packed bed wet scrubbers are the most applicable odour control technologies for use in organics processing faculties. A life cycle assessment was then done to compare the environmental impacts of the packed-bed wet scrubber system, organic (wood-chip media) bio-filter and inorganic (synthetic media) bio-filter systems. Twelve impact categories were assessed; cumulative energy demand (CED), climate change, human toxicity, photochemical oxidant formation, metal depletion, fossil depletion, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, terrestrial eco-toxicity, freshwater eco-toxicity and marine eco-toxicity. The results showed that for all impact categories the synthetic media biofilter had the highest environmental impact, followed by the wood chip media bio-filter system. The packed-bed system had the lowest environmental impact for all categories. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Biofilter; Composting; Odour control; Organics processing; Wet scrubber","Burgess, J., Parsons, S., Stuetz, R., Burgess, J., Parsons, S., Stuetz, R., Developments in odour control and waste gas treatment biotechnology: a review (2001) Biotechnology Advances, pp. 19-35. , Canfield University, UK; Decottignies, V., Filippi, G., Bruchet, A., Characterisation of odour masking agents often used in the solid waste industry for odour abatement (2007) Water Sci.

A better understanding of the determinants of this indicator is useful in climate policy analysis. This paper introduces four different models to calculate a country's aggregate carbon intensity using the input-output framework. The models are developed based on different combinations of input-output models, country imports assumptions, and approaches to calculating GDP. Using the four models and multiplicative structural decomposition analysis, the determinants of the aggregate carbon intensity change of China from 2007 to 2010 are studied. The results given by the models are compared and attribution analysis on one of the determinants is conducted. The proposed procedure can be similarly applied to study changes in other aggregate intensity indicators, such as the ratio of energy consumption, water consumption or material use of a country to its GDP. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Aggregate carbon intensity; China; Ghosh input-output model; Imports assumptions; Leontief input-output model; Structural decomposition analysis","Twelfth five-year plan for energy development.

That includes also emissions from agricultural sector. Although the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has established a methodology for assessment of GHG emissions from agriculture, the forecasting options are limited, especially when policies and their interaction with the agricultural system are tested. Therefore, an advanced tool, a system dynamics model, was developed that enables assessment of effects various decisions and measures have on agricultural GHG emissions. The model is based on the IPCC guidelines and includes the main elements of an agricultural system, i.e. land management, livestock farming, soil fertilization and crop production, as well as feedback mechanisms between the elements. The case of Latvia is selected for simulations, as agriculture generates 22% of the total anthropogenic GHG emissions in the country. The results demonstrate that there are very limited options for GHG mitigation in the agricultural sector. Thereby, reaching the non-ETS GHG emission targets will be very challenging for Latvia, as the level of agricultural GHG emissions will be exceeded considerably above the target levels. Thus, other non-ETS sectors will have to reduce their emissions drastically to ""neutralize"" the agricultural sector's emissions for reaching the EU's common ambition to move towards low-carbon economy. The developed model may serve as a decision support tool for impact assessment of various measures and decisions on the agricultural system's GHG emissions. Although the model is applied to the case of Latvia, the elements and structure of the model developed are similar to agricultural systems in many countries. By changing numeric values of certain parameters, the model can be applied to analyze decisions and measures in other countries. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural systems; Emission mitigation; Greenhouse gas emissions; Manure management; Modeling complex systems; Nitrogen tax; Policy; System dynamics","Barisa, A., Romagnoli, F., Blumberga, A., Blumberga, D., Future biodiesel policy designs and consumption patterns in Latvia: a system dynamics model (2015) J.

However, bioenergy's impact on climate change remains incomplete when land use changes (LUC), soil organic carbon (SOC) changes, and the auxiliary energy consumption are not accounted for in the life cycle. Using data collected from Belgian farmers, combined heat and power (CHP) operators, and a life cycle approach, we compared 40 bioenergy pathways to a fossil-fuel CHP system. Bioenergy required between 0.024 and 0.204MJ (0.86MJ<inf>th</inf>+0.14 MJ<inf>el</inf>)-1, and the estimated energy ratio (energy output-to-input ratio) ranged from 5 to 42. SOC loss increased the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of residue based bioenergy. On average, the iLUC represented ~67% of the total GHG emissions of bioenergy from perennial energy crops. However, the net LUC (i.e., dLUC+iLUC) effects substantially reduced the GHG emissions incurred during all phases of bioenergy production from perennial crops, turning most pathways based on energy crops to GHG sinks. Relative to fossil-fuel based CHP all bioenergy pathways reduced GHG emissions by 8-114%. Fluidized bed technologies maximize the energy and the GHG benefits of all pathways. The size and the power-to-heat ratio for a given CHP influenced the energy and GHG performance of these bioenergy pathways. Even with the inclusion of LUC, perennial crops had better GHG performance than agricultural and forest residues. Perennial crops have a high potential in the multidimensional approach to increase energy security and to mitigate climate change. The full impacts of bioenergy from these perennial energy crops must, however, be assessed before they can be deployed on a large scale. © 2015 The Authors.","Fixed and fluidized bed CHPs; Life cycle assessment; Perennial crops; Residues","(2009), EU, Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC.

A total of 66 RTUs on 8 different buildings were retrofitted with a commercially available advanced controller for improving operational efficiency. The controller features enhanced air-side economizer control, multi-speed fan control, and demand-controlled ventilation. Of the 66 RTUs, 18 are packaged heat pumps and the rest are packaged air conditioners with gas heat. The eight buildings cover four building types and four climate conditions. Based on the performance data collected for approximately 1. year, the normalized annual energy consumption savings ranged between 22% and 90%, with an average of 57% for all RTUs. The average fractional savings uncertainty was 12% at 95% confidence level. Normalized annual electricity savings were in the range between 0.47. kW. h/h (kW. h per hour of RTU operation) and 7.21. kW. h/h, with an average of 2.39. kW. h/h.

In the Pacific Northwest vegetation fires regularly produce PyC, but its accumulation in soils is poorly quantified. Using mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) and partial least-squares (PLS) analysis in conjunction with ultraviolet photo-oxidation followed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (UV-NMR) techniques, PyC contents were quantified for samples from soil profiles along a vegetation gradient. Sample locations included different forest types as well as sites under agricultural use. While PyC was most prevalent in the first 0.2m with 7-24% of total soil organic C (SOC), it could be found in the subsoil of all locations. However, PyC concentrations did not change consistently with soil depth. Stock sizes were lowest at the Turkey Farm (0.71kgm-2; 10% of SOC) and Organic Growers Farm (1.14kgm-2; 8% of SOC) sites, presumably due to the pervasive combustion of grass and cereals. Among the forested sites, lower stocks were observed at sites with higher mean annual temperature (MAT) and lower mean annual precipitation (MAP) such as Metolius (1.71kgm-2; 15% of SOC) and Juniper (1.89kgm-2; 26% of SOC). In contrast, the highest PyC stocks were found under cooler and moister conditions at Cascade Head dominated by Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)) (5.66kgm-2; 16% of SOC) and Soapgrass Mountain (4.80kgm-2; 15% of SOC). PyC was only moderately related to non-PyC SOC, which comprises plant residues, their decomposition products and soil biota (r2=0.61 and 0.44 for SOC with and without PyC, respectively), suggesting largely independent processes influencing production and disappearance. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Fire; Pyrogenic carbon; Soil development; Soil organic matter","Agee, J.K., Huff, M.H., Fuel succession in a western hemlock/Douglas-fir forest (1987) Can.

Possible future PM<inf>2.5</inf> and O<inf>3</inf> air quality for two land use/land cover change (LULCC) scenarios, reforestation and cropland conversion, are compared to a reference case scenario for the year 2050 using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) models. Changes in air quality driven by changes in climate, deposition and emissions relating to the LULCC are investigated. Reforestation in the Southeast tends to decrease the ambient O<inf>3</inf> mixing ratio while slightly increasing summertime PM<inf>2.5</inf> in the Southeastern U.S. Results of a climate and deposition (CD) sensitivity simulation are provided for the two alternative LULCC scenarios to isolate the impact of changing climate and deposition on PM<inf>2.5</inf> and O<inf>3</inf> air quality. The sensitivity results indicate that deposition and emissions changes associated with reforestation impact O<inf>3</inf> and PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations as much as, and in most cases more than, changes in meteorology. Conversion of forest to cropland in the Southeast, on the other hand, tends to increase O<inf>3</inf> and increase PM<inf>2.5</inf> year-round. Cropland conversion leads to increased NO<inf>X</inf> emissions and increases in the 4th highest maximum daily 8-h O<inf>3</inf> (MDA8) of the year by up to 10ppb despite the tendency for increased deposition and decreased temperature to reduce the MDA8 mixing ratio. The results of this study show that O<inf>3</inf> and aerosol concentrations are sensitive to reforestation and cropland conversion in the Southeast and these land use changes should be considered in air quality management plans. Further, they show the sensitivity of such calculations to land cover properties. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; Climate change; LULCC; Reforestation","Carter, W.P.L., Documentation of the SAPRC-99Chemical Mechanism for VOC Reactivity Assessment (1999), 1, p. 329. , AssessmentSparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions Modeling System (SMOKE) User Manual.

This study investigated stable isotope characteristics of precipitation in the Qinghai Lake Basin, analyzed moisture sources using data sets from NCEP-NCAR, and calculated vapor contributions from lake evaporation to the precipitation in the basin using a two-component mixing model. Results showed that the Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL) was defined as δ2H=7.86 δ18O+15.01, with a slope of less than 8, indicating that some non-equilibrium evaporation processes occurred when the drops fell below the cloud base. Temperature effects controlled δ18O and δ2H in precipitation in the basin, with high values in summer season and low values in winter season. Moisture in the basin was derived predominantly from the Southeast Asian Monsoon (SEAM) from June to August and the Westerly Circulation (WC) from September through May. Meanwhile, the transition in atmospheric circulation took place in June and September. The SEAM strengthened gradually, while the WC weakened gradually in June, and inversely in September. However, the Southwest Asian Monsoon (SWAM) did not reach the Qinghai Lake Basin due to the barrier posed by Tanggula Mountain. High d-excess (>10‰) and significant altitude and lake effects of δ18O in precipitation suggested that the vapor evaporated from Qinghai Lake, strongly influenced annual precipitation, and affected the regional water cycle in the basin distinctly. The monthly contribution of lake evaporation to basin precipitation ranged from 3.03% to 37.93%, with an annual contribution of 23.42% or 90.54mm, the majority of which occurred in the summer season. The findings demonstrate that the contribution of evaporation from lakes to atmospheric vapor is fundamental to water cycling on the TP. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Deuterium excess; Moisture cycling; Precipitation; Stable isotope; The Qinghai Lake Basin","Adams, S., Titus, R., Pietersen, K., Tredoux, G., Harris, C., Hydrochemical characteristics of aquifers near Sutherland in the Western Karoo, South Africa (2001) J.

It is generally understood that instantaneous retrieval of precipitation using microwave sensors is more accurate in the tropics and mid latitudes, but the retrievals become difficult and uncertain at higher latitude and over frozen land. In the lack of reliable microwave-based precipitation estimates at high latitudes, retrievals from a single infrared band are commonly used as an alternative to fill the missing gaps. The present study shows that multi-spectral infrared, near-surface air temperature, and near-surface humidity data can add useful information to that obtained from a single infrared band and can significantly improve delineating precipitating from non-precipitating scenes, especially at higher latitudes over land. The role of surface air temperature and humidity is found to be more effective at higher latitudes, but multispectral data is effective across all latitudes. The study is performed using 4. years (2007-2010) of collocated multi-spectral data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), surface temperature and humidity data from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) analysis, and reference precipitation data from CloudSat, which can detect even very light precipitation within 80°S-80°N. © 2014.","High latitude; Humidity; Multi-spectral; Precipitation; Temperature","Adler, R.F., Negri, A.J., A satellite infrared technique to estimate tropical convective and stratiform rainfall (1988) J.

The rainfall gauge network is still insufficient across significant areas worldwide. Rainfall estimates from spaceborne sensors present an opportunity to supplement the existing network and enable the development of critical, near real time applications.However, the societal benefits of such systems can only be realized if the estimates are properly validated and the performance of existing products accurately described.In this study, two products generated by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) are validated for the Peruvian Andes. This is a region of complex topography that poses significant challenges to the retrieval of rainfall values from space.The TMPA products, both research grade (3B42V7) and near real time (3B42RT), are compared against in situ data. Different observation lengths are studied and the results are analyzed in light of geographic, topographic and climatic constraints. The Time Series of the science grade product were also studied under Dynamic Time Warping and Hierarchical Clustering to streamline inter-tile comparisons.The TMPA products show a good agreement with the gauge values, especially for more prolonged observation periods (over 8 days). The validation results display a strong regional dependence as a consequence of differences in the climate and topography. This region-specific performance calls for additional, detailed case studies and localized validation efforts.Overall the TMPA was found to perform adequately and provide quality information for a number of applications requiring timely estimates in convenient formats. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Peruvian Andes; Rainfall estimates; TMPA; TRMM","Abbuhl, L., Norton, K., Schlunegger, F., Kracht, O., Aldahan, A., Possnert, G., El Niño forcing on 10Be-based surface denudation rates in the northwestern Peruvian Andes?

In this study, the contributions of climate change to spring maize yield over the past three decades in Northeast China were decoupled based on the daily climate variables gathered from 68 meteorological stations and detailed observed data of spring maize from 55 agricultural meteorological experimental stations for the period 1978-2010 in Northeast China, analyzed with a linear statistical model. Then, the key climatic factors limiting the climate-induced yield of spring maize were identified. The agro-climatic similarity theory was applied. Finally, the relationships between the climatic variables and the climate-induced yield of spring maize were further explored by provinces. The results show that: from 1978 to 2010, the observed yields of spring maize in Northeast China increased markedly, with inter-annual fluctuations. Compared with the methods of moving average and harmonic average, Logistic regression optimally decoupled the climate-induced yield of spring maize. The key meteorological factors limiting the climate-induced yield were temperature, precipitation and sunshine, varying in the different regions. In Heilongjiang Province, the climate-induced yields of spring maize were mainly affected by maximum temperatures in August and precipitation in June. In Jilin Province, climate-induced yield was closely related to precipitation during daily the average temperature stably passing 10. °C (≥10. °C). In Liaoning Province, when the maximum temperature was high and the sunshine was abundant in June, the climate-induced yield of spring maize significantly increased. Finally, the regression models between climatic variables and climate-induced yield of spring maize in 11 representative zones in Northeast China also established geographical differences. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Climate-induced crop yield; Northeast China; Relationship; Spring maize","Borkowf, C.B., Computing the nonnull asymptotic variance and the asymptotic relative efficiency of Spearman's rank correlation (2002) Comput.

Despite the influence of SOM chemistry-here defined as soil organic C (SOC) and soil organic N (SON) functional groups and compounds-on decomposition, uncertainty exists regarding the response of SOM chemistry to climate change and associated land use shifts. Here, we adopt a climosequence approach, using latitude along a uniform glacial till deposit at the grassland-forest ecotone in central Canada as a surrogate for the effects of climate change on SOM chemistry. Additionally, we evaluate differences in SOM chemistry from paired native grassland, native trembling aspen (. Populus tremuloides) forest, and arable soil profiles to investigate the effects of likely climate-induced land use alterations.The combination of C and N K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) with pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS) techniques was used to examine SOM chemistry at atomic and molecular scales, respectively. These techniques revealed only modest differences in surface SOM chemistry related to land use and latitude. Greater variation was apparent in the vertical stratification of SOM constituents from soil depth profiles. These findings indicate that pedon-scale processes have greater control over SOM chemistry than do processes operating on landscape (e.g. land use) and regional (e.g. climate) scales. Additionally they imply that SOM chemistry is largely unresponsive to climatic change on the magnitude of the mean annual temperature (MAT) gradient under study (~. 0.7. °C), despite its location at the grassland-forest boundary highlighting its sensitivity, and is similarly unresponsive to associated land use shifts. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Land use; Organic carbon; Organic nitrogen; Soil quality; Vegetation","Baum, C., Eckhardt, K.-U., Hahn, J., Impact of poplar on soil organic matter quality and microbial communities in arable soils (2013) Plant Soil Environ., 59, pp. 95-100; Cooney, R.R., Urquhart, S.G., Chemical trends in the near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure of monosubstituted and para-bisubstituted benzenes (2004) J.

Arundo donax L.) represents a promising opportunity to reduce the fossil fuel dependency of Mediterranean countries. Nevertheless, the response of this crop to future climate projections is an open issue despite the crucial implications for mid-term planning policies. In this study, we present an exploratory analysis of the climate change impact on giant reed productivity in the Lombardy plain (northern Italy), an area that is currently characterized by intensive fodder corn-based cropping systems, but where corn is expected to be negatively affected by projected changes in thermal and pluviometric regimes. A dedicated simulation environment was developed, by coupling Arungro, a process-based model specific to giant reed, to a database including information on the presence of biogas plants, land use, crop management and distribution, in addition to weather scenarios for current climate and future projections. The baseline climate (1975-1994) was obtained from the European Commission MARS database; the Hadley3 and NCAR realizations of the IPCC AR4 emission scenarios A1B and B1 were used to generate 20-year climate projections centred on 2020 and 2050. Spatially distributed simulations were run at a sub-regional scale in areas selected according to their attractiveness for investments and low risk of competition between feed and no-feed crop destinations. The results indicate that an increased local suitability of giant reed in future climate projections is expected in terms of biomass production (+20% in 2020 for all scenarios and +30% in 2050 for Hadley-A1B) and the economic and environmental sustainability of related cropping systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Arundo donax L.; Arungro; Biogas plant; Crop model; Renewable energy; Zea mais L","Porter, R., Semenov, M.A., Crop responses to climatic variability (2005) Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 360 (1463), pp. 2021-2035; Kang, Y., Khan, S., Ma, X., Climate change impacts on crop yield, crop water productivity and food security - a review (2009) Prog Nat Sci, 19 (12), pp. 1665-1674; Lobell, D.B., Field, C.B., Global scale climate-crop yield relationships and the impacts of recent warming (2007) Environ Res Lett, 2 (1), pp. 1-7; Masutomi, Y., Takahashi, K., Harasawa, H., Matsuoka, Y., Impact assessment of climate change on rice production in Asia in comprehensive consideration of process/parameter uncertainty in general circulation models (2009) Agric Ecosyst Environ, 131 (3-4), pp. 281-291; Jones, P.G., Thornton, P.K., The potential impacts of climate change in tropical agriculture: the case of maize in Africa and Latin America in 2055 (2003) Global Environ Change, 13, pp. 51-59; Fernandes, E.C.M., Soliman, A., Confalonieri, R., Donatelli, M., Tubiello, F., (2012) Climate change and agriculture in Latin America, 2020-2050.

This runoff decline intensifies inherent water shortage and results in more severe water use conflicts that are threatening sustainable development in the Loess Plateau. Innovative strategies for more water-efficient land management are essential. To this end, the factors controlling runoff were investigated using the upstream area of the Jing River as an example. Runoff was found to be mainly controlled by evaporative demand, precipitation, and land cover type. Budyko's frameworks were applied to predict the annual and long-term runoff; however, the effect of changes in land management (. e.g., afforestation) on runoff cannot be assessed due to lack of vegetation factors. Therefore, an empirical analysis tool was derived based on an existing relationship for runoff estimation. This method was found to be more effective in reproducing the annual and long-term runoff than others. The incorporation of temporal changes in land cover and form in approach enables the estimation of the possible impact of soil conservation measures (. e.g., afforestation or terracing). Our study highlights the importance of adaptive land management strategies for mitigating water shortage on the Loess Plateau. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Empirical method; Land-use pattern; Runoff reduction; Soil erosion; Water resources management","Brown, A.E., Zhang, L., McMahon, T.A., Western, A.W., Vertessy, R.A., Areview of paired catchment studies for determining changes in water yield resulting from alterations in vegetation (2005) J.Hydrol., 310, pp. 28-61; Budyko, M.I., (1958) The Heat Balance of the Earth's Surface, , U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Weather Bureau, Washington, D.C; Budyko, M.I., (1974) Climate and Life, , Academic Press, New York; Chiew, F.H.S., Estimation of rainfall elasticity of streamflow in Australia (2006) Hydrol.

A simulation study was conducted to assess the vulnerability of wheat (irrigated and rainfed) and maize production due to drought and climate change in the Northeast of Iran. UNEP Aridity Index (AIU) was calculated to measure drought situation in five agricultural centers including Birjand, Bojnourd, Mashhad, Sabzevar and Torbat Heydarieh. Projected changes in climate variables were simulated by two General Circulation Models: HadCM3 and IPCM4 under three scenarios (A1B, A2 and B1), simulated by LARS-WG. The Cropping System Model (CSM)-CERES-Wheat and (CSM)-CERES-Maize were used for crop growth simulation under projected climate conditions. In order to quantify the magnitude of vulnerability to varying drought conditions, vulnerability was considered as a function of sensitivity, well-being state relative to its damage threshold and exposure. Vulnerability was calculated considering severe droughts in the selected years and the expected vulnerability considering the expected frequency of drought. The results showed that in all the study locations the wheat and maize production have been affected extremely by severe droughts during the base period and both crops were extremely sensitive to drought. It was also projected that crop production will be extremely vulnerable to probable droughts during the projected years the same as the base period. © 2015.","Agricultural vulnerability; Climate change; Drought","Adger, W.N., Vulnerability (2006) Glob.

The patterns and trends of decomposition are related to the complex interaction of climate, soil biota and litter quality. The decay dynamics for the European beech are well-known for middle Europe, but lesser investigated in the Mediterranean area. In this study, we investigated mass loss and nutrient dynamics, especially nitrogen and manganese, in two Mediterranean beech forest located in northern and southern Italy. We used a litterbag experiment with leaves of each forest incubated in their own area of origin and vice versa. Moreover, we also used microcosms to follow early stages of decomposition under controlled conditions. The aims of this study were to investigate the role of climate and soil/litter quality at the different stages of decomposition and assess the response of diverse soils to changes in temperature and humidity. The results showed a faster field decomposition for the southern (warmer) site compared to the northern (colder) site, whereas under stable conditions in microcosms this trend reversed, implying different microbial adaptations to climate. Moreover, changes in temperature and humidity triggered complex microbial response during litter decay. Additionally, whereas our results showed trends of nitrogen concentration comparable to previous studies, the role of manganese in decomposition was very relevant even from the early stages. Noticeably, manganese was generally lower in both sites compared to middle Europe, but it was higher in the northern site than in the southern one. Manganese concentration, however, strongly increased for those leaves that had a lower initial content in all conditions, giving evidence of a strong mobilization of this nutrient and its essential role for decomposition in Mediterranean beech forests. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate; Fagus sylvatica; Leaf litter decomposition; Litter quality; Manganese; Microcosms","Albers, D., Migge, S., Schaefer, M., Scheu, S., Decomposition of beech leaves (Fagus sylvatica) and spruce needles (Picea abies) in pure and mixed stands of beech and spruce (2004) Soil Biol.

Most of the research so far has focused on contribution of afforestation to carbon sequestration, afforestation schemes' uptake, social and economic efficiency and their impact on local biodiversity. Less attention has been given so far to the relevant performance of subsidy schemes' specific design in climate change adaptation, an emerging policy objective. This paper investigates adaptive capacity of subsidised afforestation projects in a Central European country. Subsidies are found to be concentrated primarily to highland regions that already have got high forest cover, with Norway spruce as the preferred tree species and a deficit of European beech, an arrangement that may undermine the payment scheme's contribution to land use adaptation to climate change. Lack of clear policy objectives and related technical subsidy design, rather than appropriation towards competing policy goals, appear to be the ultimate reason behind spatial distribution and structure of subsidised projects. Subsidy spending seems to follow recipients' choices instead of any deliberate policy priorities. © 2015 .","Afforestation payments; Common Agricultural Policy; Land cover change; Reforestation","Ammer, U., Comments on primary afforestation in Bavaria - summary (2000) EFI Proceedings, 35, pp. 119-126. , European Forest Institute, Joensuu, N.

Typical physical properties of atmospheric icing and the corresponding meteorological parameters are presented. For computational modeling of ice accretion on turbine blades, the LEWINT code was adopted to simulate ice accretion on an aerofoil for a 2MW wind turbine. Ice sensors and the basic requirements for ice detection on large blades are described. Besides, this paper presents the main passive and active ice mitigation techniques and their advantages and disadvantages. Scope of future work is suggested as wind turbine blades scale up.

This paper provides an economic and financial analysis of a future project in a pumped-storage facility that may be initiated in the Swiss Alps following the glacier retreat. The area released may be considered for building a new reservoir. A complete and integrated model is developed based on the tools of analysis provided by econometrics, finance and operational research. The results show that under the present market conditions such an investment is not profitable. Unexpectedly, the sensitivity analysis shows that most of the time higher price volatility reduces annual revenue. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.Allrightsreserved.","Climate change; Concession; Energy storage; Hydropower; Investment; Mountain; Real options","(2014) World Energy Outlook 2014, , International Energy Agency (IEA) Paris: IEA; (2010) Electric Energy Storage Technology Options: A White Paper Primer on Applications, Costs, and Benefits, , Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) Palo Alto, USA: EPRI; (2014) International Energy Statistics, , http://www.eia.gov, U.S. Energy Information Administration [accessed 10.11.14]; (2014) Hydropower, , http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00490/00491, Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) [accessed 11.11.14]; (1991) Federal Act on the Protection of Waters, , http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/c814_20.html, The Federal Authorities of the Swiss Confederation [accessed 02.10.13]; (2014) Statistique des Aménagements Hydroélectriques de la Suisse, , Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE); (2013) Bewertung von Pumpspeicherkraftwerken in der Schweiz im Rahmen der Energiestrategie 2050, , Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE); Gaudard, L., Romerio, F., The future of hydropower in Europe interconnecting climate, markets and policies (2014) Environ Sci Policy, 37, pp. 172-181; Godde, D., Engels, K., Pump storage power plants between wishful thinking and economic reality (2013) Wasserwirtschaft, 103 (5), pp. 12-15; Sensfuss, F., Ragwitz, M., Genoese, M., The merit-order effect a detailed analysis of the price effect of renewable electricity generation on spot market prices in germany (2008) Energy Policy, 36 (5), pp. 3086-3094; Gaudard, L., Gilli, M., Romerio, F., Climate change impacts on hydropower management (2013) Water Resour Manag, 27 (5), pp. 5143-5156; Gaudard, L., Romerio, F., Dalla Valle, F., Gorret, R., Maran, S., Ravazzani, G., Climate change impacts on hydropower in the Swiss and Italian Alps (2014) Sci Total Environ, 493, pp. 1211-1221; Schaefli, B., Hingray, B., Musy, A., Climate change and hydropower production in the Swiss Alps quantification of potential impacts and related modelling uncertainties (2007) Hydrol Earth Syst Sci, 11 (3), pp. 1191-1205; Maran, S., Volonterio, M., Gaudard, L., Climate change impacts on hydropower in an alpine catchment (2014) Environ Sci Policy, 43, pp. 15-25; Beniston, M., Impacts of climatic change on water and associated economic activities in the Swiss Alps (2012) J Hydrol, 412, pp. 291-296; Haeberli, W., Bütler, M., Huggel, C., Müller, H., Schleiss, A., (2013) Neue Seen Als Folge des Gletscherschwundes im Hochgebirge: Chancen und Risiken, , http://www.vdf.ethz.ch/service/3533/3534_Neue-Seen-als-Folge-des-Gletscherschwundes-im-Hochgebirge_OA.pdf, [accessed 13.09.13]; Haeberli, W., Schleiss, A., Linsbauer, A., Künzler, M., Bütler, M., Gletscherschwund und neue Seen in den Schweizer Alpen perspektiven und optionen im bereich naturgefahren und wasserkraft (2012) Wasser Energie Luft, 104, pp. 93-102; Terrier, S., Jordan, F., Schleiss, A., Haeberli, W., Huggel, C., Künzler, M., Optimized and adapted hydropower management considering glacier shrinkage scenarios in the Swiss Alps (2011) Proceeding of International Symposium on Dams and Reservoirs under Changing Challenges, pp. 497-508. , London: CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group; (2010) Projected Costs of Generating Electricity, , http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/projected_costs.pdf, International Energy Agency (IEA), Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) [accessed 10.11.14]; (2006) Environmental Management - Life Cycle Assessment: European Standard en ISO 14040 and 14044, , International Organization for Standardization; Pehnt, M., Dynamic life cycle assessment (LCA) of renewable energy technologies (2006) Renew Energy, 31 (1), pp. 55-71; Meyer, L., Tsatsaronis, G., Buchgeister, J., Schebek, L., Exergoenvironmental analysis for evaluation of the environmental impact of energy conversion systems (2009) Energy, 34 (1), pp. 75-89; Sciubba, E., Ulgiati, S., Emergy and exergy analyses complementary methods or irreducible ideological options?

Here we present an assessment on current and future habitat suitability distribution of Myristica dactyloides Gaertn. (MD), a medicinally and ecologically important tree species by using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution model. The future predictions were done for the year 2050 and 2070 using the bioclimatic variables having 1. km spatial resolution from two different models of fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP5). This study was carried out in the Kolli hill, Eastern Ghats of India. The AUC values confirmed the accuracy of model prediction based on 22 occurrence points. Environmental variables' contributions were evaluated using jackknife test. The more influencing variables will be annual temperature, annual precipitation and precipitation of wettest month. Finally, this study found that there will be a significant reduction in the habitat suitability distribution of Myristica dactyloides in the year 2050 and 2070 in the study area. Hence with the performance of the model, this study found that MaxEnt could be an effective tool for species rehabilitation and biodiversity conservation planning in the light of climate change. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Habitat suitability; MaxEnt; Myristica dactyloides Gaertn","Adhikari, D., Barik, S.K., Upadhya, K., Habitat distribution modeling for reintroduction of Ilex khasiana Purk., a critically endangered tree species of northeastern India (2012) Ecol.

Carbon trading is a market mechanism and key instrument in the mitigation of climate change. This paper explores the policy process and development state to date of China's carbon-trade market to understand the emergence and development of that market and to understand what barriers are hampering China's carbon-trade market development. To achieve this goal, this paper introduces and analyzes China's status in the international market, examines the factors driving carbon-market launching by the Chinese government, and traces the development of mandatory carbon-emission trading and voluntary emission trading. It is argued that China's carbon-trading market is confronted with challenges such as the absence of a functional carbon-trading market, inaccuracy of the quota allocation, an imperfect trading mechanism, and lagging legislation. At the present stage, shortcomings such as having no real-time carbon price and dominated spot transactions differentiate China's trade market substantially from a functional system. A quick market integration of China's carbon market appears remote. It is suggested that specific measures be taken to promote the development of the Chinese carbon-trading market. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The kinetics of treatment within these wetlands has not been previously characterized which contributes to uncertainties in performance expectations. A case study was conducted on a tundra wetland area receiving primary treated municipal wastewater in Coral Harbour, Nunavut, Canada. The objectives of the study were to: (i) develop a tanks-in-series (TIS) performance model to determine first order areal rate constants (k) for a tundra wetland treatment area; and (ii) compare the rate constants to published literature on treatment wetlands operating in more temperate climates. This study serves as a proof of concept and initial derivation of rate constants characteristic of a tundra wetland treatment area. A TIS performance model was modified to account for external hydrologic contributions. Tracer studies, hydraulic measurements, and water quality data were used to parameterize the model and fit first order rate constants for several wastewater parameters. Dilution from the external hydrologic contributions from the watershed of the wetland accounted for approximately 33% of the contaminant reductions observed. The fitted k values normalized to 20°C, and percentiles compared to literature, ranged from: 4.4-120m/y (5th-70th) for CBOD<inf>5</inf>; 78 -887m/y (40th-90th) for E. coli; 2.7 20m/y (10th-60th) for TN; and 12-64m/y (40th-80th) for TAN.

The DPW consist of two vertical semitransparent walls separated by an air gap. The effect of varying the gap width (b) between glasses, the room temperature and the incident solar radiation is analyzed. Simulations were conducted for three configurations; case 1: clear glass+air gap+clear glass; case 2: clear glass+air gap+absorbent glass; and case 3: clear glass+air gap+reflective glass. Optical transmittance and specular reflectance of each case were measured. Two climatic conditions were analyzed, warm and cold climate. The results showed that, in order to increase or reduce the indoor heat gains, from b≥0.02m, the heat fluxes remains almost constant for both climate conditions. For cold climate, the case 1 reached the highest energy savings (~10.5 and ~28.5% higher than cases 2 and 3, respectively), however in warm climate it had the worst behavior (~105 and ~177% higher than cases 2 and 3, respectively). Finally, considering the case 1 as reference, the case 3 had the best combined energy saving ($17.64 USD-kWh/year) and case 2 presents a combined energy saving of $7.16 USD-kWh/year. Therefore is highly recommended the use of reflective double pane window, like to case 3, in Mexican warm and cold climates. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","CFD; Double pane window; Thermal performance","Pal, S., Neogi, S., Roy, B., Heat transfer modelling on windows and glazing under the exposure of solar (2009) Energy Build, 41, pp. 654-661. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2009.01.003; Aydin, O., Conjugate heat transfer analysis of double pane windows (2006) Build Environ, 41, pp. 109-116. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.03.015; Xamán, J., Pérez-Nucamendi, C., Arce, J., Hinojosa, J., Álvarez, G., Zavala-Guillén, I., Thermal analysis for a double pane window with a solar control film for using in cold and warm climates (2014) Energy Build, 76, pp. 429-439; Muneer, T., Han, B., Simplified analysis for free convection in enclosures-application to an industrial problem (1996) Energy Convers Manage, 37, pp. 1463-1467. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0196-8904(95)00216-2; Weir, G., Muneer, T., Energy and environmental impact analysis of double-glazed windows (1998) Energy Convers Manage, 39, pp. 243-256. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0196-8904(96)00191-4; Chow, T.-T., Li, C., Lin, Z., The function of solar absorbing window as water-heating device (2011) Build Environ, 46, pp. 955-960. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.10.027; Chow, T.-T., Li, C., Lin, Z., Thermal characteristics of water-flow double-pane window (2011) Int J Therm Sci, 50, pp. 140-148. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2010.10.006; Chow, T.-T., Li, C., Lin, Z., Innovative solar windows for cooling-demand climate (2010) Sol Energy Mater Sol Cells, 94, pp. 212-220; Chaiwiwatworakul, P., Chirarattananon, S., Adouble-pane window with enclosed horizontal slats for daylighting in buildings in the tropics (2013) Energy Build, 62, pp. 27-36. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.02.027; Han, J., Lu, L., Yang, H., Numerical evaluation of the mixed convective heat transfer in a double-pane window integrated with see-through a-Si PV cells with low-e coatings (2010) Appl Energy, 87, pp. 3431-3437. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.05.025; Ismail, K.A.R., Morais Lino, F., Ribeiro da Silva, R.C., Salinas, C.T., Models for thermal efficient double glass window (2014) Eur Int J Sci Technol, 3, pp. 15-32; Lampert, C., Heat mirror coatings for energy conserving windows (1981) Sol Energy Mater Sol Cells, 6, pp. 1-41; Rubin, M., Calculating heat transfer through windows (1982) Energy Res, 6, pp. 341-359; Aydin, O., Determination of optimum air-layer thickness in double-pane windows (2000) Energy Build, 32, pp. 303-308; Ismail, K.A.R., Henríquez, J.R., Two-dimensional model for the double glass naturally ventilated window (2005) Int J Heat Mass Transf, 48, pp. 461-475; Arici Müslüm, K.H., Determination of optimum thickness of double-glazed windows for the climatic regions of Turkey (2010) Energy Build, 42, pp. 1773-1778; Ismail, K.A.R., Salinas, C.T., Henríquez, J.R., Comparison between PCM filled glass windows and absorbing gas filled windows (2008) Energy Build, 40, pp. 710-719. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2007.05.005; Ismail, K.A.R., Salinas, C.T., Henríquez, J.R., Acomparative study of naturally ventilated and gas filled windows for hot climates (2009) Energy Convers Manag, 50, pp. 1691-1703; Gueymard, C., duPont, W., Spectral effects on the transmittance, solar heat gain, and performance rating of glazing systems (2009) Sol Energy, 83, pp. 940-953; Arici Müslüm, K.M., An investigation of flow and conjugate heat transfer in multiple pane windows with respect to gap width, emissivity and gas filling (2015) Renew Energy, 75, pp. 249-256. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.10.004; Tian-Peng, W., Liang-Bi, W., Asteady heat transfer model of hollow double glazing under entire wave length heat radiation (2014) Energy Build, 81, pp. 72-83. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2014.06.014; Modest, M., (1993) Radiative heat transfer, , New York, USA; Patankar, S., (1980) Numerical heat transfer and fluid flow, , Hemisphere, Washington, DC, USA; Raithby, G., Van Doormaal, J., Enhancement of the SIMPLE method for producting incompressible fluid flow (1984) Numer Heat Transf, 7, pp. 147-163; De Vahl Davis, G., Natural convection of air in a square cavity: a Bench Mark numerical solution (1983) Int J Num Meth Fluids, 3, pp. 249-264; Ridouane, E.H., Hasnaoui, M., Amahmid, A., Raji, A., Interact between natural convection and radiation in a square cavity heated from below (2004) Numer Heat Transf Part A, 45, pp. 289-311; ElSherbiny, S.M., Raithby, G.D., Hollands, K.G.T., Heat transfer by natural convection across vertical and inclined air layers (1982) JHeat Transf, 104, pp. 96-102; Glass in building-determination of light transmittance, , solar direct transmittance, total solar energy transmittance, ultraviolet transmittance and related glazing factors-ISO 9050:2003 standard test method",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927935678

However, their fate here is often oversimplified by theoretical models. Biodegradation of PAHs in DSSs, is assumed to be similar to biodegradation in surface habitats, despite high hydrostatic pressures and low temperatures that should significantly limit PAH biodegradation. Bacteria residing in the DSSs (related mainly to α- and γ-Proteobacteria) have been shown to or predicted to possess distinct genes, enzymes and metabolic pathways, indicating an adaptation of these bacterial communities to the psychro-peizophilic conditions of the DSSs. This work summarizes some of the most recent research on DSS hydrocarbonoclastic populations and mechanisms of PAH degradation and discusses the challenges posed by future high CO<inf>2</inf> and UV climate scenarios on biodegradation of PAHs in DSSs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Abyssal sediments; Biodegradation; Climate change; High hydrostatic pressure; Oil pollution; PAHs","Agogué, H., Lamy, D., Neal, P.R., Sogin, M.L., Herndl, G.J., Water mass-specificity of bacterial communities in the North Atlantic revealed by massively parallel sequencing (2011) Mol.

In the literature, there are different methodologies for its modeling, but this study suggests the harmonic analysis application to solar irradiation and sunshine duration data for more refined relevant prediction of solar irradiation. The basis of the methodology is combined application of the HARmonic and the classical LINear regression analyses, and therefore, it is referred to as the HarLin model. It isolates first the periodicity from the daily averages of records and then the linear regression analysis is applied elegantly to first order stationary data. The results are tested and compared with the Adaptive-Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model based on the Sugeno fuzzy logic inference system and Angström-Prescott model in the form of a linear regression analysis. In the application, three solar irradiation sites are considered from different solar energy potential locations in Turkey, namely, at Adana, Gaziantep and Silifke cities. The predictions by the HarLin model appear more successful than ANFIS and the classical Angström-Prescott approaches. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","ANFIS model; Angström-Prescott equation; Harmonic analysis; Solar irradiation; Sunshine duration","Akinoğlu, B.G., Ecevit, A., Construction of a quadratic model using modified Angström coefficients to estimate global solar radiation (1990) Sol Energy, 45, pp. 85-92; Almorox, J., Bocco, M., Willington, E., Estimation of daily global solar radiation from measured temperatures at Cañada de Luque, Córdoba, Argentina (2013) Renew Energy, 60, pp. 382-387; Amato, U., Andretta, A., Banoli, B., Coluzzi, B., Cuomo, V., Fontana, F., Markov processes and Fourier analysis as a tool describe and simulate daily solar irradiance (1986) Sol Energy, 37 (3), pp. 179-194; Angström, A., Solar terrestrial radiation (1924) QJ R Meteorological Soc, 50, pp. 121-126; Baldasano, J.M., Clar, J., Berna, A., Fourier analaysis of daily solar radiation data in Spain (1988) Sol Energy, 41 (4), pp. 327-334; Balling, R., Cerveny, R.S., Spatial and temporal variations in long-term normal percent possible solar radiation levels in the United States (1983) JClim Appl Met, 22, pp. 1726-1732; Benghanem, M., Mellit, A., Alamri, S.N., ANN-based modelling and estimation of daily global solar radiation data: a case study (2009) Energy Convers Manag, 50, pp. 1644-1655; Chen, S.X., Gooi, H.B., Wang, M.Q., Solar radiation forecast based on fuzzy logic and neural networks (2013) Renew Energy, 60, pp. 195-201; Dogniaux, R., Lemoine, M., Classification of radiation sites in terms of different indices of atmospheric transparency (1983) Solar energy data.

Celoria 2, Milan, Italy","Tomato processing involves a significant production of residues, mainly constituted by discarded tomatoes, skins, seeds and pulp. Often, these residues are not valorized and represent an added cost for manufacturing companies because of disposal processes, with environmental issues due to the difficult management. The exploitation of these residual materials results complex as their availability is mainly concentrated in few months. A possible solution is the production of biogas employed in a Combine Heat and Power engine for energy production, in line with the 2020 targets of European Union in terms of promotion of energy from renewable resources and greenhouse gas emission reduction. The tomato by-product utilization for energy production as a strategy to reduce the environmental load of tomato purée was evaluated by means of Life Cycle Assessment. Two scenarios were considered: Baseline Scenario - tomato by-products are sent back to the tomato fields as organic fertilizers; Alternative Scenario - tomato by-products are employed in a nearby biogas plant for energy production. Methane production of tomato by-products was assessed by means of specific laboratory tests. The comparison between the two scenarios highlighted reductions for all the impact categories with the Alternative Scenario. The most important reductions are related to particulate matter (-5.3%), climate change (-6.4%) and ozone depletion (-13.4%). Although small, the reduction of the environmental impact cannot be neglected; for example for climate change, the anaerobic digestion of by-products allows a saving of GHG emissions that, over the whole year, is equal to 1.567tons of CO<inf>2</inf> eq.The results of this study could be up-scaled to the food industries with high heat demand producing considerable amounts of fermentable by-products employable as feedstock for biogas production. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Biogas; Food by-product; Italy; Life Cycle Assessment; Renewable energy; Residues valorization","Alexandratos, N., Bruinsma, J., World agriculture towards 2030/2050: the 2012 revision (2012) ESA Working paper N°. 12-03, , FAO, Rome; Althaus, H.J., Chudacoff, M., Hischier, R., Jungbluth, N., Osses, M., Primas, A., Life cycle inventories of chemicals (2007) Ecoinvent Report No. 8, v2.0 EMPA, , Swiss Centre for Life Cycle Inventories, Dübendorf, Switzerland; Bacenetti, J., Negri, M., Fiala, M., González-García, S., Anaerobic digestion of different feedstock: impact on energetic and environmental balances of biogas process (2013) Sci.

Among the available tools, partial equilibrium models are particularly suited to represent and analyze complex energy systems with a high technology detail as well as to individuate the optimal energy-technology roadmaps that allows to fulfil multiple objectives (e.g. energy supply security, climate change mitigation and air quality improvement). In fact these models enable the users to perform a scenario analysis in order to explore the behaviour of energy system to boundary conditions variations. They are typically characterized by a huge amount of data which informative content is often not fully exploited. In this framework, multivariate statistical techniques (Cluster Analysis - CA and Principal Component Analysis - PCA) can represent a key tool to characterize data correlation structure and to point out the variables with the highest information content. The paper shows the methodological procedure utilized to characterize the NEEDS-TIMES Pan European model results, describing its usefulness to individuate homogeneous areas for the application of suited targets and to characterize from a statistical point of view energy systems behaviour in different scenario hypothesis. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy models; Multivariate statistical analysis; Synthetic index","Kypreos, S., Blesl, M., Cosmi, C., Kanudia, A., Loulou, R., Smekens, K., Salvia, M., Cuomo, V., TIMES-EU: A Pan European model integrating LCA and external costs (2008) Int J Sustainable Dev Plann, 3 (2), pp. 1-15; Blesl, M., Kober, T., Bruchof, D., Kuder, R., Effects of climate and energy policy related measures and targets on the future structure of the European energy system in 2020 and beyond (2010) Energy Policy, 38 (10), pp. 6278-6292. , Published: OCT 2010Effects; Ragosta, M., Telesca, V., D'Ottavio, A., Scavone, G., (2013) Multivariate Synthetic Indexes for Evaluating Local Climatic Changes, , Tsinghua University Press Beijing Proceedings of 35th IAHR World Congress ©; Loulou, R., Goldstein, G., Noble, K., (2005) Documentation for the MARKAL Family of Models, , http://www.iea-etsap.org/web/MrklDoc-I_StdMARKAL.pdf, ETSAP; Loulou, R., Remme, U., Kanudia, A., Lehtila, A., Goldstein, G., (2005) Documentation for the TIMES Model - PART i, pp. 1-78. , http://www.iea-etsap.org/web/Docs/TIMESDoc-Intro.pdf; VEDA-FE User Guide - Version 1.5.11, , http://www.kanors.com/userguidefe.htm, KanORS Consulting Inc; VEDA4 User Guide - Version 4.3.8, , http://www.kanors.com/userguidebe.htm, KanORS Consulting Inc; (2012) GAMS - The General Algebraic Modeling System, , http://www.gams.com/; Cosmi, C., Blesl, M., Kanudia, A., Kypreos, S., Loulou, R., Salvia, M., Smekens, K., Cuomo, V., Integration of country energy system models in a Pan European framework for supporting EU policies (2006) Environmental Economics and Investment Assessment.

The premise of this approach is that the mainstreaming of the climate mitigation issue within the local level polices will result in various local environmental and non-environmental co-benefits in addition to a reduction of GHG emissions. The implementation of the co-benefits approach aims to strengthen the policy making process, which is identified as being especially important in context of developing cities. This paper attempts to confirm this by analyzing a planning process of and global and local benefits generated by an innovative project related to provision of bicycle parking. The paper firstly overviews recent co-benefits literature related to urban transport in general and active travel in particular, as well as evaluated benefits related to bicycle infrastructure provision. Then, taking the case of the Serbian city of Novi Sad, this paper examines local drivers behind the bicycle project implementation, the reduction of CO<inf>2</inf> emission generated by the increase of cycle commuters, the project impact on individual commute behavior as well as potential for income generation. The results support arguments towards relevance of implementation of the co-benefits approach within processes of cycling planning and popularization, particularly highlighting the role and possibilities for implementation of co-benefits projects related to bicycle parking facilities. This case study is relevant as it identifies and analyses a real-life action to respond to both, global and local sustainability challenges, but also, as it points to an action at the city level that has potential for diffusing desirable changes into wider society. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.","Bicycling; Co-benefits; CO<inf>2</inf> emission; Developing cities","Harloe, M., Cities in the transition (1996) Cities after Socialism: Urban and Regional Change and Conflict in Post-socialist Societies, pp. 1-29. , G.

Not only has the discussion focused on the causes of this issue, but many recommendations for enhancing the use of information and knowledge have also been made. The authors first frame the knowledge challenges and, second, introduce a systematic means to identify the factors hindering the use of information and knowledge. The approach proposed allows determining core barriers in the co-production, exchange, and use of knowledge. Subsequently, we illustrate where further advancement is needed in the field of knowledge development, means of transmission and use for disaster risk reduction. We suggest a method that analyses cases considering the success or failure of information flows from and to different stakeholder groups. The aim is to identify causes for knowledge fragmentation at different phases in the disaster management continuum, and, subsequently, to strengthen both individual and institutional learning, as well as to determine social and functional changes required to address pressing issues of disaster risk reduction, including climate change adaptation, in a competent manner. © 2015 The Authors.","Climate change adaptation; Disaster risk reduction; Knowledge; Science communication; Science-policy nexus","White, G.F., Kates, R.W., Burton, I., Knowing better and losing even more: the use of knowledge in hazard management (2001) Glob.

Climate change projections highlight positive feedbacks between invasive species spread and increased bushfire risk. We use empirical evidence of current practices of invasive plant management, and the case of Gamba grass (Andropogon gayanus), to illustrate what it means to live with invasive plants. Gamba is a significant threat to tropical savanna biodiversity through its influence on fire regimes across northern Australia. We analyse the practices of Gamba governance via policy analysis, interviews with over 50 managers and participant observation. Our results show the multiple ways in which Gamba exceeds and escapes governance, exposing the impossibility and risks of absolute control as a management framing. By attending to practice in this way, we show how an alternative framing, in which living with weeds is a more explicit part of the governance framework, can work. Our framing contributes to more effective management because political choices are made more transparent, valorises pragmatic knowledge about the messy reality of living with weeds, and mobilises a broader range of resources including land managers now resistant to the state. The Gamba-fire assemblage has mobilised political action by invoking fire policy rather than weed policy, but not necessarily in a way consistent with best practice weed management. Attention to these practices of vernacular governance not only shows the ideal of present control to be illusory, but will also provide important cultural resources in the form of networks and capacity, as the challenges of invasive species shift and intensify. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Andropogon gayanus; Climate change; Environmental governance; Qualitative methods; Savanna land use; Weeds","Abatzoglou, J.T., Kolden, C.A., Climate change in western US deserts: potential for increased wildfire and invasive annual grasses (2011) Rangel.

There is currently no simple method available to estimate vegetation cover at the broad scale (above the level of individual vegetation-type mapping or modelling) that does not rely, at least in part, on remote sensing data. This means that for periods where this data is unavailable (pre 1980 and future forecasting) estimates of vegetation cover are also unavailable. De Martonne's simple Aridity Index (AI) requires only rainfall and temperature data however it is not widely applicable and regularly fails in arid and semi-arid regions. The Climate Aridity Vegetation Index (CAVI) has been developed in an attempt to overcome this limitation while retaining simplicity in the data required and in the calculation. The CAVI is based on readily available rainfall and temperature data and has been applied and tested across 12 years of monthly data across Australia. The CAVI estimates have then been validated by comparing them to the corresponding fractional cover satellite data. Performance is discussed in the context of using vegetation cover estimates in wind erosion research. The results were particularly encouraging in arid to semi-arid regions and can potentially be used as a surrogate for historical broad scale vegetation cover and possibly future projections. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Arid and semi-arid; Climate variability; Modelling; Rainfall; Temperature; Vegetation cover","Arthur, C., (2009) Outback Seagulls a Long Way from Home, , http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-05-28/outback-seagulls-a-long-way-from-home/1696710, viewed 12/05/2014; (2014) ENSO Wrap-up, , http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/index.shtml, viewed 8/04/2014; Chappell, A., Improving the spatio-temporal erodibility of dust emission models using MODIS data (2013) Proceedings of the AGU Fall Meeting San Francisco; De Martonne, E., Aréisme et indice artidite (1926) Comptes Rendus L'Acad Sci, 182, pp. 1395-1398; (2006) Arid and Semi Arid Zones, , http://www.cazr.csiro.au/connect/resources.htm, viewed 1/05/2014; Donohue, R.J., McVicar, T.R., Roderick, M.L., Climate-related trends in Australian vegetation cover as inferred from satellite observations, 1981-2006 (2009) Glob.

In the present study, the ECO Lab tool embedded in the Mike Hydro Basin software was used for the evaluation of river water quality, in particular the dissolved concentration of phosphorus in the period 1990-2013. The phosphorus concentrations are influenced by the burned area and the river flow discharge, but the hydrologic conditions prevail: in a wet year (2000, 16.3km2 of burned area) with an average flow of 16.4m3·s-1 the maximum phosphorus concentration was as low as 0.02mg·L-1, while in a dry year (2005, 24.4km2 of burned area) with an average flow of 2m3·s-1 the maximum concentration was as high as 0.57mg·L-1. Phosphorus concentrations in the water bodies exceeded the bounds of good ecological status in 2005 and between 2009 and 2012, water for human consumption in 2009 and water for multiple uses in 2010. The River Covas, a right margin tributary of Beça River, is the most appropriate stream as regards the use of water for human consumption, because it presents the biggest water potential with the best water quality. Since wildfires in the basin result essentially from natural causes and climate change forecasts indicate an increase in their frequency and intensity in the near future, forestry measures are proposed to include as a priority the conversion of stands of maritime pine in mixed stands of conifer and hardwood species. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Fire risk; Hydrology; Land use; Mike Hydro Basin; Phosphorus; Wildfire","Baird, M., Zabowski, D., Everett, R.L., Wildfire effects on carbon and nitrogen in inland coniferous forests (1999) Plant Soil, 209, pp. 233-243; Bangash, R.F., Passuello, A., Hammond, M., Schuhmacher, M., Water allocation assessment in low flow river under data scarce conditions: a study of hydrological simulation in Mediterranean basin (2012) Sci.

Therefore, the wind and wave climates are subjected to a correlation of wind and wave parameters for design purposes. These correlations are often based on a lumping of the directional wave climate and subsequent association of the lumped wave climate to the directional wind climate. Preservation of the hydrodynamic fatigue distribution from the full wave climate is an important aspect in the wind-wave correlation process which requires an adequate consideration of the dynamics from the offshore wind turbine. However, only a few wind-wave correlation methods exist for the fatigue design of offshore wind turbines and none of them take the dynamics of the full structure adequately into account. In this study a new wind-wave correlation method has been developed and introduced. The new method is based on the establishment of damage contour lines which are used to determine the sea-state parameters that ensure simultaneous compliance with damage equivalency criterions at different locations within the offshore wind turbine. This simultaneous damage equivalency throughout the structure together with the straightforward derivation of the corresponding damage equivalent sea-state parameters constitutes the novelty of the presented wind-wave correlation method. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Damage contour lines; Fatigue design; Offshore wind turbines; Wave lumping; Wind-wave correlation","Barltrop, N., Adams, A., (1991) Dynamics of fixed offshore structures, , Butterworth Heinemann; Bredmose, H., Larsen, S.E., Matha, D., Rettenmeier, A., Marino, E., Eichstaedt, R., (2012) D2.04: Collation of offshore wind wave dynamics,"" in Marine Renewables Infrastructure Network, , http://orbit.dtu.dk/ws/files/60086212/Collation_of_offshore.pdf, Available at, [accessed 16.01.15]; Burton, T., Jenkins, T., Sharpe, D., Bossanyi, E., (2011) Wind energy handbook, , John Wiley & Sons; (2014) Design of offshore wind turbine structures, , Offshore Standard.

The reduction of the total volume of greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere is considered a key mechanism to mitigate climate change. Geological storage of CO<inf>2</inf> in deep saline aquifers is currently a well-accepted method of storage, because saline aquifers have larger storage capacities than other geological media. Rock-water-CO<inf>2</inf> interactions initiated in the aquifer with CO<inf>2</inf> injection play a vital role in CO<inf>2</inf> sequestration in saline aquifers, and include different trapping mechanisms: geological trapping, hydrodynamic trapping and geo-chemical trapping (solubility trapping and mineral trapping). Of these, geological trapping and solubility trapping are more effective in the short term, but mineral trapping is safer and more economical in the long term. Current knowledge of geochemical trapping is still at an early stage compared to other trapping mechanisms due to the extensive time required to complete the process. To date, very few studies have been conducted on sandstone reservoirs, which are considered to have the largest storage capacity among geological formations. However, due to the long-term safety of CO<inf>2</inf> storage with geochemical trapping, there has been a recent trend to research this process. Both solubility and mineral trapping processes in saline aquifers depend on injecting CO<inf>2</inf> and the fluid-rock mineral properties of the aquifers. Until very recently, although it was assumed that temperature, pressure, the salinity of the formation water and the mineral composition of the formation rock are the only parameters which affect mineral trapping, recent research has shown that a number of other reservoir parameters, such as layer thickness, tilt angle, anisotropy and bedding pattern may also significantly affect geochemical trapping. This review provides a comprehensive examination of the current knowledge of the geo-chemistry of solubility and mineral trapping processes in deep saline aquifers. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","CO<inf>2</inf> geo-sequestration; Geo-chemistry; Mineral trapping; Saline aquifers; Sandstone; Solubility trapping","(2013) Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis, Contribution of Working Group i to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, p. 1535. , IPCC, Stocker TF, Qin D, Plattner G-K, Tignor M, Allen SK, Boschung J, Nauels A, Xia Y, Bex V, Midgley PM (editors), Cambridge United Kingdom and New York, USA: Cambridge University Press; Preston, B.L., Jones, R.N., (2006) Climate Change Impacts on Australia and the Benefits of Early Action to Reduce Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions, , CSIRO Australia; Hulme, M., Lu, X., Turnpenny, J., Mitchell, T., Jenkins, G., Jones, R., (2002) Climate Change Scenarios for the United Kingdom: The UKCIP02 Scientific Report, Norwich: Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia; (2007) IPCC Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis - Summary for Policy Makers, , Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Secretariat; Howard, H., Baldur, E., Olav, K., Capturing greenhouse gases (2000) Sci Am; Bachu, S., Adams, J., Sequestration of CO<inf>2</inf> in geological media in response to climate change: Capacity of deep saline aquifers to sequester CO<inf>2</inf> in solution (2003) Energy Convers Manage, 44, pp. 3151-3175; Baines, S.J., Worden, R.H., (2004) Geological Storage of Carbon Dioxide, 233, pp. 1-6. , Geological Society of London, Special Publication; Herzog, H., Eliasson, B., Kaastard, O., Capturing green house gases (2000) Sci Am, 282, pp. 72-79; Freund, P., Omerod, W.G., Progress toward storage of carbon dioxide (1997) Energy Convers Manage, 38, pp. S199-S204; Orr, J.C., Aumont, A., Yool, K., Plattner, G.K., Joos, F., Weirig, M.F., Ocean CO<inf>2</inf> sequestration efficiency from 3-D ocean model comparison (2001) GHGT-5, Green House Gas Control Technologies, Australia: CSIRO, pp. 479-484; Adams, E.E., Caldeira, K., Ocean storage of CO<inf>2</inf> (2008) Elements, 4, pp. 319-324; Drange, H., Alendal, G., Johannessen, O.M., Ocean release of fossil fuel CO<inf>2</inf>: A case study (2001) Geophys Res Lett, 28, pp. 2637-2640; Sabine, C.L., Tanhua, T., Estimation of anthropogenic CO<inf>2</inf> inventories in the ocean (2010) Annu Rev Mar Sci, 2, pp. 175-198; Gale, J., Geological storage of CO<inf>2</inf>: What do we know, where are the gaps and what more needs to be done?

In the context of the scientific and policy debate surrounding potential climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, the importance of the impact of relatively recent state fire-exclusion policies on fire regimes has been debated. To provide empirical evidence to this ongoing debate we examine the impacts of state fire-exclusion policies in the chestnut forest ecosystems of two geographically neighbouring municipalities in central Spain, Casillas and Rozas de Puerto Real. Extending the concept of 'Traditional Ecological Knowledge' to include the use of fire as a management tool as 'Traditional Fire Knowledge' (TFK), we take a mixed-methods and interdisciplinary approach to argue that currently observed differences between the municipalities are useful for considering the characteristics of ""pre-industrial anthropogenic fire regimes"" and their impact on chestnut forest ecosystems. We do this by examining how responses from interviews and questionnaire surveys of local inhabitants about TFK in the past and present correspond to the current biophysical landscape state and recent fire activity (based on data from dendrochronological analysis, aerial photography and official fire statistics). We then discuss the broader implications of TFK decline for future fire management policies across Europe particularly in light of the published results of the EU sponsored Fire Paradox research project. In locations where TFK-based ""pre-industrial anthropogenic fire regimes"" still exist, ecosystem management strategies for adaptation and mitigation to climate change could be conceivably implemented at a minimal economic and political cost to the state by local communities that have both the TFK and the adequate social, economic and cultural incentives to use it. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Chestnut forest ecosystems; Fire exclusion policies; Fire paradox; Traditional ecological knowledge; Traditional fire knowledge","Abbot, I., Burrows, N., Aboriginal fire regimes in south-west Western Australia: evidence from historical documents (2003) Symposium Proceedings, 1. , Backhuys Publishers, Australia; Agrawal, A., Chhatre, A., Hardin, R., Changing governance of the world's forests (2008) Science, 320 (5882), pp. 1460-1462; Altangerel, K., Kull, C., The prescribed burning debate in Australia: conflicts and compatibilities (2013) J.

This paper presents the offshore wind resource map of the Gulf of Thailand, with the objective of identifying the potential areas for grid connected offshore wind power development. A coupled numerical mesoscale atmospheric model and a microscale wind flow model, along with long-term global reanalysis climate data, are used to generate high resolution (200m) wind resource maps at heights of 40m, 80m, 100m, and 120m above sea level. The offshore wind resource maps are validated using measured wind speeds obtained from 28 meteorological towers installed along the coast of the Gulf of Thailand. The site selection of potential areas for offshore wind power development is assessed with a multi-criteria decision making analysis.

We study the impact of finite surface dust availability on the dust cycle in the MarsWRF General Circulation Model (GCM), which uses radiatively active dust with parameterized 'dust devil' and wind stress dust lifting to enable the spontaneous production of dust storms, and tracks budgets of dust lifting, deposition, and total surface dust inventory. We seek a self-consistent, long-term 'steady state' dust cycle for present day Mars, consisting of (a) a surface dust distribution that varies from year to year but is constant longer-term and in balance with current dust redistribution processes, and (b) a fixed set of dust lifting parameters that continue to produce major storms for this distribution of surface dust. We relax the GCM's surface dust inventory toward this steady state using an iterative process, in which dust lifting rate parameters are increased as progressively more surface sites are exhausted of dust. Late in the equilibration process, the GCM exhibits quasi-steady state behavior in which few new surface grid points are exhausted during a 60. year period with constant dust lifting parameters. Complex regional-scale dust redistribution occurs on time-scales from less than seasonal to decadal, and the GCM generates regional to global dust storms with many realistic features. These include merging regional storms, cross-equatorial storms, and the timing and location of several storm types, though very early major storms and large amounts of late storm activity are not reproduced. Surface dust availability in key onset and growth source regions appears vital for 'early' major storms, with replenishment of these regions required before another large storm can occur, whereas 'late' major storms appear primarily dependent on atmospheric variability. For the parameter space explored, no simulation achieves a steady state with continuing major storms lasting longer than 60. years when a constant wind stress lifting threshold is used. However, such a long-term steady state is achieved when a variable threshold is introduced, in which the threshold increases as dust is removed. This negative feedback on lifting slows it sufficiently for a balance to be produced between dust removal and re-deposition, even in key source regions for major storms. One concern is that the long-term surface dust distributions produced in these simulations show significant differences to the observed northern hemisphere albedo map, in particular predicting Tharsis and NE Arabia to be relatively dust-free. Although some observed high albedo regions may not have significant mobile dust, others likely have a dust cover several meters thick. The mismatches may reflect deficiencies in the GCM or the iterative process used, or the existence of ancient deep dust deposits formed during a past climate epoch. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..","Atmospheres, dynamics; Mars; Mars, atmosphere; Mars, climate; Mars, surface","Ayoub, F., Threshold for sand mobility on Mars calibrated from seasonal variations of sand flux (2014) Nat.

To analyze the applicability of the developed system, this study selected 'U' University, a complex building project consisting of research facility and residential facility. Through value engineering with experts, a total of 137 design alternatives were established. Based on these alternatives, the macroscopic analysis results were as follows: (i) at the program-level, the life-cycle environmental and economic cost in 'U' University were reduced by 6.22% and 2.11%, respectively; (ii) at the project-level, the life-cycle environmental and economic cost in research facility were reduced 6.01% and 1.87%, respectively; and those in residential facility, 12.01% and 3.83%, respective; and (iii) for the mechanical work at the work-type-level, the initial cost was increased 2.9%; but the operation and maintenance phase was reduced by 20.0%. As a result, the developed system can allow the facility managers to establish the operation and maintenance strategies for the environmental and economic aspects from a program-level perspective. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Complex building; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle cost; Program management","Albino, V., Balice, A., Dangelico, R.M., Environmental strategies and green product development: an overview on sustainability-driven companies (2009) Bus.

Such natural disasters have caused damage to some bridges, consequently isolating residential communities located on mountains, and hampering the ability to delivery emergency relief supplies to those communities. In order to provide quick emergency relief, the simple construction of a temporary bridge becomes critical for the transportation of food and medical supplies into the emergency disaster areas. While composite materials for footbridges and vehicular traffic applications have been widely used overseas, they are not suitable for disaster relief applications. The objective of this paper is to present a novel bridge structure for a portable, reusable, and lightweight bridge. This paper focuses on the design concept and experimental verification of a temporary composite bridge for disaster relief. Ultimately, it advocates composite bridges for disaster relief applications. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cable-stayed composite bridge; Composite emergency bridge; Lightweight, portable and reusable bridge","Cheng, L., Karbhari, V.M., New bridge systems using FRP composites and concrete: a state-of-the-art review, readers write (2006) Prog Struct Eng Mater, 8 (4), pp. 143-154; Hollaway, L.C., The evolution of and the way forward for advanced polymer composite in the civil infrastructure (2001) Proceedings of the international conference on FRP composites in civil engineering, pp. 27-40. , Elsevier Science Ltd, Hong Kong; Seible, F., Sun, Z., Ma, G., Glass fiber composite bridges in China (1993), ACTT-93/01, University of California, San DiegoArio, I., Development of a prototype deployable bridge based on origami skill (2013) Autom Constr, 32, pp. 104-111; Lederman, G., A novel deployable tied arch bridge (2014) Eng Struct, 70, pp. 1-10; Teixeira, A.M.A.J., Structural evaluation of a GFRP truss girder for a deployable bridge (2014) Compos Struct, 110, pp. 29-38; (2004) FRP Bridge-Technologies and Prospects, , Japan Society of Civil Engineers, [in Japanese]; Sedlacek, G., Trumpf, H., Mobile light-weight fixed bridges out of pultruded fiber-reinforced polymer profiles (2002) Sci Eng Compos Mater, 10 (6), pp. 383-395; Erki, M.A., Shyu, C.R., Wight, R.G., Multiple bolted connections in pultruded FRP composites (2005), In: Proceedings, Annual conference-Canadian society for civil engineering, GC-218-1-7Nguyen, D.H., Hiroshi, M., Behavior of bolted/bonded joints in pultruded hybrid CFRP/GFRP composites (2010) J Struct Eng, 56 A, pp. 23-31; Specification for structural steel buildings: allowable stress design.

Shoreline locations for Wave Energy Converters (WECs) offer lower wave energy densities when compared with offshore locations, but give significant advantages from the points of view of construction, maintenance and grid connection.This article provides a first analysis on the viability of a very low-head hydropower plant, in which waves accumulate water into a shoreline reservoir created by a steep detached ramp. The system is particularly suitable for micro-tidal environments such as the Mediterranean Sea and has the additional advantage of protecting shorelines, seawalls and coastal assets from wave action.Physical model tests, conducted with regular waves, have been used to get a preliminary estimate of the average water flux overtopping the ramp in a sea state; a novel low-head hydropower machine, developed at Southampton University, has been considered for the conversion of the hydraulic energy into electricity.The site of Porto Alabe, located along the West coast of Sardinia (Italy), has been chosen as a first case study. Based on the inshore wave climate, the layout of the ramp has been designed as a tradeoff between the needs of maximizing the energy production, providing the coastal area with an adequate protection and making the plant a desirable investment to either private or public players. The results are interesting both from a technical and an economic point of views and encourage a further deepening on the response of this kind of WEC. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Composite seawall; Low-head hydropower; Shoreline wave energy converter; Wave energy","Waters, R., Engstrom, J., Isberg, J., Leijon, M., Wave climate off the Swedish west coast (2009) Renew Energy, 34 (6). , 1600e6; Thorpe, T.W., The wave energy programme in the UK and the European wave energy Network (2000) Fourth European wave energy conference, Aalborg (Denmark), , AEA Technology, Oxfordshire, UK; Iglesias, G., Carballo, R., Wave energy resource in the Estaca de Bares area (Spain) (2010) Renew Energy, 35 (7). , 1574e84; Guedes Soares, C., Rute Bento, A., Goncalves, M., Silva, D., Martinho, P., Numerical Evaluation of the wave energy resource along the Atlantic European coast (2014) Comput Geosciences, 71, pp. 37-49; Clément, A., McCullen, P., Falcao, A., Fiorentino, A., Gardner, F., Hammarlund, K., Wave energy in Europe: current status and perspectives (2002) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 6 (5). , 405e31; Azzellino, A., Conley, D., Vicinanza, D., Kofoed, J.P., Marine renewable energies: perspectives and implications for marine ecosystems (2013) Special Issue Sci World J, 2013; Azzellino, A., Ferrante, V., Kofoed, J.P., Lanfredi, C., Vicinanza, D., Optimal siting of offshore wind-power combined with wave energy through a marine spatial planning approach (2013) Int J Mar Energy, pp. 11-25; Carballo, R., Iglesias, G., Wave farm impact based on realistic wave-WEC interaction (2013) Energy, pp. 216-229; Fernandez, H., Iglesias, G., Carballo, R., Castro, A., Fraguela, J.A., Taveira-Pinto, F., The new wave energy converter WaveCat: concept and laboratory tests (2012) Mar Struct, 29 (1), pp. 58-70; Kofoed, J.P., Frigaard, P., Friis-Madsen, E., Sørensen, H.C., Prototype testing of the wave energy converter wave dragon (2006) Renew Energy, 31 (2), pp. 181-189; Törnqvist, N.A., Theoretical analyses of some simple wave power devices (1978) Int J Energy Res, 2 (3), pp. 281-294; Falcão, A.F.O., Henriques, J.C.C., Cândido, J.J., Dynamics and optimization of the OWC spar buoy wave energy converter (2012) Renew Energy, 48, pp. 369-381; Folley, M., Whittaker, T.J.T., Analysis of the nearshore wave energy resource (2009) Renew Energy, 34, pp. 1709-1715; Torre-Enciso, Y., Ortubia, I., Lopez de Aguileta, L.I., Marques, J., Mutriku Wave Power Plant: from the thinking out to the reality (2009) EWTEC 2009 proceedings of the 8th European wave and tidal energy conference, , [Uppsala, Sweden]; Falcao, A.F.O., First-generation wave power plants: current status and R&D requirements (2004) JOffshore Mech Arct Eng, 126, p. 384; Buccino, M., Vicinanza, D., Salerno, D., Banfi, D., Calabrese, M., Nature and Magnitude of wave loadings at Seawave Slot-cone Generators (2015) Ocean Eng, 95, pp. 34-58; Buccino, M., Banfi, D., Vicinanza, D., Calabrese, M., Del Giudice, G., Carravetta, A., Non breaking wave forces at the front face of Seawave Slotcone Generators (2012) Energies, 2012 (5), pp. 4779-4803; Silva, D., Rusu, E., Guedes Soares, A., Evaluation of various technologies for wave energy conversion in the Portuguese nearshore (2013) Energies, 2013 (6), pp. 1344-1364; Vicinanza, D., Contestabile, P., Nørgaard, J., Lykke Andersen, T., Innovative rubble mound breakwaters for overtopping wave energy conversion (2014) Coast Eng, 88, pp. 154-170; Geeraert, J., De Rouck, J., Reduction of wave overtopping at seadikes: stilling wave basin - 3D research (2008) Proc ICCE 2008, 4, pp. 3157-3163; Mori, M., Yamamoto, Y., Kimura, K., Wave force and stability of upright section of high mound composite seawall (2008) Proc ICCE 2008, 4, pp. 3164-3172; Victor, L., Troch, P., Wave overtopping at smooth impermeable steep slopes with low crest freeboards (2012) JWaterw Port Coast Ocean Eng, 138, pp. 372-385; Kamphuis, J.W., Incipient wave breaking (1991) Coast Eng, 15, pp. 185-203; Zanuttigh, B., van der Meer, J.W., Wave reflection from coastal structures in design conditions (2008) Coast Eng, 55, pp. 771-779; Adams, C.B., Sonu, C.J., Wave transmission across submerged near surface breakwaters (1987) Proc Int Conf Coast Eng, pp. 1729-1738; Le Méhauté, B., (1976) An introduction to hydrodynamics and water waves, , Springer, New York; Kortenhaus, A., van der Meer, J.W., Burcharth, H.F., Geeraerts, J., van Gent, M., Pullen, T., (2004) Final Report on scale effects.

In order to assess simultaneously the phylogeny and functionality, we applied phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFAs), metaproteomics and enzyme activities in soil samples from a natural area located in Southeast Spain (Caravaca de la Cruz), dominated by Pinus halepensis (F), and an adjacent area deforested 15-years ago (DF). Deforestation induced a long-term loss of bacterial biomass and enzyme activity, but an increase in the bacterial diversity as estimated by metaproteomics. Protein abundances analysis revealed that Proteobacteria was higher in F than DF. In addition, the abundance of cyanobacterial proteins was significantly higher in DF (7.3%) when compared to F (0.9%). Interestingly, cyanobacterial proteins involved in carbon fixation (Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, phycocyanins and photosystem proteins) were only identified in DF. The data suggest that Cyanobacteria play a critical role in the ecosystem functioning and biotic carbon fixation when soil is deforested in semiarid areas. © 2015 .","Biomass; Deforestation; Metaproteomics; Microbial community","Bastida, F., Moreno, J.L., Hernández, T., García, C., Microbiological degradation index of soils in a semiarid climate (2006) Soil Biol.

Green roofs may bring several benefits to urban areas including flood mitigation. However, empirical evidence from full-scale roofs, especially those that have been operational for more than several years is limited. This study investigates the hydrologic performance of a full-scale extensive green roof in Leeds, UK. Monitoring of the green roof took place over a 20 month period (between 30th June 2012 and 9th February 2014). The results indicate that the green roof can effectively retain and detain rainfall from the precipitation events included in the analysis. Retention was found to correspond significantly with rainfall depth, duration, intensity and prior dry weather period. Significant differences in retention values between the summer and winter seasons were also noted. Regression analysis failed to provide an accurate model to predict green roof retention as demonstrated by a validation exercise. Further monitoring of the green roof may reveal stronger relationships between rainfall characteristics and green roof retention. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Green roof; Retention; Storm water management; Urban drainage; Urbanisation","Barrio, E.P.D., Analysis of the green roofs cooling potential in buildings (1998) Energy Build., 27, pp. 179-193; Bates, A.J., SWITCH in Birmingham, UK: experimental investigation of the ecological and hydrological performance of extensive green roofs (2009) Rev.

Given the importance of road verges as potential corridors and refuge for biodiversity, natural plant regeneration processes may also play an important role in establishing vegetation into these novel landscape elements. Most studies on woody colonization of roadsides have considered only a few sites covering a very limited environmental range. Therefore, it is unclear whether or not there are general patterns that may explain the development of woody vegetation. We analyzed woody vegetation colonization in embankments over a large and heterogeneous territory, using aerial photographs, available repositories of environmental and land management data sets and some embankment features. We addressed the following questions: (1) To what extent does the presence of planted woody plants influence patterns of natural recruitment in road embankments? and (2) What are the key factors underlying natural/passive plant colonization in road embankments? We used Multi-Model Inference (MMI) analysis to model woody vegetation cover. According to our results, woody-planted vegetation does not have a facilitating effect on natural colonization, questioning the efficiency of reforestation measures in the ecological integration of areas affected by road construction. Passive natural plant colonization occurs spontaneously in road verges and shows a highly site-dependent pattern, driven mainly by the age of embankments and the immediate surrounding vegetation. Therefore, we suggest that natural succession may be sufficiently effective as a passive restoration measure on embankments in the long term. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Mediterranean climate; Multi-Model Inference; Passive restoration; Plantations; Secondary succession","Andrés, P., Jorba, M., Mitigation strategies in some motorway embankments (Catalonia, Spain) (2000) Restoration Ecology, 8 (3), pp. 268-275; Badía, D., Valero, R., Gracia, A., Martí, C., Molina, F., Ten-year growth of woody species planted in reclaimed mined banks with different slopes (2007) Arid Land Research and Management, 21 (1), pp. 67-79; Balaguer, L., Escudero, A., Martín-Duque, J.F., Mola, I., Aronson, J., The historical reference in restoration ecology: Re-defining a cornerstone concept (2014) Biological Conservation, 176, pp. 12-20; Bini, L.M., Diniz-Filho, J.A.F., Rangel, T.F.L.V.B., Akre, T.S.B., Albaladejo, R.G., Albuquerque, F.S., Coefficient shifts in geographical ecology: An empirical evaluation of spatial and non-spatial regression (2009) Ecography, 32 (2), pp. 193-204; Bochet, E., García-Fayos, P., Factors controlling vegetation establishment and water erosion on motorway slopes in Valencia, Spain (2004) Restoration Ecology, 12 (2), pp. 166-174; Bochet, E., García-Fayos, P., Alborch, B., Tormo, J., Soil water availability effects on seed germination account for species segregation in semiarid roadslopes (2007) Plant and Soil, 295 (1-2), pp. 179-191; Bochet, E., García-Fayos, P., Tormo, J., Road slope revegetation in semiarid Mediterranean environments.

In response, concentrations of suspended sediments and a range of trace organic pollutants were intensively measured in dry weather and storm flow runoff from a 100% urban watershed. Flow in this highly urban watershed responded very quickly to rainfall and varied widely resulting in rapid changes of turbidity, suspended sediments and pollutant concentrations. Concentrations of each organic pollutant class were within similar ranges reported in other studies of urban runoff, however comparison was limited for several of the pollutants given information scarcity. Consistently among PCBs, PBDEs, and PAHs, the more hydrophobic congeners were transported in larger proportions during storm flows relative to low flows. Loads for Water Years 2007-2010 were estimated using regression with turbidity during the monitored months and a flow weighted mean concentration for unmonitored dry season months. More than 91% of the loads for every pollutant measured were transported during storm events, along with 87% of the total discharge. While this dataset fills an important local data gap for highly urban watersheds of San Francisco Bay, the methods, the uniqueness of the analyte list, and the resulting interpretations have applicability for managing pollutant loads in urban watersheds in other parts of the world. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Arid climate; Management implications; Organic pollutants; Stormwater runoff; Urban land use","Brander, S.M., Fojut, T.L., Palumbo, A.J., Tjeerdema, R.S., Water quality criteria report for bifenthrin.

The purpose of this study was to determine the WF for rice production (WF<inf>R</inf>) in two rice-growing areas in Argentina: central-east Entre Ríos and Santa Fe. The calculation was made using the methodology proposed in The Water Footprint Assessment Manual, according to which the WF of a crop, in this case rice, represents the relation between the amount of water satisfying the evapotranspiration demand (CWU) and the field productivity. The WF has three components: green (WFgreen), associated with rain used by the crop (CWUgreen); blue (WFblue), related to underground or surface water that fulfils the evapotranspiration demand (CWUblue); and grey (WFgrey), related to the volume of water required to dilute the residues of pollutants generated from the crop production. To estimate the CWUblue and CWUgreen, a rice water balance model (RWM), specifically developed for continuous flooding irrigation, was applied. Based on daily data of precipitation, crop evapotranspiration and soil variables the model allows calculating gross irrigation depth, surface runoff due to precipitations, variation of water stored in the soil, and deep percolation. Four agricultural seasons were assessed: 2009/2010, 2010/2011, 2011/2012, and 2012/2013. In Entre Ríos, WF was 987 m3 ton-1 (44% WFgreen and 56% WFblue), whereas in Santa Fe it was 846 m3 ton-1 (36% WFgreen and 64% WFblue). In accordance with related work in the region, WFgrey was not considered. Although only CWU is part of the WF calculation, the other components of the water balance are necessary for rice production. The RWM model determined the consumptive use of the crop and distinguished blue water from green water, besides calculating the other parameters of the water balance. This made possible to show the inefficiencies in the system since precipitations are not fully used. The WF<inf>R</inf>, together with these components, is useful to make comparisons between different regions and it is a tool to promote water saving, provided that it is complemented with specific policies, such as the differential application of irrigation taxes or electric power rates. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The resulting stiff system of partial differential equations for ice velocity is either solved implicitly at great computational cost, or explicitly with added pseudo-elasticity (elastic-viscous-plastic, EVP). A recent modification of the EVP approach seeks to improve the convergence of the EVP method by re-interpreting it as a pseudotime VP solver. The question of convergence of this modified EVP method is revisited here and it is shown that convergence is reached provided the stability requirements are satisfied and the number of pseudotime iterations is sufficiently high. Only in this limit, the VP and the modified EVP solvers converge to the same solution. Related questions of the impact of mesh resolution and incomplete convergence are also addressed. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Elastic-viscous-plastic rheology; FESOM; Sea ice; Viscous-plastic rheology","Hibler, W.D., A dynamic thermodynamic sea ice model (1979) J.

The performance parameters selected are those that mainly indicate the suitability of a site for solar power development. Using normalised values, a brief comparison with other farms across the globe is made to assess the relative performance of the farm. The results show that its performance is satisfactory, with a weighted performance ratio of 0.70 compared to the global average of 0.70-0.80 for sufficiently well performing farms. However, the performance could be improved with improved operational monitoring of the farm. Additional performance parameters are assessed relative to the standard and the farms in other countries, such as capture and system losses, system efficiencies, and capacity factors, are above the thresholds for satisfactory performance. Measurements at the site show a high solar energy resource in the range of 4.0-7.2kWh/m2/day.

This study examined the effects of rice straw incorporation on total SOC, active SOC fractions, and carbon pool management index (CPMI) in a subtropical paddy field in China. The straw collected after harvesting the early and late paddy was incorporated immediately into the top 10cm soil at a rate of 3.3Mgha-1 and the top 40cm soil samples in the triplicate treatment, control and reference plots were analyzed for the concentrations of total SOC and four other active SOC fractions at the end of the early and late seasons. The concentrations of total soil organic carbon (SOC), light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) were significantly (P<0.05) higher in the straw application plots than in the controls by 7.1-128.6% for both the early and late paddy season. In general, significant and positive correlations were observed between SOC, DOC, LFOC, MBC and labile organic carbon (LOC) in the treatment and control plots for both early and late paddy (r=0.60-0.96, P<0.05). Moreover, there were significant and positive correlations of total SOC and active SOC fractions with both soil water content (r=0.69-0.94, P<0.01) as well as total soil nitrogen content (r=0.69-0.99, P<0.05). Straw incorporation significantly increased CPMI and other active soil organic carbon pools in the early paddy field (P<0.05), but had no significant effects on CPMI in the late paddy field. It is therefore better to incorporate straw residues in the aerobic condition during the early paddy season in order for rice to benefit from an increased CPMI. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Active carbon; Rice paddy; Soil organic matter; Straw incorporation","Bai, J.H., Yang, H.O., Deng, W., Zhu, Y.M., Zhang, X.L., Wang, Q.G., Spatial distribution characteristics of organic matter and total nitrogen of marsh soils in river marginal wetlands (2005) Geoderma, 124, pp. 181-192; Bhattacharyya, P., Roy, K.S., Neogi, S., Adhya, T.K., Rao, K.S., Manna, M.C., Effects of rice straw and nitrogen fertilization on greenhouse gas emissions and carbon storage in tropical flooded soil planted with rice (2012) Soil Till.

Besides all these factors, in particular the wood temperature and moisture content (MC) directly impact on the fungus and its ability to metabolize and degrade wood cell wall substance over time. Therefore the significant role of MC has been addressed in a wide range of field experiments and approaches to establish decay models. However, all these approaches have one crucial aspect in common, i.e. the need for defining a minimum threshold for wood MC that is necessary for the onset of decay and its subsequent progression.The aim of this study was therefore to examine the moisture requirements of different brown and white rot causing basidiomycetes for growth and decay of a wider range of European-grown wood species including moderately durable, durable and even very durable species. Remarkably, the majority of the material/fungus combinations under test it was observed that the minimum MC for fungal decay was more or less distinct below fiber saturation, whereby the highest deviations from MC threshold to FSP were found for beech and Scots pine sapwood, i.e. the wood species with the lowest inherent resistance. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Brown rot; Decay fungi; Mass loss; Moisture content; White rot","Ammer, U., Untersuchungen über das Wachstum von Rotstreifepilzen in Abhängigkeit von der Holzfeuchtigkeit (1963) Forstwiss.

RT is a solidly established methodology that, contrary to other soft-computing approaches, has been under-explored in problems of wind speed prediction in wind farms. In this paper we comparatively evaluate eight different types of RTs algorithms, and we show that they are able obtain excellent results in real problems of very short-term wind speed prediction, improving existing classical and soft-computing approaches such as multi-linear regression approaches, different types of neural networks and support vector regression algorithms in this problem. We also show that RTs have a very small computation time, that allows the retraining of the algorithms whenever new wind speed data are collected from the measuring towers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Regression trees;

This paper addresses the potential importance of gust tracking technologies within the urban environment via the analysis of the additional energy present in the gusty wind resource using high resolution measurements at two urban roof-top locations. Results demonstrate significant additional energy present in the gusty wind resource at high temporal resolution. This energy is usually under-represented by the use of mean wind speeds in quantifying the power in the wind over longer averaging times. The results support the promise of capturing a portion of this extra energy through gust tracking solutions. The sensitivity of this ""additional"" wind energy to averaging time interval is also explored, providing useful information for the design of gust tracking or dynamic control algorithms for small-scale turbines. Relationships between turbulence intensity and excess energy available are drawn. Thus, an analytical model is proposed which may prove useful in predicting the excess energy available across wide areas from, for example, boundary layer turbulence models. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Excess energy content; Small-scale vertical-axis wind turbine; Turbulence intensity; Urban wind","(2008) Climate change act 2008, , The Stationary Office, London, UK; (2008) Energy act 2008, , The Stationary Office, London, UK; Baskut, O., Ozgener, O., Ozgener, L., Second law analysis of wind turbine power plants: Cesme, Izmir example (2011) Energy, 36 (5), pp. 2535-2542; Baskut, O., Ozgener, O., Ozgener, L., Effects of meteorological variables on exergetic efficiency of wind turbine power plants (2010) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 14 (9), pp. 3237-3241; Allen, S.R., Hammond, G.P., McManus, M.C., Prospects for and barriers to domestic micro-generation: a United Kingdom perspective (2008) Appl Energy, 85 (6), pp. 528-544; (2010) Small wind systems, UK market report, , UK; Britter, R., Hanna, S., Flow and dispersion in urban areas (2003) Annu Rev Fluid Mech, 35 (1), pp. 469-496; McIntosh, S., Babinsky, H., Bertenyi, T., Optimizing the energy output of vertical axis wind turbines for fluctuating wind conditions (2007) 45th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, , American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics; Van der Hoven, I., Power spectrum of horizontal wind speed in the frequency range from 0.0007 to 900 cycles per hour (1957) JMeteorol, 14 (2), pp. 160-164; Howell, R., Qin, N., Edwards, J., Durrani, N., Wind tunnel and numerical study of a small vertical axis wind turbine (2010) Renew Energy, 35 (2), pp. 412-422; Pedersen, T., On wind turbine power performance measurements at inclined airflow (2004) Wind Energy, 7 (3), pp. 163-176; Aslam Bhutta, M.M., Hayat, N., Farooq, A.U., Ali, Z., Jamil, S.R., Hussain, Z., Vertical axis wind turbine - a review of various configurations and design techniques (2012) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 16 (4), pp. 1926-1939; Danao, L.A., Eboibi, O., Howell, R., An experimental investigation into the influence of unsteady wind on the performance of a vertical axis wind turbine (2013) Appl Energy, 107, pp. 403-411; Scelba, G., Consoli, A., Gust tracking capability of small direct-drive wind turbines (2010) Sustainable Energy Technologies (ICSET), 2010 IEEE International Conference, pp. 1-6. , IEEE; Acosta, J.L., Combe, K., Djokic, S.Z., Hernando-Gil, I., Performance assessment of micro and small-scale wind turbines in urban areas (2012) Syst J IEEE, 6 (1), pp. 152-163; Hanna, S.R., Brown, M.J., Camelli, F.E., Chan, S.T., Coirier, W.J., Kim, S., Detailed simulations of atmospheric flow and dispersion in downtown Manhattan: an application of five computational fluid dynamics models (2006) Bull Am Meteorological Soc, 87 (12), pp. 1713-1726; Wieringa, J., Gust factors over open water and built-up country (1973) Boundary-Layer Meteorol, 3 (4), pp. 424-441; Jackson, P., The evaluation of windy environments (1978) Build Environ, 13 (4), pp. 251-260; Millward-Hopkins, J.T., Tomlin, A.S., Ma, L., Ingham, D., Pourkashanian, M., Estimating aerodynamic parameters of urban-like surfaces with heterogeneous building heights (2011) Boundary-Layer Meteorol, 141 (3), pp. 443-465; Eliasson, I., Offerle, B., Grimmond, C.S.B., Lindqvist, S., Wind fields and turbulence statistics in an urban street canyon (2006) Atmos Environ, 40, pp. 1-16; Rafailidis, S., Influence of building areal density and roof shape on the wind characteristics above a town (1997) Boundary-Layer Meteorol, 85 (2), pp. 255-271; Bertényi, T., Wickins, C., McIntosh, S., Enhanced energy capture through gust-tracking in the urban wind environment (2010) 48th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Orlando, Florida, USA; Shamshirband, S., Petković, D., Saboohi, H., Anuar, N.B., Inayat, I., Akib, S., Wind turbine power coefficient estimation by soft computing methodologies: comparative study (2014) Energy Convers Manag, 81, pp. 520-526; Abdullah, M., Yatim, A., Tan, C., Saidur, R., Areview of maximum power point tracking algorithms for wind energy systems (2012) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 16 (5), pp. 3220-3227; Penna, P., (2008) Wind tunnel tests of the Quiet Revolution Ltd.

However, recent meta-analysis documented controversial effects on soil-plant interactions and on crop yields response. The data presented in this paper are the results of a field experiment on a processing tomato crop aiming to enhance the knowledge on the real applicability of biochar at farm scale in a high fertility alkaline soil. The effects of two biochar types on soil properties and on quantitative and qualitative parameters of processing tomato were evaluated. Biochar application significantly increased the soil carbon content, the soil cation exchange capacity and the availability of NH<inf>4</inf>+, P and K. Moreover, it stimulated plant growth and N, P and base cation contents at harvest, reducing the leaf water potential in the warmer period. These results demonstrate that also intensive cultivations in fertile soil can benefit from biochar amendment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Intensive agriculture; Processing tomato yield and quality; Soil nutrients","Akhtar, S.S., Li, G.T., Andersen, M.N., Liu, F.L., Biochar enhances yield and quality of tomato under reduced irrigation (2014) Agric.

In addition, salinity has been decreasing in high latitudes and is expected to continue decreasing due to altered precipitation patterns and glacial melting caused by climate change. Many marine organisms that are adapted to the present conditions may be drastically affected by these oceanic changes. Early life stages (larvae and juveniles) should be especially susceptible, since they do not yet have the fully developed morphological defenses of adults. This study investigated the effects of reduced salinity (20 compared to a control of 30) and altered temperature (15, 20, 25, and 29. °C) on the growth, percent inorganic content (representing shell calcification), and feeding rates of larvae and juveniles of the widespread coastal snail Crepidula fornicata. Both larval and juvenile growth rates were significantly depressed at low salinity and lower temperatures. In addition, the salinity that snails were exposed to as larvae significantly impacted their juvenile growth rates in 4 out of 6 treatments, an example of latent effects. The magnitude and direction of this effect were strongly impacted by temperature and parentage. Juvenile feeding rates were significantly depressed following a rapid change in salinity but then gradually recovered to near initial levels over 3. h. There was little difference in the percent inorganic content of juveniles but for larvae that had been reared at 20. °C, percent inorganic content was 27% lower for those reared at a salinity of 20 compared with those reared at 30. In conclusion, the early life stages of C. fornicata may experience more favorable conditions in a warmer future: growth rates will increase, probably making larvae and juveniles less vulnerable to size-specific predation. Conversely, in regions where salinity is decreasing, C. fornicata larvae and juveniles will likely grow more slowly, thereby increasing predation risk by forcing them to spend more time at more vulnerable smaller sizes. Thus, the future of C. fornicata and their potential to continue invading new habitats will depend greatly on the specific salinity and temperature conditions they will be exposed to throughout larval and juvenile development. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Crepidula; Juvenile; Larva; Latent effects; Salinity; Temperature","Almada-Villela, P.C., The effects of reduced salinity on the shell growth of small Mytilus edulis (1984) J.

The Desertification Trend Risk Index (DTRI) adds the mean slope of each factor in a time series, thereby classifying the risk of desertification according to four categories: low, medium, high and extreme. This index is based on Landsat images and population data from 1993 to 2011, as well as climatological data from 1980 to 2010. An analysis using a combination matrix is also presented to identify the driving forces in each category. In addition, a change vector analysis (CVA) is performed to evaluate changes in land use in the semi-arid highlands of central Mexico. The results show that the semi-arid areas of the municipalities of Querétaro, Santa Catarina, Corregidora, Apaseo el Alto and Celaya represent extreme alert regions. In general, anthropic activities such as changes in land use and deforestation are the primary driving forces in the desertification process in the region. Based on the results of this study, the use of the DTRI is recommended as a low-cost and easily applied tool to assess and monitor desertification. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","CVA; Desertification; Remote sensing; Semi-arid highlands","Babiker, A., Urbanization and desertification in the Sudan with special reference to Khartoum (1982) GeoJournal, 6 (1), pp. 69-76; Barbero-Sierra, C., Marques, M.J., Ruíz-Pérez, M., The case of urban sprawl in Spain as an active and irreversible driving force for desertification (2013) J.Arid Environ., 90, pp. 95-102; Birkmann, J., Conclusions and recommendations (2006) Measuring Vulnerability to Natural Hazard.

Although anti-desertification efforts have been mounted worldwide, most undertakings have shown poor performance because of failure to consider soil and geotechnical aspects. Soil erosion is accelerated by reductions in soil cohesion and water retention due to the transfer of fine particles from the original ground. Thus, soil internal cohesion must be recovered to ensure effective and reliable anti-desertification attempts. In this study, soil treatment using biopolymers is suggested as an alternative method to prevent soil erosion and for revitalization, taking into consideration engineering and environmental aspects. Even as a relatively small part of the soil mass (i.e., 0.5-1.0%), biopolymers in soil have the positive potential to significantly reduce the erodibility of soil by enhancing inter-particle cohesion. Moreover, biopolymer treatment also improves both vegetation germination and soil water retention characteristics against evaporation, and therefore can provide suitable environments for plants and crops used as a desertification countermeasure in arid and semi-arid regions where annual precipitation is limited. We suggest combining biopolymers with pre-existing anti-desertification efforts (e.g., afforestation and windbreaks) on desert fronts (i.e., boundaries between arid and semi-arid regions) for best efficiency. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Anti-desertification; Biopolymer; Desertification; Soil erosion; Vegetation growth","Agassi, M., Ben-Hur, M., Stabilizing steep slopes with soil conditioners and plants (1992) Soil Technol., 5 (3), pp. 249-256; Al-Darby, A.M., The hydraulic properties of a sandy soil treated with gel-forming soil conditioner (1996) Soil Technol., 9 (1-2), pp. 15-28; Balba, A.M., (1995) Management of Problem Soils in Arid Ecosystems, , CRC Press; (2013) Biodegradable Polymers, , BCC Research; Ben-Hur, M., Letey, J., Effect of polysaccharides, clay dispersion, and impact energy on water infiltration (1989) Soil Sci.

Recent studies highlight the importance of identifying the role of marine coastal communities in carbon exchanges. Our objective was to couple macrozoobenthos abundance data from long-term monitoring with species metabolism rates to contribute to the estimation of CO<inf>2</inf> fluxes from an intertidal exposed rocky shore community at a regional scale. The carbon fluxes due to respiration and calcification were calculated both during emersion and immersion, and the effect of temperature variation on carbon emissions was then predicted. Spatial and temporal natural variations of carbon fluxes were investigated and the contribution of exposed intertidal rocky shore communities to regional carbon emissions was calculated. The method was used to calculate the carbon budget allowed to account for the natural spatial variability of the community composition and carbon emissions. Mean annual calculated CO<inf>2</inf> emission was 14.3molCm-2yr-2, and the annual regional CO<inf>2</inf> flux was estimated at 2978tCyr-1. Simulations showed that the potential feedback of a rise in temperature of 1°C would lead to an increase of 4-7% in carbon emissions for this type of community. The results give a first quantification of intertidal exposed rocky shore carbon emissions that could be considered in evaluating further the global CO<inf>2</inf> budget. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon flux; Intertidal environment; Long-term monitoring; Metabolism; Rocky shore; Temperature variations","Babarro, J.M.F., Fernández-Reiriz, M.J., Labarta, U., Metabolism of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis from two origins in the Ría de Arousa (north-west Spain) (2000) J.

However, land-use management influences the quantity and quality of carbon (C) inputs which may, in turn, affect microbial activity and soil C decomposition rates. Understanding the potential changes in magnitude of soil C loss through respiration is critical for a comprehensive assessment of land-use conversion and grassland management impacts on terrestrial C dynamics. Thus, this study was designed to assess the effect of land-use management intensification on soil respiration in subtropical grasslands. Experimental sites consisted of a gradient of management intensities ranging from native rangeland (lowest), silvopasture (intermediate), to sown pasture (highest). Increasing management intensity from native rangeland to sown pasture elevated soil respiration. There was a significant effect of 'season vs. management' interaction on total soil respiration (R<inf>S</inf>), with greater increases in R<inf>S</inf> from summer to winter in sown pasture (∼200%) compared to native rangeland and silvopasture (∼91%). The temperature sensitivity of R<inf>S</inf> and heterotrophic soil respiration (R<inf>H</inf>) increased with management intensification, with a highest Q<inf>10</inf> of 1.55 and 2.29, in sown pasture, compared to Q<inf>10</inf> values of 1.09 and 1.48 in native rangelands. These results suggested that potential increases in soil C stock with intensification may be susceptible to faster turnover under warming climate scenarios. Improved resilience (and longer residence) of additionally sequestered soil C after intensification may be crucial for long-term ecological resilience, especially with changing climatic conditions. These findings are relevant for sustainable grassland management, especially within subtropical ecoregions, and add to the understanding of changes that may occur in rates of soil C losses as native grasslands are converted to more productive grassland ecosystems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Adachi, M., Bekku, Y.S., Rashidah, W., Okuda, T., Koizumi, H., Differences in soil respiration between different tropical ecosystems (2006) Appl.

Parameters that influence the performance include the geometrical lay-out of the park, the number of wave energy converters and their dimensions and separating distance, as well as the wave climate and the incoming wave spectral characteristics. However, the complexity of the simulations increases rapidly with growing number of interacting units, and simulations become a severe challenge that calls for new methods. Here we address the problem of rapid phase oscillations appearing in the simulation of large arrays of point absorbers using potential theory for the structure-fluid interaction. We do this by analytically integrating out the factors that are causing the oscillations. Our group has successfully utilized this method to model parks with up to 1000 point absorbers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The data were used to implement measure-correlate-predict (MCP) approaches at 37 sites throughout the United Kingdom (UK). The monthly and hourly linear correlation between the UK4-predicted and observed wind speeds indicates that UK4 is capable of representing the wind climate better than the nearby meteorological stations considered. Linear MCP algorithms were implemented at the same sites using reference data from UK4 and nearby meteorological stations to predict the long-term (10-year) wind resource. To obtain robust error statistics, MCP algorithms were applied using onsite measurement periods of 1-12 months initiated at 120 different starting months throughout an 11 year data record. Using linear regression MCP over 12 months, the average percentage errors in the long-term predicted mean wind speed and power density were 3.0% and 7.6% respectively, using UK4, and 2.8% and 7.9% respectively, using nearby meteorological stations. The results indicate that UK4 is highly competitive with nearby meteorological observations as an MCP reference data source. UK4 was also shown to systematically improve MCP predictions at coastal sites due to better representation of local diurnal effects. © 2015.","Measure-correlate-predict; Numerical weather prediction;

The Gulf of Mexico is its primary source of conventional resources. The economic and environmental uncertainties arising from the widespread use of hydrocarbons, oil and natural gas make it necessary to develop indigenous renewable sources to promote the transition to a diversified energy mix, thus achieving a more sustainable energy model. Solar resources are important because of the high radiation levels throughout the country. Although use of solar power is conditioned by the climatic and meteorological characteristics of the area, it is likely to be applied in both electrical and thermal systems.The coastal region of the Gulf of Mexico is characterized by a warm, humid climate and rugged terrain, with elevations over 1000m. These conditions mean that in the central and southern areas, solar radiation is mainly diffuse. However, studies indicate that in spring and summer global irradiation can reach 4kWh/m2day in the central and southern regions, and ascend to 6.7kWh/m2day in the northwest. These levels are suitable for the development of solar photovoltaic energy and low temperature thermal installations, since the degree of cloud cover in these zones complicates the use of Concentrated Solar Power technology. © 2015.","Mexico; Renewable; Solar energy; Solar technologies","Mekhilef, S., Saidur, R., Safari, A., Areview on solar energy use in industries.

Congo). Human exposure to trace metals at the site has become a primary environmental concern. This study evaluated different strategies (spontaneous and assisted phytostabilisation) to promote plant establishment on bare soil at the contamination site for soil reclamation/remediation. First, soil chemical properties were assessed in three vegetation units (bare soil, metallophytic grassland patches, and termite mounds). Results showed lower nutrients, organic matter content, and pH in bare soil; however increased metal concentrations were not detected. Limestone (0, 2.5, 5, and 10tha-1) and compost (0, 45, and 225tha-1) were applied in a factorial design. Plant establishment was monitored for three years; and leaf TM concentration was assessed during the third year. Soil amendments improved bare soil conditions (higher pH and nutrients and lower TMs), and facilitated spontaneous plant establishment, with compost exhibiting the largest positive effects. Colonisers were primarily annual species; either true metallophytes or weedy taxa, which were sporadically present at the study site. However, only the perennial Microchloa altera survived during the 6-month dry season. Following three years of phytostabilisation experiment with M. altera by planting, substantial growth and high survival was observed in M. altera. A combination of soil amendments (lime and compost) was most effective to improve plant fecundity, and reduce metal uptake by leaves. Our results show promise for reclamation of bare soil contaminated by the mining industry in tropical climate. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Amendments; Copper; Copper flora; Heavy metals; Katanga; Phytoremediation; Phytostabilization; Spontaneous and assisted revegetation; Tropical africa","Ayres, R.U., Ayres, L.W., Rade, I., The life cycle of copper, its co-products and by-products.

Therefore, the goal of this study is to provide results and directions for future development of the main economic sectors in Taiwan, through analyzing nine long-term (2050) carbon reduction pathways from the technical perspectives. This study utilized the MARKAL energy engineering model to simulate the effects of adopting a combination of technology and tax measures under the various carbon reduction targets and low-carbon development scenarios up to 2050 in Taiwan. The main economic sectors studied include the electricity, industry, household and service, and transportation sectors, while Taiwan's carbon emission reduction targets for 2050 are set as carbon emissions reduced to 50-100% of 2000 levels, or 79-89% below the BAU levels. The study results show that if Taiwan's GDP grows with an annual rate of 3% from 2013 to 2055, and with only limited low/no carbon energy development in place, all sectors in Taiwan need to decrease their energy intensities below the BAU scenario by 48% to 53%, in order for Taiwan to achieve its carbon reduction targets for 2050. However, for all sectors to take up energy saving measures and CCS technologies to reduce energy demand and energy intensity, Taiwan will have to quickly adopt new climate legislation (e.g. Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act) and introduce carbon-reduction incentives (e.g., carbon tax). The study results are expected to provide important information for the policy makers in developing Taiwan's long-term low carbon development pathways. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Their great advantage is that they can be applied in environments outside the cities in which they have been developed and evaluated. Thus, they may be applied to cities in the economically developing world, which are growing rapidly, and where the results of such models may have greatest impact with respect to informing planning decisions. However, data requirements, particularly for the more complex urban models, represent a major obstacle to their employment. Here, we examine the potential for running the Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance model (SUEWS) using readily obtained data. SUEWS was designed to simulate energy and water balance terms at a neighbourhood scale (≥1km2) and requires site-specific meteorological data and a detailed description of the surface. Here, its simulations are evaluated by comparison with measurements made over a seven month (approximately 3 seasons) period (April-October) at two flux tower sites (representing urban and suburban landscapes) in Dublin, Ireland. However, the main purpose of this work is to test the performance of the model under 'ideal' and 'imperfect' circumstances in relation to the input data required to run SUEWS. The ideal case uses detailed urban land cover data and meteorological data from the tower sites. The imperfect cases use parameters derived from the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification scheme and meteorological data from a standard weather station located beyond the urban area. For the period of record examined, the simulations show good agreement with the observations in both ideal and imperfect cases, suggesting that the model can be used with data that is more easily derived. The comparison also shows the importance of including vegetative cover and of the initial moisture state in simulating the urban energy budget. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Landcover; LCZ; SUEWS; UEB; Urban","Alexander, P.J., Mills, G., Local climate classification and Dublin's urban heat island (2014) Atmosphere, 5 (4), pp. 755-777; Arnfield, J., Two decades of urban climate research: a review of turbulence, exchanges of energy and water, and the urban heat island (2003) Int.

Gronostajowa 7, Kraków, Poland","Patterned grounds are probably the most interesting features produced by natural processes acting on the Earth's surface. Such features occur mainly in polar areas and in high mountains indicating that the origin of patterned grounds is related to frost action and cryoturbation. In spite of the many studies concerning the mechanism of the formation and the various forms of patterned grounds, very little attention has been paid to the qualitative and quantitative analyses of their mineral composition, and especially the mineralogy of the clay fraction. The analysis of the mineralogy of clay fraction is very important due to the finest particles (especially clay minerals) may play a crucial role in cryoturbation and cryosegregation as the particles are mainly responsible for accumulation of water and rheological properties of the ground. Thus, the main aim of the present study was to verify the hypothesis that the presence of swelling clay minerals in parent material favors the development of sorted patterned grounds. To verify the hypothesis, the physical, chemical, micromorphological, and qualitative and quantitative mineralogical properties of Cryosols from sorted and unsorted patterned grounds in the Hornsund area (SW Spitsbergen) were determined. The obtained results show that Turbic Cryosols from sorted patterned grounds featuring clear frost cracking, frost segregation, and cryoturbation are characterized by a lack of clearly developed soil horizons, loamy texture and low content of soil organic matter. Haplic Cryosols show better developed soil horizonation and contain lower amounts of the silt and clay fractions, higher content of the sand fraction and soil organic matter in comparison with Turbic Cryosols exhibiting strong cryoturbation. Micromorphological analysis of Turbic Cryosols indicates frost action manifested by a vesicular microstructure; round, oval, and deformed (mammillated) vesicles as dominant voids; vertically-oriented rock fragments; and silt and silt-clay cappings occurring on rock fragments. In addition, the occurrence of Fe-Mn nodules showing a sharp boundary indicates mixing of soil material. Micromorphology of the studied Turbic Cryosols indicates that cryoturbation prevails over cryosegregation. The soil material of the studied Cryosols is composed mainly of quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase, dioctahedral mica (muscovite and/or illite), biotite, augite, hornblende, garnet, chlorite, swelling clays (smectite, vermiculite), goethite, and in some cases also calcite and traces of kaolinite. Majority of the minerals are most likely primary minerals inherited from parent material due to weak chemical weathering in the severe Arctic climate conditions and relatively young soils. However, weak chemical weathering of biotite and formation of vermiculite and mixed layered clay minerals also take place. Quantitative mineralogical analysis shows that besides texture and moisture, the mineral composition of soil material may also play some role in the susceptibility to cryoturbation and the formation of sorted and unsorted patterned grounds. However, the small differences in mineral content between the studied Turbic Cryosols and Haplic Cryosols indicate that the mineral composition of parent material is not a crucial characteristic responsible for the formation of sorted patterned grounds. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Clay minerals; Cryosols; Cryoturbation; Patterned ground; Spitsbergen","Bockheim, J.G., Tarnocai, C., Recognition of cryoturbation for classifying permafrost-affected soils (1998) Geoderma, 81, pp. 281-293; Bockheim, J.G., Mazhitova, G., Kimble, J.M., Tarnocai, C., Controversies on the genesis and classification of permafrost-affected soils (2006) Geoderma, 137, pp. 33-39; Bölter, M., Soil development and soil biology on King George Island, Maritime Antarctic (2011) Pol.

This study filled in this gap by assessing the response of detritivores and microorganisms to three levels of Na subsidies (0.005%, 0.05% and 0.5% water solution of NaCl) during the decomposition of broad-leaf and needle litter in a subtropical forest (Nanjing, China, 300. km inland from Pacific ocean). The relative contributions of detritivores vs microbes to litter decomposition were tested using litterbags with 5. mm and 0.2. mm mesh. Litter mass loss, soil microbial respiration, and soil enzyme activities were investigated in an eight-month field experiment. Our results showed that both 0.05 and 0.5% Na subsidies increased invertebrate detritivore decomposition of litter at least 1.5 fold, while it decreased the microbial contribution to litter decomposition by ≥7.2%. However, low-level Na subsidies (0.005%) increased microbial, but not detritivore, activity in recalcitrant litter. Despite enhanced litter mass loss from invertebrate detritivores, we found decreased microbial enzyme activities involved in carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling under high (0.5%) Na subsidies. This suggests that at 0.5% of Na, microbes experience Na-toxicity and mineralization of C, N, and P nutrients likely decreased in forest ecosystems. These results suggest that neither Na shortage nor Na excess would be unfavorable for carbon-release. As increased with anthropogenic input or climate change in the future, sodium may have multiple effects on soil organic matter dynamics, ecosystem biogeochemical cycling, and plant nutrition through regulating microbial processes in forests. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Brown food webs; Nutrient limitation; Sodium subsidies; Soil fauna; Soil microbial respiration","Allison, S.D., Lu, Y., Weihe, C., Goulden, M.L., Martiny, A.C., Treseder, K.K., Martiny, J.B., Microbial abundance and composition influence litter decomposition response to environmental change (2013) Ecology, 94, pp. 714-725; Bailey, V.L., Peacock, A.D., Smith, J.L., Bolton, H., Relationships between soil microbial biomass determined by chloroform fumigation-extraction substrate-induced respiration, and phospholipid fatty acid analysis (2002) Soil Biol.

Hourly planning of the microgrid operation is performed, taking into consideration certain characteristics of the grid and the units, together with local climate data that impact the output of non-dispatchable renewable resources. The proposed formulation constitutes a nonlinear programming problem that is solved by a sequential quadratic programming method. The model is then applied for a test case microgrid, examining both grid-connected and standalone operation. Two alternative objective functions are investigated: (a) the minimization of the total annual energy losses (TAEL), and (b) the minimization of the cost of energy (COE). Depending on the considered objective function, the results show a significant reduction in either the TAEL or the COE for the grid-connected microgrid, as well as a higher degree of independence from the main grid, which provides the capability of standalone operation. In this case, the energy storage systems play the most crucial role. Consequently, the results prove the positive effect of the proposed simultaneous capacity optimization of energy storage and DG in the cases of grid-connected and standalone microgrid operation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we study the potential of those batteries to be used in second-life applications to enable the expansion of intermittent renewable electricity supply in California through the year 2050. We develop and apply a parametric life-cycle system model integrating battery supply, degradation, logistics, and second-life use. We calculate and compare several metrics of second-life system performance, including cumulative electricity delivered, energy balance, greenhouse gas (GHG) balance, and energy stored on invested. We find that second-life use of retired PEV batteries may play a modest, though not insignificant, role in California's future energy system. The electricity delivered by second-life batteries in 2050 under base-case modeling conditions is 15 TWh per year, about 5% of total current and projected electricity use in California. If used instead of natural gas-fired electricity generation, this electricity would reduce GHG emissions by about 7 million metric tons of CO<inf>2</inf>e per year in 2050. © 2015, Elsevier B.V.

Fluorescence recordings were validated against established non-invasive optical methods based on reflection and remittance and against a visual colour classification scheme. Fruit ripening, as influenced by water supply (pre-harvest) and light quality (postharvest), was monitored by chlorophyll fluorescence indices (red and far-red fluorescence) after red and UV, red and green, or green and UV excitation. Chlorophyll breakdown was indicated by the fluorescence index NBI_R, which showed a negative and strong correlation with the reflection index a*/b* (R2=-0.798) and the remittance based stage-index (R2=-0.754). Characteristic curve patterns of the indices NBI_G, FLAV and Anth_RG enabled the pink (NBI_G, FLAV) and light red (Anth_RG) ripening stages to be defined and were well suited to detecting time-shifts in the ripening process. The potential of this technique for improved ripening monitoring and quality attribute determination in tomatoes is discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Chlorophyll fluorescence; External fruit colour; Fruit quality; Non-destructive analysis; Sensors","Abbott, J.A., Quality measurement of fruits and vegetables (1999) Postharvest Biol.

Rising temperatures can dramatically affect multiple cropping systems and, as a consequence, food security in China. Here, we investigate the impacts of climate change on the northern limits and crop planting areas of multiple cropping systems in China, and estimate the impacts of the change in the crop planting areas of multiple cropping systems on the China's crop production (maize, wheat, and rice). Based on both historical climate observations from the China Meteorological Administration and future climate A1B emission scenario (IPCC, 2007) data for China, we evaluate the effects of climate change on multiple cropping systems in China. Historical statistical crop yield and simulated crop yield by Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM model) in 2011-2100 were used to quantify the crop production (maize, wheat, and rice) in China. We found that the northern limits of multiple cropping systems have been shifted northward. The projected area of cultivated land for triple-cropping system may significantly expand during the 21st century. The northern shifts resulted in a 2.2% (~8,000,000. t) increase in national production of three major crops (maize, wheat, and rice) during the period from 1981 to 2010, positively impacting China's food security. Therefore, we conclude that the warming due to climate change may cause a positive impact on the crop production in China if concomitant changes adapted in multiple cropping systems take place. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","China; Climate change; Crop planting area; Crop productivity; Food security; Multiple cropping systems","Bassu, S., Asseng, S., Motzo, R., Giunta, F., Optimising sowing date of durum wheat in a variable Mediterranean environment (2009) Field Crops Res., 111, pp. 109-118; Bouman, B.A.M., van Laar, H.H., Description and evaluation of the rice growth model ORYZA2000 under nitrogen-limited conditions (2006) Agric.

Here we present a palynological sequence and discuss the past vegetation and climate changes based on core BY10A from the Swan Lake, an alpine lake situated at an inter-montane basin in the central Tienshan Mountains, Xinjiang, northwestern China. We collected 52 modern pollen surface samples at different elevations to aid in the interpretation of fossil-pollen data, which provide a reconstruction of vegetation and climate history for the last 8.5. ka (1. ka. =. 1000. cal. yr BP). Artemisia and Amaranthaceae (=. Chenopodiaceae) are the main pollen types in desert steppe zone below 1800. m elevation, while Poaceae and Picea dominate the mid-elevation forest steppe zone (1800-2800. m). Cyperaceae is the main indicator of high alpine meadows (>. 2800. m). From 8.5 to 6.9. ka, the vegetation was steppe meadow suggesting relatively warm climate. From 6.9 to 2.6. ka generally high values of Cyperaceae and peaty sediments indicate a fen environment and cooler, more humid conditions. Interrupting this mid-Holocene period is a 5.5-4.5. ka millennium of lacustrine sediments with lower Cyperaceae, higher Poaceae and Artemisia, and high values of Myriophyllum and Pediastrum indicating higher water levels and warmer temperatures. After 2.6. ka, pollen data indicate alpine steppe and warmer climate. The mid-Holocene pattern of cooler climate interrupted by a warmer period is consistent from other regional records from Xinjiang, including the Guliya ice core and Kesang Cave speleothem record. During the cooler periods, the regional record indicates that a weakened summer Asian monsoon is countered to some extent by a stronger winter monsoon. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Holocene; Paleoenvironment; Palynology; Tienshan Mountains; Vegetation history","An, C.B., Lu, Y.B., Zhao, J.J., Tao, S.C., Dong, W.M., Li, H., Jin, M., Wang, Z.L., A high-resolution record of Holocene environmental and climatic changes from Lake Balikun (Xinjiang, China): implications for central Asia (2012) The Holocene, 10 (1), pp. 1-10; Andersen, K.K., Azuma, N., Barnola, J.M., Bigler, M., Biscaye, P., Caillon, N., Chappellaz, J., White, J.W.C., High-resolution record of Northern Hemisphere climate extending into the last interglacial period (2004) Nature, 431, pp. 147-151; Blyakharchuk, T.A., Wright, H.E., Borodavko, P.S., vander Knaap, W.O., Ammann, B., Late Glacial and Holocene vegetational history of the Altai Mountains (southwestern Tuva Republic, Siberia) (2007) Palaeogeogr.

However, the lack of well-dated records of climate and environmental changes, which are frequently cited as important drivers of early human evolution, impede understanding of the evolution and dispersal of humans on the Beijing plain. A 150-m deep drill core was collected from the Changping District of the Beijing plain to reconstruct the changes in vegetation and climate during the Middle Pleistocene using pollen records. The results indicated that the tree genus Ulmus and the herb genus Artemisia were dominant in most of the samples from 0.96 to 0.61 Ma, reflecting an open forest steppe covering the Beijing region. Between 0.61 and 0.44 Ma, the vegetation communities shifted to an Artemisia-steppe as the tree cover declined. This was followed by a further shift in vegetation community structure to a Chenopodiaceae-Asteraceae steppe between 0.44 and 0.23 Ma, followed by the conversion to an Artemisia-Asteraceae steppe after 0.23 Ma. The pollen record revealed a long-term deterioration of the vegetation, which indicated an increasing trend of drying and cooling in the Beijing plain during the Middle Pleistocene. This coincides with the Homo erectus colonization of North China during this period. These findings provide supporting evidence that a shift in climate towards cold and dry conditions during the Middle Pleistocene may have directly benefited Homo erectus populations in open habitats of North China. This general pattern of declining vegetation cover in the study area is consistent with climatic and environmental patterns in other regions of North China, which were probably influenced by global cooling during the Middle Pleistocene. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Beijing; Homo erectus; Middle Pleistocene; Pollen","Ao, H., Deng, C.L., Dekkers, M.J., Sun, Y.B., Liu, Q.S., Zhu, R.X., Pleistocene environmental evolution in the Nihewan Basin and implication for early human colonization of North China (2010) Quat.

Understanding the high-latitude reef-growth process and its correlation to climate change may provide important insights into future reef growth at even higher latitudes in response to global warming. We conducted field surveys and obtained seven cores from the raised reefs of Kodakara Island (29°N, 129°E) in the NWP to determine the changes in and response of reef growth dynamics to millennial-scale climate change through the Holocene. To reconstruct the timing of the reef growth, 37 coral ages were determined using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating. The island is characterized by three Holocene reef terraces (Terraces I to III), which were uplifted ca. 2.4 ka, 1.0-0.4 ka, and in the modern era. Three growth hiatuses occurred circa 5.9-5.8 ka, 4.4-4.0 ka, and 3.3-3.2 ka, which correlate with millennial-scale climate changes (Hamanaka et al., 2012). The reef growth began at least 8ka. Relatively rapid vertical growth of 3.6-3.3m kyr-1 occurred between 8 and 6ka. The reef started growing near land and then gradually extended seaward. The reef growth around the reef slope decelerated after 6ka and most likely coincided with the first and second hiatuses detected landward. In contrast with the reef flat, which resumed its growth after the third hiatus event, the reef mound accretion on the slope ceased definitively. Terrace I was uplifted ca. 2.4 ka. The reef growth reactivated ca. 1.3 ka, and the reef grew at a rate of 9.1m kyr-1 between 1.3 and 1.0 ka; this rate is the fastest growth recorded in this study. This time interval corresponds to the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA). The cause of the delayed reef growth between 2.4 and 1.4 ka remains unclear, but it may imply the existence of a late Holocene hiatus due to a weaker Kuroshio Current (KC) ca. 1.7ka and to strong El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity between 2 and 1.5ka in the East Pacific. The timing of the hiatuses agrees with the weakening of the KC and the more frequent El Niño events during the positive phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), whereas the rapid growth coincides with La Niña conditions, such as the MCA, during the negative phase of the PDO. Our results indicate that the climate event at approximately 4. ka caused the largest change in the reef growth, and it may have affected reefs throughout the Pacific region. Specifically, the ENSO and PDO phases may have impacted the reef growth and KC behavior. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Coral reef growth; ENSO; Hiatus; Holocene; PDO; The Northwest Pacific","Baker, A.C., Glynn, P.W., Riegl, B., Climate change and coral reef bleaching: an ecological assessment of long-term impacts, recovery trends and future outlook (2008) Estuar.

Although both climatic and biotic stressors have been studied separately, much less is known on how drought and pathogens interact and induce dieback, particularly in formerly used forests. We determine the roles played by each of those drivers as factors causing recent dieback in three Pyrenean silver fir stands: a managed site subjected to past logging and two unmanaged sites not logged for the past 50 years. The age, size, recent competition, and basal-area increment (BAI) trends of non-declining and declining trees, and the presence of fungal pathogens were investigated. Growth patterns at yearly to decadal time scales were compared to distinguish the roles and interactions played by the different stressors. In the managed site, declining trees displayed low growth already before logging (1950-1970s). In both unmanaged sites, declining and non-declining trees displayed divergent growth patterns after extreme droughts, indicating that dieback was triggered by severe water deficit. We did not find indications that fungal pathogens are the primary drivers of dieback, since a low proportion of declining trees were infested by primary pathogens (10%). However, trees with the primary fungal pathogen Heterobasidion showed lower BAI than non-declining trees. On the other hand, the secondary fungal pathogen Amylostereum was isolated from a higher number of trees than expected by chance. These findings highlight the importance of legacies, such as the past use in driving recent forest dieback. Past forest use could predispose to dieback by selecting slow-growing trees and thus, making some them more vulnerable to drought and fungal pathogens. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Abies alba; Climate warming; Dencroecology; Drought stress; Forest die-off; Root-rot fungi","Adams, H.D., Guardiola-Claramonte, M., Barron-Gafford, G.A., Villegas, J.C., Breshears, D.D., Zou, C.B., Troch, P.A., Huxman, T.E., Temperature sensitivity of drought-induced tree mortality portends increased regional die-off under global-change-type drought (2009) Proc.

Growing season drought stress is a common occurrence after snowmelt-derived soil water content (WC) and stream flow (Q) have declined, leading to an increase in atmospheric water demand (i.e., vapor pressure deficit, VPD). Here, we analyzed a 6-year record (2006-2011) of H<inf>2</inf>O and CO<inf>2</inf> fluxes from the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest, a montane forest in the northern Rocky Mountains to examine (1) how growing season evapotranspiration (ET), net ecosystem production (NEP), and water-use efficiency (WUE, NEP/ET) respond to changing WC and VPD, (2) how stream flow (Q), an integrated measure of catchment-level water availability, relates to NEP, and (3) how annual NEP is related to annual precipitation and the temperature-defined growing season length (GSL). Growing season NEP exhibited a linear relationship with WC and a log-linear relationship with Q, indicative of persistent water limitations when streamflow and soil moisture reach their annual minima late in the growing season. Nevertheless, years with long GSLs had relatively higher NEP, with a small net carbon sink maintained even at low levels of WC and Q, suggesting that trees are able to obtain water from deeper portions of the soil profile (>30cm) during droughts. However, the warmer, drier climate projected for this region could bring this system closer to a critical threshold of GSL, WC, and VPD, introducing vegetation water stress that could alter the current relationship between GSL and annual NEP. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide flux; Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Net ecosystem exchange; Net ecosystem production; Stream flow; Subalpine forests; Water-use efficiency","Allen, C.D., A global overview of drought and heat-induced tree mortality reveals emerging climate change risks for forests (2010) For.

Atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> has been measured on Rishiri Island (45.1°N, 141.2°E) in the western North Pacific since May 2006. We report the first 7-year temporal CO<inf>2</inf> variations from diurnal to inter-annual scales and the implications on the vegetation phenology. Diurnally, an obvious cycle appeared as a minimum in the afternoon and maximum at midnight in the summer months, caused by local vegetation. Seasonally, the maximum CO<inf>2</inf> concentration appeared around the beginning of April, while the minimum appeared around the middle of August. This seasonal variation implied the natural cycle of terrestrial biological activities of the boreal forest, mostly in the east Eurasia. A mean growing season length of ~126days was estimated. In the period from 2007 to 2012, the peak-to-peak amplitude increased until 2009 and decreased thereafter, with a mean value of 19.7ppm.

To reduce this uncertainty, we here quantify two questions for the power system of Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland): First, when compared within the same high-resolution modeling framework, how much do different combinations of technologies differ in these three respects? Second, how strongly does the cost and availability of grid-scale storage affect overall system cost, and would it favor some technology combinations above others? We compare three main possible generation technologies: (1) renewables, (2) nuclear, and (3) fossil fuels (with/without carbon capture and storage). Our results show that across a wide range of these combinations, the overall costs remain similar, implying that different configurations are equally feasible both technically and economically. However, the most economically favorable scenarios are not necessarily favorable in terms of emissions or energy security. The availability of grid-scale storage in scenarios with little dispatchable generation can reduce overall levelized electricity cost by up to 50%, depending on storage capacity costs. The UK can rely on its domestic wind and solar PV generation at lower renewable shares, with levelized costs only rising more than 10% above the mean of 0.084 GBP/kWh for shares of 50% and below at a 70% share, which is 35% higher. However, for more than an 80% renewable generation share to be economically feasible, large-scale storage, significantly more power imports, or domestic dispatchable renewables like tidal range must be available. © 2015 The Authors.","Energy policy;

The spatial distribution of the fire pixels during the period of 2003-2012 leads to the identification of two most affected sub-regions, namely the Northern and Western parts of the Iberian Peninsula (NWIP) and Northern Africa (NAFR). The temporal distribution of the fire pixels in these two sub-regions is characterized by: (i) high and non-concurrent inter- and intra-annual variability with maximum values during the summer of 2003 and 2005 in NWIP and 2007 and 2012 in NAFR; and, (ii) high intra-annual variability dominated by a prominent annual cycle with a main peak centred in August in both sub-regions and a less pronounced secondary peak in March only evident in NWIP region. The 34 EEs identified were grouped according to the location, period of occurrence and spatial configuration of the associated synoptic patterns into 3 clusters (NWIP-summer, NWIP-winter and NAFR-summer). Results from the composite analysis reveal similar fire weather conditions (statistically significant positive anomalies of air temperature and negative anomalies of air relative humidity) but associated with different circulation patterns at lower and mid-levels of the atmosphere associated with the occurrence of EEs in each cluster of the Western Mediterranean region. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric circulation patterns; Extreme fire activity; Fire pixels; Fire weather; Mediterranean; MODIS","Amraoui, M., DaCamara, C.C., Pereira, J.M.C., Detection and monitoring of African vegetation fires using MSG-SEVIRI imagery (2010) Remote Sens.

Field procedures used for estimating methane emission rates require expensive equipment, are time consuming, and highly variable between farms. The purpose of this paper is to report a simple laboratory procedure for estimating methane emission from stored manure. The test developed was termed a methane production rate (MPR) assay as it provides a short-term biogas production measurement. The MPR assay incubation time is short (3d), requires no sample preparation in terms of inoculation or dilution of manure, is incubated at room temperature, and the manure is kept stationary. These conditions allow for high throughput of samples and were chosen to replicate the conditions within deep-pit manure storages. In brief, an unaltered aliquot of manure was incubated at room temperature for a three-days to assay the current rate of methane being generated by the manure. The results from this assay predict an average methane emission factor of 12.2±8.1kg CH<inf>4</inf> head-1 yr-1 per year, or about 5.5±3.7kg CH<inf>4</inf> per finished animal, both of which compare well to literature values of 5.5±1.1kg CH<inf>4</inf> per finished pig for deep-pit systems (Liu etal., 2013). The average methane flux across all sites and months was estimated to be 22±17mg CH<inf>4</inf> m-2-min-1, which is within literature values for deep-pit systems ranging from 0.24 to 63mg CH<inf>4</inf> m-2-min-1 (Park etal., 2006) and similar to the 15mg CH<inf>4</inf> m-2-min-1 estimated by (Zahn etal., 2001). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Liquid manure; Manure management; Manure storage; Methane production; Methane production rate assay; Methane response to temperature","Ahring, B.K., Sandberg, M., Angelidaki, I., Volatile fatty acids as indicators of process imbalance in anaerobic digesters (1995) Appl.

Especially for complex mountainous watersheds, surface runoff simulations are significantly affected by the overland flow generation, which is closely related to the rainfall characteristics at a sub-time step. In this paper, the sub-daily variability of rainfall intensity was considered using a probability distribution, and a chance-constrained overland flow modeling approach was proposed to capture the generation of overland flow within conceptual distributed hydrologic simulations. The integrated modeling procedures were further demonstrated through a watershed of China Three Gorges Reservoir area, leading to an improved SLURP-TGR hydrologic model based on SLURP. Combined with rainfall thresholds determined to distinguish various magnitudes of daily rainfall totals, three levels of significance were simultaneously employed to examine the hydrologic-response simulation. Results showed that SLURP-TGR could enhance the model performance, and the deviation of runoff simulations was effectively controlled. However, rainfall thresholds were so crucial for reflecting the scaling effect of rainfall intensity that optimal levels of significance and rainfall threshold were 0.05 and 10. mm, respectively. As for the Xiangxi River watershed, the main runoff contribution came from interflow of the fast store. Although slight differences of overland flow simulations between SLURP and SLURP-TGR were derived, SLURP-TGR was found to help improve the simulation of peak flows, and would improve the overall modeling efficiency through adjusting runoff component simulations. Consequently, the developed modeling approach favors efficient representation of hydrological processes and would be expected to have a potential for wide applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Modeling efficiency; Rainfall intensity; Scale; Surface runoff; Three gorges reservoir; Uncertainty","Arellano-Garcia, H., (2006) Chance Constrained Optimization of Process Systems under Uncertainty, , (Doctor), Technical University of Ilmenau; Armstrong, R.N., Martz, L.W., Effects of reduced land cover detail on hydrological model response (2008) Hydrol.

However, these insect cages can unintentionally alter the climate inside of the cage and impact plant physiology, growth and yield as well as insect populations. This can subsequently affect interpretations of experimental results obtained from caged experiments. To address this concern, we measured meteorological variables in conjunction with soybean physiology, growth, and yield over a two-year period. In a 2011 field study in southern Wisconsin, we compared photosynthetic rates, leaf area index (LAI), soil environmental conditions, and various components of yield for plants grown inside and outside of an industry standard insect cage (Lumite 32. ×. 32 mesh). Inside of cages, several variables were higher (P<. 0.05) including surface (0-6. cm) soil moisture (38%), stomatal conductance (42%), and total plant biomass (30%), while LAI was 20% lower (P<. 0.001) inside of the cages. During the 2012 growing season, we measured wind speed, wind gusts, solar radiation, air temperature and relative humidity inside of cages compared to open field conditions. We found that wind speed and solar radiation were 89% and 42% lower, respectively, and air temperature, relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit were not significantly affected. There was also a significant (P<. 0.0001) effect of the time of day on differences in wind speed and radiation between cages and open field plots. Our findings suggest that commonly used insect cages significantly alter the microclimate inside of the cage, and create a radiation regime in which the amount of direct and diffuse radiation received by plants is altered compared to the open field. Plant physiological processes and growth are affected by these environmental changes, adding a confounding factor when comparing caged to open field plants. Because the effects are likely a function of the type of cage, and mesh size and color, we recommend that future studies more thoroughly measure the microclimate for a variety of common cage types used in experiments. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aphids; Insect exclusion cages; Microclimate; Plant ecology; Plant-insect interactions; Soybean","Alton, P.B., North, P.R., Los, S.O., The impact of diffuse sunlight on canopy light-use efficiency, gross photosynthetic product and net ecosystem exchange in three forest biomes (2007) Global Change Biol., 13 (4), pp. 776-787; Beckendorf, E.A., Catangui, M.A., Riedell, W.E., Soybean aphid feeding injury and soybean yield, yield components, and seed composition (2008) Agron.

Given their strong roles in ecosystem dynamics, documenting the response of bird communities to wildfires is important for improving our understanding and management of post-wildfire ecosystems. However, because wildfires are unplanned events, relatively few studies have been conducted to assess local-scale impacts on forest bird communities. In this study, we had the opportunity to use a before-after, control-impact (BACI) approach to assess the response of resident birds to high severity wildfires that occurred in the Lost Pines ecoregion of Texas in September and October 2011. We replicated a previous study using point count surveys to assess summer and winter bird community changes ca. 1. year after the wildfires. We found that total number of detected individuals did not change following the wildfires, but winter bird species richness increased in burned habitat. Changes were apparent at the foraging guild-level for the winter bird community, with an increase in aerial insectivores and decrease in bark insectivores. Summer and winter bird community composition changes were apparent at the species-level and generally agreed with species-specific habitat preferences. For example, species such as eastern bluebirds and chipping sparrows that prefer open woodlands were positively associated with burned habitat. Our results provide quantitative evidence that high severity forest fires increased habitat suitability for many resident bird species. At the landscape-scale, fire-induced increases in habitat heterogeneity could result in higher bird diversity in the Lost Pines ecoregion. We expect bird community composition will be dynamic in the Lost Pines ecoregion over the next few decades as the burned habitat continues to change through successional processes and post-fire management actions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Fire; Loblolly pine; Lost Pines; Texas","Al-Rabah'ah, M.A., Williams, C.G., An ancient bottleneck in the Lost Pines of central Texas (2004) Mol.

This damage results in a decrease in wheat yields. This study used statistical modeling, three-dimensional (3-D) plots and the Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) to analyze historical wheat yield records in southern New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The aim was to quantify the effects of reproductive stage high-temperature episodes on yields and to compare the predictions of the statistical model with those of APSIM. From the statistical model, it was found that high-degree hours (HDH), a measure of the number of hours that temperatures were above a threshold level during the reproductive stages, always had a negative effect on yields. Furthermore, growing season rainfall, up to approximately 30% above average, had a positive effect. Multi-variable analysis indicated that HDH had the largest negative effect when growing season rainfall was 5-45% below average. In the warmer/drier northwestern shires, there was an average 15% yearly yield reduction due to HDH. Over the whole area, there was an average 5.3% yield reduction for each 1. °C rise in growing season average daily temperature. Averaged across the six shires, high HDH values, which would normally be associated with reproductive system damage, did not affect the accuracy of the APSIM predictions. When the statistical model predictions and the APSIM simulation predictions were tested against a later independent set (1982-2008) of weather data and observed yield records, the predictions of the statistical model (RMSE. =. 14.6) were more accurate than those of APSIM (RMSE. =. 18.9). In conclusion, when suitable climate and yield datasets are available, a combination of statistical modeling and 3-D plots is a useful way to separate the effects of high-temperature episodes and rainfall on wheat yields and identify a rainfall range where high-temperature episodes are most damaging to yields. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","APSIM; Heat stress; High-degree hours; Statistical model; Wheat yields","(2005) Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC), , Electronic Publication; Amthor, J.S., Perspective on the relative insignificance of increasing atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> concentration to crop yield (1998) Field Crops Res., 58, pp. 109-127; Anwar, M.R., O'Leary, G., McNeil, D., Hossain, H., Nelson, R., Climate change impact on rainfed wheat in south-eastern Australia (2007) Field Crops Res., 104 (1-3), pp. 139-147; Asseng, S., Foster, I., Turner, N.C., The impact of temperature variability on wheat yields (2011) Global Change Biol., 17 (2), pp. 997-1012; Barnabas, B., Jager, K., Feher, A., The effect of drought and heat stress on reproductive processes in cereals (2008) Plant Cell Environ., 31 (1), pp. 11-38; Bristow, K.L., Abrecht, D.G., Daily temperature extremes as an indicator of high temperature stress (1991) Aust.

The timing of seed release is consequently critical and for cottonwoods, riparian poplars, seed release has been reported to follow the spring peak in river flow. To investigate the prospective coordination between environmental conditions and seed release we undertook daily observations of black cottonwoods (. Populus trichocarpa) over four summers along the lower Duncan River in southeastern British Columbia, Canada. Seed release involved a sequence of pulses with the first after about 400 cumulative degree days (base 5. °C) in the growth season. There were four or five pulses annually with each extending one to six days and occurring through June and July and unexpectedly, into early August. The pulses of seed release were not coordinated with changes in river flow but all 18 pulses over the four years followed rain events. We thus conclude that in a humid climate mountain ecoregion, rain and possibly post-rain warming may provide environmental cues that trigger cottonwood seed release. This hygrisence could retain the near-mature seeds on the maternal tree, prolonging their viability, and their release after rain would provide moist substrates, benefitting seedling establishment. We further conclude that in a humid ecoregion, the river flow pattern would be less important for riparian seedling colonization than in semi-arid regions, where summer rain is sparse. In all ecoregions, occasional high river flows are essential for the fluvial geomorphic disturbance that creates the barren seedling colonization sites, and also to exclude flood-intolerant upland vegetation from encroaching into the riparian recruitment zones. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Phenology; Populus; Riparian; River","Baskin, C.C., Baskin, J.M., (2001) Seeds: Ecology Biogeography, and Evolution of Dormancy and Germination, , Elsevier; Berg, K., Samuelson, G., Willms, C., Pearce, D., Rood, S., Consistent growth of black cottonwoods despite temperature variation across elevational ecoregions in the Rocky Mountains (2007) Trees, 21, pp. 161-169; Böhlenius, H., Huang, T., Charbonnel-Campaa, L., Brunner, A.M., Jansson, S., Strauss, S.H., Nilsson, O., CO/FT regulatory module controls timing of flowering and seasonal growth cessation in trees (2006) Science, 312, pp. 1040-1043; Campbell, J.T., Why certain kinds of timber prevail in certain localities (1885) Am.

Sixty-three FLMs from two French nuclear plants answered a questionnaire measuring perceived workplace safety climate, perceived risk, and involvement in safety management. We hypothesized that a positive perception of safety climate would promote substantial involvement in safety management, and that this effect would be stronger than the perceived-risk effect. We also expected that safety climate dimensions would have a different impact on involvement in safety management. Especially, we expected climate dimensions dealing with safety-related exchanges between managers and their supervisees to be more related to FLMs' involvement in safety management. As expected, perceived risk, as well as safety climate, was related to FLMs' involvement in safety management: the more they perceived risks as probable and serious for their supervisees, the more involved they got in safety management. Similarly, FLMs who perceived a good safety climate in their company reported getting more involved in safety management than did FLMs who perceived a poor safety climate. Moreover, the results showed that safety climate was the key variable because it completely mediated the effect of perceived risk on involvement in safety management. Another important result showed that immediate supervisor encouragement was more influential than senior management views on safety. Furthermore, the fact of being called upon by supervisees on safety issues prompted the FLMs to be more involved in safety management. Possible avenues for improving the involvement of FLMs in safety management are suggested. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Front-line manager; Involvement in safety management; Risk perception; Safety climate; Supervisor-supervisees social exchange","Ajzen, I., Nature and operation of attitudes (2001) Annu.

However, islands also feature a high degree of resilience through resources from dense social networks, such as collective action, norms of reciprocity, and relations of trust. Therefore, we argue that these resources - generally defined as social capital - are particularly relevant for climate change adaptation on small islands.Current research on the role of social capital for communities covers many different aspects, such as local knowledge, economic development, and political capacity. But effective adaptation relies on understanding the role of social capital for these aspects in connection to the specific impacts of climate change - a holistic approach is needed.Based on empirical case studies we developed an analytical framework that provides a step-by-step approach to help analyse the potential of social capital for the adaptation to climate change in island-specific case studies. These steps, among others, include an assessment of social capital, hazard mapping, and the analysis of political and economic capacity. Moreover, the framework suggests methods on how to analyse these steps. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive capacity; Climate change adaptation; Resilience; Small islands; Social capital","Adger, W.N., (2001) Social Capital and Climate Change, , Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, (Working Papers, 8); Adger, W.N., Social capital, collective action, and adaptation to climate change (2003) Econ.

Disturbances have altered and reduced this ecosystem historically, but climate change may ultimately represent the greatest future risk. Improved ways to quantify, monitor, and predict climate-driven gradual change in this ecosystem is vital to its future management. We examined the annual change of Daymet precipitation (daily gridded climate data) and five remote sensing ecosystem sagebrush vegetation and soil components (bare ground, herbaceous, litter, sagebrush, and shrub) from 1984 to 2011 in southwestern Wyoming. Bare ground displayed an increasing trend in abundance over time, and herbaceous, litter, shrub, and sagebrush showed a decreasing trend. Total precipitation amounts show a downward trend during the same period. We established statistically significant correlations between each sagebrush component and historical precipitation records using a simple least squares linear regression. Using the historical relationship between sagebrush component abundance and precipitation in a linear model, we forecasted the abundance of the sagebrush components in 2050 using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) precipitation scenarios A1B and A2. Bare ground was the only component that increased under both future scenarios, with a net increase of 48.98 km2 (1.1%) across the study area under the A1B scenario and 41.15 km2 (0.9%) under the A2 scenario. The remaining components decreased under both future scenarios: litter had the highest net reductions with 49.82 km2 (4.1%) under A1B and 50.8 km2 (4.2%) under A2, and herbaceous had the smallest net reductions with 39.95 km2 (3.8%) under A1B and 40.59 km2 (3.3%) under A2. We applied the 2050 forecast sagebrush component values to contemporary (circa 2006) greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat models to evaluate the effects of potential climate-induced habitat change. Under the 2050 IPCC A1B scenario, 11.6% of currently identified nesting habitat was lost, and 0.002% of new potential habitat was gained, with 4% of summer habitat lost and 0.039% gained. Our results demonstrate the successful ability of remote sensing based sagebrush components, when coupled with precipitation, to forecast future component response using IPCC precipitation scenarios. Our approach also enables future quantification of greater sage-grouse habitat under different precipitation scenarios, and provides additional capability to identify regional precipitation influence on sagebrush component response.","Climate forecasting; Remote sensing; Sage grouse; Sagebrush ecosystem; Trend analysis","Aldridge, C.L., Nielsen, S.E., Beyer, H.L., Boyce, M.S., Connelly, J.W., Knick, S.T., Schroeder, M.A., Range-wide patterns of greater sage-grouse persistence (2008) Divers.

A vulnerability assessment is performed in the state of Georgia (United States) at the county level from 1975 to 2012 in decadal increments. Climate change vulnerability is typically measured as a function of exposure to physical phenomena (e.g., droughts, floods), sensitivity to factors affecting the social milieu, and the capacity of a given unit to adapt to changing physical conditions. The paper builds on previous assessments and offers a unique approach to vulnerability analyses by combining climatic, social, land cover, and hydrological components together into a unified vulnerability assessment, which captures both long-term and hydroclimatic events. Climate change vulnerability indices are derived for the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. Climate change exposure is measured as: 1) departure of decadal mean temperature and precipitation from baseline temperature and precipitation (1971-2000) using the United States Historical Climatology Network version 2.5 and 2) extreme hydroclimatic hazards indicated by flood, heat wave and drought events. Sensitivity and adaptive capacity are measured by well-established conceptualizations and methods built derived from socioeconomic variables. Impervious surface and flood susceptibility area are also incorporated to account for place-based vulnerability.Anomalies in temperature and precipitation with an overall trend towards drying and warming have been observed. The anomalous cooling period in Georgia during the 1970-1980 period as well as the post-1980 warm-up have been captured with a clearly established increase in extreme hydroclimatic events in recent decades. Climate vulnerability is highest in some metropolitan Atlanta and coastal counties. However, the southwestern region of Georgia, and part of the rural Black belt region are found to be especially vulnerable to climate change. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Biophysical and social vulnerabilities; Climate change; Climate extremes; Georgia","Adger, W.N., Social vulnerability to climate change and extremes in coastal Vietnam (1999) World Development, 27, pp. 249-269; Adger, W.N., Vincent, K., Uncertainty in adaptive capacity (2005) Comptes Rendus Geoscience, 337, pp. 399-410; Allison, E.H., Perry, A.L., Badjeck, M.C., Adger, W.N., Brown, K., Conway, D., Vulnerability of national economies to the impacts of climate change on fisheries (2009) Fish and Fisheries, 10, pp. 173-196; Ambinakudige, S., Parisi, D., Grice, S.M., An analysis of differential migration patterns in the Black belt and the New South (2012) Southeastern Geographer, 52, pp. 146-163; Andersen, T., Shepherd, J.M., Floods in a changing climate (2013) Geography Compass, 7, pp. 95-115; Arcury, T.A., Marín, A.J., Latino/Hispanic farmworkers and farm work in the Eastern United States: the context for health, safety, and justice (2009) Latino farmworkers in the Eastern United States, pp. 15-36. , Springer, New York, S.A.

Non-stationarities in large-scale modes of climate variability of the Northern Hemisphere and the associated changes in the surface climate like modifications of the temperature and precipitation patterns are analysed. As major modes of climate variability the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon, the Pacific-North American pattern and the North Atlantic Oscillation are selected. The North Atlantic-European area is taken as an example to highlight non-stationarities in the atmospheric circulation and their impact on regional climate. The mechanisms and consequences of circulation-climate non-stationarities are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Circulation types; Climate variability; European area; Large-scale modes of variability; Non-stationarities; Northern hemisphere","Álvarez-García, F.J., OrtizBevia, M.J., CabosNarvaez, W.D., On the structure and teleconnections of North Atlantic decadal variability (2011) J.

We evaluate the linkages between vulnerability indicators by relating a community perceptions with observed and projected climate change scenarios. In evaluating these linkages, some key questions are considered such as: what are the likely socio-economic drivers contributing to community's sensitivity? Are these drivers impacting the community and how much is the community's coping potential to climate change? What are the key adaptation options necessary for increasing the community's resilience? This study is carried out in a coastal town (Keti Bandar), which is located in the Indus delta. This region is highly sensitive to declining fresh water flows, changing climate and meager socio-economic resources of local population. We have used the Composite Vulnerability Index (CVI) approach in order to draw a general picture of the community's vulnerability under a changing climate in Keti Bandar. The data for three CVI components (exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity) are collected at household level through questionnaire-based survey in six villages, however for exposure, secondary data is also acquired. Our assessment shows that these coastal communities, either engaged with the fishery or agriculture sector, are not only exposed, but are also highly sensitive to climate change driven threats. Moreover, lack of access to basic facilities, inadequate income diversification, and low education levels are negatively affecting the adaptive capacity of the entire local population. However, the communities' nature of dwelling, their strong family networks, and their ability to migrate contribute positively to their adaptive capacity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive capacity; Composite Vulnerability Index; Exposure; Indus Delta; Sensitivity","Abbas, S., Faisal, M.Q., Ghaffar, A., Nitin, K.T., Khurram, S., Rashid, S., Hammad, G., An assessment of status and distribution of mangrove forest cover in Pakistan (2013) J.Bio.

In this study, we combined predictive habitat models with a downscaled climate model to examine potential impacts on adults and larvae of Atlantic bluefin tuna (. Thunnus thynnus) and skipjack tuna (. Katsuwonus pelamis) in the Intra-Americas Sea (IAS). An additional downscaled model covering the 20th century was used to compare habitat fluctuations from natural variability to predicted future changes under two climate change scenarios: Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 (medium-low) and RCP 8.5 (high). Results showed marked temperature-induced habitat losses for both adult and larval bluefin tuna on their northern Gulf of Mexico spawning grounds. In contrast, habitat suitability for skipjack tuna increased as temperatures warmed. Model error was highest for the two skipjack tuna models, particularly at higher temperatures. This work suggests that influences of climate change on highly migratory Atlantic tuna species are likely to be substantial, but strongly species-specific. While impacts on fish populations remain uncertain, these changes in habitat suitability will likely alter the spatial and temporal availability of species to fishing fleets, and challenge equilibrium assumptions of environmental stability, upon which fisheries management benchmarks are based. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Atlantic bluefin tuna; Climate changes; Habitat; Niches; Skipjack tuna; Tuna fisheries","Barkley, R.A., Neill, W.H., Gooding, R.M., Skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis, habitat based on temperature and oxygen requirements (1978) Fish.

The simulated volume transport by the western boundary current system in the IAS, including the Caribbean Current, Yucatan Current and Loop Current (LC), is reduced by 20-25% during the 21st century, consistent with a similar rate of reduction in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The effect of the LC in the present climate is to warm the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Therefore, the reduced LC and the associated weakening of the warm transient LC eddies have a cooling impact in the GoM, particularly during boreal spring in the northern deep basin, in agreement with an earlier dynamic downscaling study. In contrast to the reduced warming in the northern deep GoM, the downscaled model predicts an intense warming in the shallow (≤. 200. m) northeastern shelf of the GoM especially during boreal summer since there is no effective mechanism to dissipate the increased surface heating. Potential implications of the regionally distinctive warming trend pattern in the GoM on the marine ecosystems and hurricane intensifications during landfall are discussed. This study also explores the effects of 20th century warming and climate variability in the IAS using the regional ocean model forced with observed surface flux fields. The main modes of sea surface temperature variability in the IAS are linked to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and a meridional dipole pattern between the GoM and Caribbean Sea. It is also shown that variability of the IAS western boundary current system in the 20th century is largely driven by wind stress curl in the Sverdrup interior and the AMOC. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","AMO; AMOC; Caribbean current; Caribbean Sea; Climate change; Dynamical downscaling; Global warming; Gulf of Mexico; Intra-Americas Sea; Loop current","Alexander, M., Scott, J., The influence of ENSO on air-sea interaction in the Atlantic (2002) Geophys.

Changes in the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation alter the structures and functions of the landscape, thereby affecting ecological processes. Hilly southern China is an important ecological restoration area, in which the vegetation cover and land use has changed significantly. However, very few studies have considered vegetation changes due to multiple factors in this region. We investigated the spatiotemporal variations in vegetation cover using a Normal Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data set obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and climate data from 2000 to 2010. Our results indicate that the NDVI during the growing season had increased by 0.03% during the 11-year period. Patterns of change in vegetation cover differed among locations, with 58.7% of the study area displaying increased NDVI values, and in 7.3% of the study area, within an ecological restoration zone, the increase was significant. Effective ecological restoration programs, such as Grain for Green and hill closure for afforestation, have improved the environmental conditions. The spatiotemporal variations in vegetation cover were likely to be a synergistic impact of climate change (fluctuations in temperature and precipitation) and human activities. A residual analysis of the changes in the NDVI indicated that human activities had either improved or degraded vegetation cover in some parts of southern China. Specifically, the negative effects of extreme weather events in 2009 and 2010 offset the positive benefits of ecological reconstruction programs in the western part of the study area. This indicates that extreme weather events should be considered in the design and planning of future ecological reconstruction. Drought-resistant plant species might be considered for future ecological projects. However, an eco-risk assessment should be conducted when introducing drought-resistant plant species. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate fluctuation; Ecological projects; MODIS; NDVI; Residual analysis; Vegetation cover","Cai, H.Y., Yang, X.H., Wang, K.J., Xiao, L.L., Is forest restoration in the southwest China karst promoted mainly by climate change or human-induced factors?

This study simulated the impact of climate change on the runoff generation and streamflow of Chu River Basin (CRB), a glacierized basin in Central Asia using the enhanced Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The model was calibrated and validated using the measured monthly streamflow data from three discharge gauge stations in CRB for the period 1961–1985 and was subsequently driven by downscaled future climate projections of five Global Circulation Models (GCMs) in Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under three radiative forcing scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). In this study, the period 1966–1995 was used as the baseline period, while 2016–2045 and 2066–2095 as the near-future and far-future period, respectively. As projected, the climate would become warmer and drier under all scenarios in the future, and the future climate would be characterized by larger seasonal and annual variations under higher RCP. A general decreasing trend was identified in the average annual runoff in glacier (−26.6% to −1.0%), snow (−21.4% to +1.1%) and streamflow (−27.7% to −6.6%) for most of the future scenario periods. The projected maximum streamflow in each of the two future scenarios occurred one month earlier than that in the baseline period because of the reduced streamflow in summer months. Results of this study are expected to arouse the serious concern about water resource availability in the headwater region of CRB under the continuously warming climate. Changes in simulated hydrologic outputs underscored the significance of lowering the uncertainties in temperature and precipitation projection. © 2015, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer - Verlag GmbH.","climate change; glacier; hydrologic modeling; meltwater runoff; snow","Aizen, V.B., Aizen, E.M., Melack, J.M., Climatic and hydrologic changes in the Tien Shan, Central Asia (1997) Journal of Climate, 10, pp. 1393-1404; Aizen, V.B., Kuzmichenok, V.A., Surazakov, A.B., Glacier changes in the Tien Shan as determined from topographic and remotely sensed data (2007) Global and Planetary Change, 56 (3-4), pp. 328-340; Anandhi, A., Frei, A., Pierson, D.C., Examination of change factor methodologies for climate change impact assessment (2011) Water Resources Research, 47 (3), p.

Spatially explicit models that simulate ecosystem dynamics at fine (plant, stand) to coarse (regional, global) scales are indispensable tools for meeting this challenge under a variety of possible futures. A special class of these models, called landscape models (LMs), simulates dynamics at intermediate scales where many critical ecosystem processes interact. The complicated dependencies among climate, disturbance, and vegetation present a difficult challenge for LMs, however, because their simulation must reconcile processes and their interactions that occur at different spatial and temporal scales. In the absence of these interactions, key thresholds in ecosystem responses to changes in climate may go undetected or misrepresented. In this paper, we present a general strategy for constructing the next generation of LMs that ensures that interactions are modeled at appropriate scales of time and space, and that, when possible, processes representing these interactions are simulated mechanistically. We identify six key questions to frame this strategy and then provide guidance and possible solutions on the structure and content needed in future LMs to ensure that climate-vegetation-disturbance interactions are incorporated effectively. © 2015.","Disturbance; Global change; Interactions; Landscape ecology; Landscape modeling; Scale","Agee, J.K., The landscape ecology of western forest fire regimes (1998) Northwest Sci., 72, pp. 24-34; Abatzoglou, J.T., Brown, T.J., A comparison of statistical downscaling methods suited for wildfire applications (2012) Int.

We also developed a conceptual model describing and analyzing the impacts of climate change on nitrogen enrichment. These two models were conducted in Miyun Reservoir to analyze the contribution of climate change to the variations in sediment nitrogen sources based on two 210Pb and 137Cs dated sediment cores. The results showed that during the past 50years, average contributions of soil and fertilizer, submerged macrophytes, N<inf>2</inf>-fixing phytoplankton, and non-N<inf>2</inf>-fixing phytoplankton were 40.7%, 40.3%, 11.8%, and 7.2%, respectively. In addition, total nitrogen (TN) contents in sediment showed significant increasing trends from 1960 to 2010, and sediment nitrogen of both submerged macrophytes and phytoplankton sources exhibited significant increasing trends during the past 50years. In contrast, soil and fertilizer sources showed a significant decreasing trend from 1990 to 2010. According to the changing trend of N<inf>2</inf>-fixing phytoplankton, changes of temperature and sunshine duration accounted for at least 43% of the trend in the sediment nitrogen enrichment over the past 50years. Regression analysis of the climatic factors on nitrogen sources showed that the contributions of precipitation, temperature, and sunshine duration to the variations in sediment nitrogen sources ranged from 18.5% to 60.3%. The study demonstrates that the mixing model provides a robust method for calculating the contribution of multiple nitrogen sources in sediment, and this study also suggests that N<inf>2</inf>-fixing phytoplankton could be regarded as an important response factor for assessing the impacts of climate change on nitrogen enrichment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Mixing model; N<inf>2</inf>-fixing phytoplankton; Nitrogen; Sediment; δ13C and δ15N","Altabet, M.A., Pilskaln, C., Thunell, R., Pride, C., Sigman, D., Chavez, F., Francois, R., The nitrogen isotope biogeochemistry of sinking particles from the margin of the Eastern North Pacific (1999) Deep-Sea Res.

There has been little examination of how these curves change over space and time. We evaluated the short-term effects of hot and cold temperatures on daily mortality over six 7-year periods in 211 US cities, comprising over 42 million deaths. Cluster analysis was used to group the cities according to similar temperatures and relative humidity. Temperature-mortality functions were calculated using B-splines to model the heat effect (lag 0) and the cold effect on mortality (moving average lags 1-5). The functions were then combined through meta-smoothing and subsequently analyzed by meta-regression. We identified eight clusters. At lag 0, Cluster 5 (West Coast) had a RR of 1.14 (95% CI: 1.11,1.17) for temperatures of 27. °C vs 15.6. °C, and Cluster 6 (Gulf Coast) has a RR of 1.04 (95% CI: 1.03,1.05), suggesting that people are acclimated to their respective climates. Controlling for cluster effect in the multivariate-meta regression we found that across the US, the excess mortality from a 24-h temperature of 27. °C decreased over time from 10.6% to 0.9%. We found that the overall risk due to the heat effect is significantly affected by summer temperature mean and air condition usage, which could be a potential predictor in building climate-change scenarios. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Health effects; Meta-smoothing; Temperature","Analitis, A., Katsouyanni, K., Biggeri, A., Baccini, M., Forsberg, B., Bisanti, L., Kirchmayer, U., Goodman, P., Effects of cold weather on mortality: results from 15 European cities within the PHEWE project (2008) Am.

Climate variability and change beyond a few years to a few decades ahead have significant social, economic, and environmental implications. It is believed that some aspects of this decadal variability could be predictable for a decade or longer in advance. Keeping this in mind, phase five of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), for the first time, provides 10-30. years predictions obtained from the General Circulation Models (GCMs).This study aims to analyse the CMIP5 decadal predictions for precipitation over five sub-basins of river Brahmaputra. Daily precipitation data of five GCMs, namely F-GOALS-g2, BCC-CSM1-1, IPSL-CM5A, CanCM4 and MRI-CGCM3 are used for this assessment. Empirical relationships between the basin averaged rainfall wet spell (storm) properties and the characteristics of the floods are formulated for storms which lead to significant short-term flood response. Following this, the changes in the flood behaviour in the future are derived on the basis of changes in the characteristics of wet rainfall spells in 2010-2020. The results suggest an increase in the number of spells with higher rainfall and longer duration which can lead to increase in peak flood and the total flood volume. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","CMIP5; Cumulative distribution functions (CDFs); Decadal predictions; Floods; Quantile-quantile transform; Rainfall spells","http://www.chikyu.ac.jp/precipBeven, K.J., Binley, A.M., The future of distributed models - model calibration and uncertainty prediction (1992) Hydrol.

This paper presents a framework for adjusting optimal water protection in the long term when the true trend in nutrient loading is unknown to the decision maker but can be gradually learned by monitoring stochastic nutrient loads. The economic impacts of an unknown trend consist of (i) the damage caused by the worsened state of the sea, (ii) the cost of nutrient abatement to counter the development and (iii) the adjustment costs caused by uncertainty and imperfect learning. An integrated assessment model is designed and calibrated for quantitative results pertaining to the uncertain impacts of climate change on nutrient input to the Baltic Sea. Under certainty, the net economic impacts from the currently anticipated climate change are 15.0 billion euros, of which 23% comes from welfare losses caused by aggravated eutrophication and 77% from increased abatement costs. The expected adjustment costs due to uncertain future development range from 90 million euros in the case of adaptive management based on Bayesian learning to as much as 7960 million euros in the case of an extreme variant of inadaptive management based on constant abatement levels. If adaptive management is adopted, there is no need to account for future climate change when planning the current abatement targets. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive management; Bayesian learning; Climate change; Dynamic programming; Eutrophication; Integrated assessment model; Non-linear system dynamics; Shallow lake model; Uncertainty","Ahlvik, L., Pavlova, Y., A strategic analysis of eutrophication abatement in the Baltic Sea (2013) Environ.

This is partly due to inter-specific variance in the physiological traits which mediate environmental temperature effects at the organismal level. We examined variation in the critical thermal minimum (CT<inf>min</inf>), critical thermal maximum (CT<inf>max</inf>) and evaporative water loss rates (EWL) of a widespread lowland (Niveoscincus ocellatus) and two range restricted highland (N. microlepidotus andN. greeni) members of a cool temperate Tasmanian lizard genus. The widespread lowland species had significantly higher CT<inf>min</inf> and CT<inf>max</inf> and significantly lower EWL than both highland species. Implications of inter-specific variation in thermal tolerance for activity were examined under contemporary and future climate change scenarios. Instances of air temperatures below CT<inf>min</inf> were predicted to decline in frequency for the widespread lowland and both highland species. Air temperatures of high altitude sites were not predicted to exceed the CT<inf>max</inf> of either highland species throughout the 21st century. In contrast, the widespread lowland species is predicted to experience air temperatures in excess of CT<inf>max</inf> on 1 or 2 days by three of six global circulation models from 2068-2096. To estimate climate change effects on activity we reran the thermal tolerance models using minimum and maximum temperatures selected for activity. A net gain in available activity time was predicted under climate change for all three species; while air temperatures were predicted to exceed maximum temperatures selected for activity with increasing frequency, the change was not as great as the predicted decline in air temperatures below minimum temperatures selected for activity. We hypothesise that the major effect of rising air temperatures under climate change is an increase in available activity period for both the widespread lowland and highland species. The consequences of a greater available activity period will depend on the extent to which changes in climate alters other related factors, such as the nature and level of competition between the respective species. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Alpine species; Climate change; Critical thermal limit; Evaporative water loss; Reptile; Squamate","Alibardi, L., Adaptation to the land: the skin of reptiles in comparison to that of amphibians and endotherm amniotes (2003) J.

The modern climate ranges of the taxa are obtained (1) from county-level presence/absence data and (2) from data on the optimum and range of each taxon from Lu et al. (2011). The CoA based on the optimum and range data yields better predictions of observed climate parameters at the pollen sites than that based on the county-level data. The presence of arboreal pollen, most of which is derived from outside the region, distorts the reconstructions. More reliable reconstructions are obtained using only the non-arboreal component of the pollen assemblages. The root mean-squared error (RMSE) of the MAP reconstructions are smaller than the RMSE of MAT, MTWA and MTCO, suggesting that precipitation gradients are the most important control of vegetation distribution on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Our results show that CoA could be used to reconstruct past climates in this region, although in areas characterized by open vegetation the most reliable estimates will be obtained by excluding possible arboreal contaminants. © 2015 .","Arboreal pollen; Climate reconstruction; Coexistence Approach; Mean annual precipitation; Pollen surface sample; Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau","Atkinson, T.C., Briffa, K.R., Coope, G.R., Seasonal temperatures in Britain during the last 22,000years, reconstructed using beetle remains (1987) Nature, 325, pp. 587-593; Bartlein, P.J., Harrison, S.P., Brewer, S., Connor, S., Davis, B.A.S., Gajewski, K., Guiot, J., Wu, H., Pollen-based continental climate reconstructions at 6 and 21ka: a global synthesis (2011) Clim.

These types of shades can keep inside temperatures cooler and consequently reduce cooling loads and costs. This study employs Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to compare the effects of three different shading materials on building energy consumption and their impacts to the environment within five major climate zones defined by American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). To achieve this objective, A Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) is used to quantify the energy and emissions of the exterior shading systems during the manufacturing process, in-service and end of life. The Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability (BEES) model and SimaPro 8.0 software (Ecoinvent 3.0 database) were employed to develop the life cycle inventory of the shadings through all life cycle stages. The LCA framework used in this study was based on a life cycle methodology that follows the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14040 standard for Life Cycle Assessment and the ASTM standard for Multi-Attribute Decision Analysis. Based on the analysis conducted for wood, aluminum, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) shadings, it may be concluded that the use of external shadings on residential window panes, in most cases, carries a positive effect on fossil fuel depletion impact, while it increases environmental loads in other environmental impact categories. Among the three aforementioned materials, wood and PVC shadings are the most and the least environmentally-friendly materials, respectively. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate zones; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Life cycle cost (LCC); Multi-attribute decision analysis; Solar shading system; Sustainable building material","Stazi, F., Mastrucci, A., Munafò, P., Life cycle assessment approach for the optimization of sustainable building envelopes: an application on solar wall systems (2012) Build Environ, 58, pp. 278-288; Mora, R., Bitsuamlak, G., Horvat, M., Integrated life-cycle design of building enclosures (2011) Build Environ, 46, pp. 1469-1479; Babaizadeh, H., Hassan, M., Life cycle assessment of nano-sized titanium dioxide coating on residential windows (2013) Constr Build Mater, 40, pp. 314-321; Abeysundra, U.G.Y., Babel, S., Gheewala, S., Sharp, A., Environmental, economic and social analysis of materials for doors and windows in Sri Lanka (2007) Build Environ, 42, pp. 2141-2149; Broun, R., Babaizadeh, H., Zakersalehi, A., Menzies, G.F., Integrated life cycle energy and greenhouse gas analysis of exterior wall systems for residential buildings (2014) Sustainability, 6, pp. 8592-8603; Kosareo, L., Robert, R., Comparative environmental life cycle assessment of green roofs (2007) Build Environ, 42, pp. 2606-2613; Bribián, I.Z., Aranda, U., Scarpellini, S., Life cycle assessment in buildings: state-of-the-art and simplified LCA methodology as a complement for building certification (2009) Build Environ, 44, pp. 2510-2520; Nibel, S.L.T., Knapen, M., Boonstra, C., Moffat, S., Annex 31: energy related environmental impact of buildings International Energy AgencyErlandsson, M., Borg, M., Generic LCA - methodology applicable for buildings, constructions and operation services - today practice and development needs (2003) Build Environ, 38, pp. 919-938; Fesanghary, M., Asadi, S., Geem, Z.W., Design of low-emission and energy-efficient residential buildings using a multi-objective optimization algorithm (2012) Build Environ, 49, pp. 245-250; Somayeh Asadi, Z.W.G., Sustainable building design: a review on recent metaheuristic methods (2015) Recent advances in swarm intelligence and evolutionary computation, pp. 203-223. , Springer International Publishing; Somayeh Asadi, S.S.A., Mottahedi, M., On the development of multi-linear regression analysis to assess energy consumption in the early stages of building design (2014) Energy Build, 85, pp. 246-255; Asadi, S., Geem, Z.M., Sustainable building design: a review on recent metaheuristic methods (2015) Recent advances in swarm intelligence and evolutionary computation studies in computational intelligence, pp. 203-223. , Publishing S.I.

The stationarity assumption of extreme events for conducting hydrological frequency analysis to estimate return period and risk is now problematic due to climate change. Two different interpretations of return period, i.e. the expected waiting time (EWT) and expected number of exceedances (ENE), have already been proposed in literature to consider nonstationarity in return period and risk analysis by introducing the time-varying moment method into frequency analysis, under the assumption that the statistical parameters are functions only of time. This paper aimed at improving the characterization of nonstationary return period and risk under the ENE interpretation by employing meteorological covariates in the nonstationary frequency analysis. The advantage of the method is that the downscaled meteorological variables from the General Circulation Models (GCMs) can be used to calculate the nonstationary statistical parameters and exceedance probabilities for future years and thus the corresponding return period and risk. The traditional approach using time as the only covariate under both the EWT and ENE interpretations was also applied for comparison. Both approaches were applied to annual minimum monthly streamflow series of two stations in the Wei River, China, and gave estimates of nonstationary return period and risk that were significantly different from the stationary case. The nonstationary return period and risk under the ENE interpretation using meteorological covariates were found more reasonable and advisable than those of the EWT and ENE cases using time alone as covariate. It is concluded that return period and risk analysis of nonstationary low-flow series can be helpful to water resources management during dry seasons exacerbated by climate change. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","General Circulation Models (GCMs); Low-flow; Nonstationarity; Return period; Risk","Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE Trans.

The effects of frozen lake surfaces on terrigenous sediment deposition and how climate changes on the Tibetan Plateau are reflected in these lakes, however, is seldom discussed. A lake sediment core from Hala Lake (590km2), northeastern Tibetan Plateau spanning the time interval from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present was investigated using high-resolution grain-size composition of lacustrine deposits. Seismic analysis along a north-south profile across the lake was used to infer the sedimentary setting within the lake basin. Periods of freezing and melting processes on the lake surface were identified by MODIS (MOD10A1) satellite data. End-member modeling of the grain size distribution allowed the discrimination between lacustrine, eolian and fluvial sediments. The dominant clay sedimentation (slack water type) during the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) reflects ice interceptions in long cold periods, in contrast to abundant eolian input during abrupt cold events. Therefore, fluvial and slack water sedimentation processes can indicate changes in the local paleoclimate during periods of the lake being frozen, when eolian input was minor. Inferred warm (i.e., ~22.7 and 19.5cal.ka BP) and cold (i.e., ~11-9 and 3-1.5cal.ka BP) spells have significant environmental impacts, not only in the regional realm, but they are also coherent with global-scale climate events. The eolian input generally follows the trend of the mid-latitude westerly wind dynamics in winter, contributing medium-sized sand to the lake center, deposited within the ice cover during icing and melting phases. Enhanced input was dominant during the Younger Dryas, Heinrich Event 1 and at around 8.2ka, equivalent to the well-known events of the North Atlantic realm. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","End-member modeling; Grain size; Lake deposits; Pleistocene and Holocene climate; Tibetan Plateau","An, Z., Stephen, C.P., Zhou, W., Lu, Y., Douglas, J.D., Head, M.J., Wu, X., Zheng, H., Episode of strengthened summer monsoon climate of younger Dryas Age on the Loess Plateau of Central China (1993) Quatern.

We examine changes in wildland fire patterns based on the U.S. Forest Service's MC1 dynamic global vegetation model from 2013 to 2115 under two pre-defined scenarios: a reference (i.e., business-as-usual) and a greenhouse gas mitigation policy scenario. We construct a habitat equivalency model under which fuels management activities, actions commonly undertaken to reduce the frequency and/or severity of wildland fire, are used to compensate for climate change-induced losses in ecosystem services on conservation lands in the contiguous U.S. resulting from wildland fire. The benefit of the greenhouse gas mitigation policy is equal to the difference in fuels management costs between the reference and policy scenarios. Results suggest present value ecosystem service benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation on the average of $3.5 billion (2005 dollars, assuming a three percent discount rate). Our analysis highlights the importance of considering loss of ecosystem services when evaluating the impacts of alternative greenhouse gas mitigation policies. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Economics; Ecosystem services; Fire","Agee, J.K., Skinner, C.N., Basic principles of forest fuel reduction treatments (2005) For.

Ltd., Hebei, China","Heating accounts for a large proportion of energy consumption in residential buildings located in cold climate. Solar energy plays an important role in responding to the growing demand of energy as well as dealing with pressing climate change and air pollution issues. Solar energy is featured with low-density and intermittency, therefore an appropriate storage method is required. This paper reports a critical review of existing studies on thermal storage systems that employ various methods. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCMs) is one of the most effective methods to store thermal energy, and it can significantly reduce area for solar collector. During the application of PCM, the solid-liquid phase change can be used to store a large quantity of energy where the selection of the PCM is most critical. A numerical study is presented in this study to explore the effectiveness of NH<inf>4</inf>Al(SO<inf>4</inf>)<inf>2</inf>·12H<inf>2</inf>O as a new inorganic phase change material (PCM). Its characteristics and heat transfer patterns were studied by means of both experiment and simulation. The results show that heat absorption and storage are more efficient when temperature of heat source is 26.5 °C greater than the phase transition temperature. According to heat transfer characteristics at both radial and axial directions, it is suggested to set up some small exchangers so that solar energy can be stored unit by unit in practice. Such system is more effective in low density residential buildings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This is particularly limiting for highly glacierized watersheds. The limitation has been corrected by a further refinement of the method. The results with the refined procedure are highly consistent with the physical characteristics such as hypsometry and glacier extents of the watershed even though the method itself is completely independent of the physical characteristics of the watershed where it is applied. Glacial melt far outweigh snowmelt in the rivers draining the Karakoram and Zanskar ranges. In the Karakoram, on an annualized basis, glacial melt proportion varies from 43% to 50% whereas snowmelt varies from 27% to 31%. On the other hand, snowmelt dominates over glacial melt in the rivers draining the western Greater Himalayas and the Hindu Kush. Here snowmelt percentage in river discharge varies from 31% to 53% whereas that of glacial melt ranges from 16% to 30%. In the main stem of Upper Indus River, snowmelt fraction in most cases is slightly greater than the glacial melt fraction. In the main stem, snowmelt percentage ranges from 35% to 44% whereas glacial melt percentage ranges from 25% to 36%. Upper Indus River just upstream of Tarbela Reservoir carries annual flows constituted of 70% melt water of which 26% is contributed by glacial melts and 44% by snowmelts. We also show that during the later part of twentieth century and continuing into the early part of twenty first century glacial melt contributions to river discharge has decreased compared to the previous decades. This phenomenon can be ascribed to either basin wide loss of glacial mass in the recent decades in the elevation range from where most of the glacial melt originates or glacier growth and stability due to either reduction in energy inputs or increase in precipitation or both at the high altitude bands wherefrom glacial melt water originates. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Glacial melt; Hydrologic flow regime; Seasonal snowmelt; Upper indus basin","Archer, D., Hydrological implications of spatial and altitudinal variation in temperature in the Upper Indus Basin (2004) Nord.

We empirically investigate how the amount of discretionary time that individuals have at their disposal influences both what type of sustainable consumption practices they adopt and the size of this value-action gap. We contend that discretionary time has a twofold effect. Given fixed preferences, time-poor individuals tend to satisfy their preferences by adopting sustainable consumption practices that require relatively less time. Moreover, a lack of discretionary time also inhibits agents from developing preferences that actually reflect their underlying environmental concerns. Our findings support both of these hypotheses and suggest that increasing discretionary time is associated with significant reductions in the value-action gap. This suggest that policies which increase discretionary time, such as measures to improve the work-life balance, may thus help in fostering the emergence of pro-environmental preferences among consumers in the long run. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Discretionary time; Sustainable consumption practices; Value-action gap","Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organ.

This assumption encouraged us to comparatively evaluate the accumulation potential of ryegrass cv. Lema and guava cv. Paluma macro and micronutrients. We also indicated the most appropriate species for biomonitoring nutrient contamination risks in tropical areas of Southeastern Brazil, which are characterized by marked dry and wet seasons and complex mixtures of air pollutants from different sources (industries, vehicle traffic and agriculture). The study was conducted in 14 sites with different neighboring land uses, within the Metropolitan Region of Campinas, central-eastern region of São Paulo State. The exposure experiments with ryegrass and guava were consecutively repeated 40 (28 days each) and 12 (84 days each) times, respectively, from Oct/2010 to Sept/2013. Macro and micronutrients were analyzed and background concentrations and enrichment ratios (. ER) were estimated to classify the contamination risk within the study region. Significantly higher ER suggested that ryegrass were the most appropriate accumulator species for N, S, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn deposition and guava for K, Ca, P and B deposition. Based on these biomonitoring adjustments, we concluded that the nutrient deposition was spatially homogeneous in the study area, but clear seasonality in the contamination risk by nutritional inputs was evidenced. Significantly higher contamination risk by S, Fe, K and B occurred during the dry season and enhanced contamination risk by Mn, Cu and Zn were highlighted during the wet season. Distinctly high contamination risk was estimated for S, Fe and Mn in several exposure experiments. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Biomonitoring; Contamination risk; Lolium multiflorum; Nutrient enrichment; Psidium guajava","Abril, G.A., Wannaz, E.D., Mateos, A.C., Pignata, M.L., Biomonitoring of airborne particulate matter emitted from a cement plant and comparison with dispersion modelling results (2014) Atmos.

The period 1950-1993 was used for calibration and 1994-2010 for validation. Bootstrap with replacement was applied to provide estimations of the statistical errors. All SD models performed reasonably well at regional scales, and the spatial distribution of the correlation coefficients between the predicted and observed gridded precipitation values shows high significant values (between 0.5 and 0.93) along the Andes range, north and north Pacific of Colombia.The ability of the GCMs to simulate the summer precipitation in Colombia, for the present climate (1971-2000), has been analyzed by calculating the differences between the simulated and observed precipitation values, with the result that the precipitation simulations made for the GCMs show strong biases. However, SD models applied to the SLP output from GCMs demonstrate their ability to faithfully reproduce the rainfall field. Finally, for summer precipitation projections in Colombia for the period 2071-2100, the SD models, recalibrated for the total period 1950-2010, have been applied to the SLP output from GCMs under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios.The SD estimations show considerable differences with respect to SD present values, generally towards precipitation increases. The SD MIROC5, HAdGEM2-AO, and CESM1(CAM5) present significant changes in all the regions for both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. So, for the RCP8.5 these models project changes between 12.85% and 18.32% for the NWC region, 6.73% and 10.02% for the SWC region, 6.16% and 14.76% for the NCC region, and 8.31% and 23.11% for the NC region. This last region, that presents the greatest increase (23.11%) for the SD MIROC5 also presents the greatest decrease (- 7.8% under the RCP8.5) for SD MPI-ESM-LR. For the RCP2.6, significant increases are found only for the NWC region with SD HadGEM2-AO (4.5%) and for the NC region with the SD CESM1(CAM5) (8.33%). © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Colombia; Precipitation; Principal component regression; Statistical downscaling","Alexander, M.A., Bladé, I., Newman, M., Lanzante, J.R., Lau, N.C., Scott, J.D., The atmospheric bridge: the influence of ENSO teleconnections on air-sea interaction over the global oceans (2002) J.

However, unnecessary ventilation can consume a huge amount of energy. Potential saving can be achieved by ensuring that efficient heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems are used. Moreover, reducing the energy consumption by adopting energy-efficient buildings can improve the thermal comfort of the occupants. In the hot and humid climates, natural ventilation by opening the windows and doors may enhance the humidity inside the building and affect comfort, consequently. Since humidity contributes to poor indoor quality and may be a major cause of discomfort, application of mechanical ventilation systems is increased compared with natural ventilation in tropical climates. Further, the power consumption of the air conditioners is increased. Accordingly, it is necessary to scrutinize the factors that influence the thermal comfort and indoor air quality that can be endured by the residents. In the current study, a review of the available literature on the thermal comfort and ventilation of the offices, classrooms and residential buildings in Malaysia and the surrounding regions was conducted. Additionally, prospective researches on different new cooling technologies were marked. Based on the findings, it concluded that thermal comfort range is higher than expected by international standards for hot-humid climate. It was also found that proper ventilation and healthy indoor air quality has great influence of sensation of thermal comfort via occupants of buildings. In point of fact, this work revealed that further research in these fields can provide a chance to improve thermal comfort and indoor air quality for occupants in hot and humid climate and minimize the energy consumption due to the application of air conditioner. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.","Energy; Hot and humid climate; Indoor air quality; Thermal comfort; Tracer gas decay method; Ventilation","Sekhar, S.C., Tham, K.W., Cheong, K.W., Indoor air quality and energy performance of air-conditioned office buildings in Singapore (2003) Indoor Air, 13, pp. 315-331; Noh, K.C., Jang, J.S., Oh, M.D., Thermal comfort and indoor air quality in the lecture room with 4-way cassette air-conditioner and mixing ventilation system (2007) Build Environ, 42, pp. 689-698; Cheong, K.W., Chong, K.Y., Development and application of an indoor air quality audit to air-conditioned building in Singapore (2001) Build Environ, 36, pp. 181-188; Hassan, M.A., Guirguis, N.M., Shaalan, M.R., El-Shazly, K.M., Investigation of effects of window combinations on ventilation characteristics for thermal comfort in buildings (2007) Desalination, 209, pp. 251-260; Cheong, K.W.D., Lau, H.Y.T., Development and application of an indoor air quality audit to an air-conditioned tertiary institutional building in the tropics (2003) Build Environ, 38, pp. 605-616; Fanger, P.O., Thermal comfort with varying temperatures: A graphic design tool (1970) Energy Build, 35, pp. 87-93; Ong, B.L., Designing for the individual: A radical reading of ISO 7730 (1995) Standards for Thermal Comfort, pp. 70-7. , London, UK; Jaakkola, J.J.K., Sick building syndrome in relation to indoor air temperature, relative humidity and air change (1994) Proceedings of Thermal Comfort: Past, pp. 168-81. , present and future.

Fermi 2749, Ispra (VA), Italy","Reliable compliance information of quantitative earth observation (EO) products is a prerequisite for future usages of satellite-derived evidence in (1) regulatory initiatives addressing air quality, development aid, climate risk, agricultural subsidies and the state of the environment among others, (2) liability debates between customers and providers of value-added (quantitative) EO products and services, and (3) auditing efforts and/or contractual negotiations for the operational exploitation of EO data. Irrespective of context, the conformity of an item can only be established with respect to permissible deviations from an agreed reference. The uncertainty of the reference should ideally be smaller than that of the candidate item, and their combined uncertainty should be smaller than the width of the interval defining permissible deviations. While these considerations are an integral part of conformity testing in legal metrology they are not yet included in validation efforts of satellite-derived quantitative surface information. Outside of scientific application contexts, however, the certified compliance of quantitative earth observation products is likely to induce new usages of such information in commercial, judiciary and regulatory contexts. This contribution introduces conformity testing and compares it to validation efforts assessing the value of biophysical EO products with respect to the quality objectives provided by the global climate observing system (GCOS). The findings suggest that, (1) current GCOS quality objectives must be complemented before they may serve as unambiguous requirements for conformity testing of EO products, (2) a consensus on the choice of decision rules must be sought (between data providers and users) since this has a direct impact on what is deemed compliant, and (3) the uncertainty associated with current field validation methods for quantitative biophysical variables is presumably too large to meet the ISO-13528 criteria. The latter thus challenges the eligibility of current field validation methods to provide the reference needed in efforts assessing GCOS compliance of third party EO datasets. © 2015 .","Climate change; Conformity testing; COPERNICUS; Earth observation; ECV; Environmental regulations; GCOS compliance; Quality assurance","(2001) Guidelines for Decision Rules: Considering Measurement Uncertainty in Determining Conformance to Specifications, , American Society of Mechanical Engineers, ASME B89.7.3.1:2001, New York; Baret, F., Weiss, M., Lacaze, R., Camacho, F., Makhmara, H., Pacholcyzk, P., Smets, B., GEOV1: LAI and FAPAR essential climate variables and FCOVER global time series capitalizing over existing products.

Both lakes were analyzed at high temporal resolution and record vegetation dynamics over the last 1000. years. Throughout the past 1000. years, Pinus, Tsuga, Betula, Quercus, Acer and Fagus were the dominant taxa in the pollen record. From 950-1550. AD the forest was dominated by Tsuga, Fagus and Acer. Between 1550 and 1730. AD Pinus e abundant and/or had increased relative pollen production. Low pollen influx to the sediment, high values of Pinus and relatively low values of Tsuga and hardwoods between 1730 and 1870. AD suggest colder temperatures. Since 1870. AD, herbaceous plants (weeds) increased in abundance, whereas softwoods decreased and hardwoods increased, due to landscape changes associated with European settlement. A comparison of the temperature reconstruction based on the pollen assemblages and the Toronto and Ottawa climate records shows a close correspondence, suggesting pollen records can record decadal-scale climate fluctuations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Fire history; Holocene; Lake sediments; Ontario; Pollen; Quantitative climate reconstruction","Armstrong, C.A., (1976) Away Back in Clarendon and Miller, , General Store Publishing House, Renfrew, ON; Axford, M., Brumell, I., Flieler, E., McCulloch, C., Morrow, C., (2008) The Oxen and the Axe, , The Cloyne and District Historical Society, Cloyne, Ontario; Bernabo, J.C., Webb, T., Changing patterns in the Holocene pollen record of Northeastern North America: a mapped summary (1977) Quat.

Air-to-air heat/energy recovery is a well-known and effective method to reduce the energy consumption. However, frosting commonly occurs inside heat/energy exchangers in cold climates, which would significantly degrade the performance of the exchangers. Preheating the outdoor air and bypassing the outdoor airflow are two effective methods for frosting prevention or defrosting. In this study, the performance of two cross-flow heat/energy exchangers at frosting and defrosting periods are experimentally tested under different operating conditions and the values of frosting limit and defrosting time ratio are presented. As well, the effects of these two defrosting methods on energy consumption of ventilation in three cold cities (i.e. Saskatoon, Anchorage and Chicago) are evaluated. The results show the outdoor air preheating method performs better than the outdoor air bypassing method. In addition, the heat/energy recovery potential in Saskatoon undergoes the largest reduction under frosting, and the cold weather conditions have less impact on energy exchangers than heat exchangers for heat/energy recovery. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Air-to-air energy exchanger; Cold climate; Defrosting; Energy consumption; Ventilation","Zhang, L.Z., Xiao, F., Simultaneous heat and moisture transfer through a composite supported liquid membrane (2008) Int J Heat Mass Transfer, 51 (9-10), pp. 2179-2189; Besant, R.W., Simonson, C.J., Air-to-air energy recovery (2003) ASHRAE J, 45 (4), pp. 42-52; Rasouli, M., Ge, G.M., Simonson, C.J., Besant, R.W., Uncertainties in energy and economic performance of HVAC systems and energy recovery ventilators due to uncertainties in building and HVAC parameters (2013) Appl Therm Eng, 50, pp. 732-742; Rasouli, M., Simonson, C.J., Besant, R.W., Applicability and optimum control strategy of energy recovery ventilators in different climatic conditions (2010) Energy Build, 42 (9), pp. 1376-1385; Xiao, F., Ge, G.M., Niu, X.F., Control performance of a dedicated outdoor air system adopting liquid desiccant dehumidification (2011) Appl Energy, 88, pp. 143-149; Abdel-Salam, A.H., Simonson, C.J., Annual evaluation of energy, environmental and economic performance of a membrane liquid desiccant air conditioning system with/without ERV (2014) Appl Energy, 116, pp. 134-148; Rafati Nasr, M., Fauchoux, M., Besant, R.W., Simonson, C.J., A review of frosting in air-to-air energy exchangers (2014) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 30, pp. 538-554; Wu, J.H., Ouyang, G., Hou, P.X., Xiao, H.B., Experimental investigation of frost formation on a parallel flow evaporator (2011) Appl Energy, 88, pp. 1549-1556; Fisk, W.J., Chant, R.E., Archer, K.M., Hekmat, D., Offermann, F.J., Pedersen, B.S., Performance of residential air-to-air heat exchangers during operation with freezing and periodic defrosts (1985) ASHRAE Trans, 91, pp. 159-172; Gong, G.C., Tang, J.C., Lv, D.Y., Wang, H.J., Research on frost formation in air source heat pump at cold-moist conditions in central-south China (2013) Appl Energy, 102, pp. 571-581; Phillips, E.G., Chant, R.E., Bradley, B.C., Fisher, D.R., A model to compare freezing control strategies for residential air-to-air heat recovery ventilators (1989) ASHRAE Trans, 95, pp. 475-483; Gazi, I.M., Simonson, C.J., Frosting conditions for an energy wheel in laboratory simulated extreme cold weather (2012) Proceedings of the 7th international cold climate HVAC conference, pp. 223-232. , 12-14 November, 2012, Calgary, Alberta, Canada; Rafati Nasr, M., Fauchoux, M., Kadylak, D., Huizing, R., Simonson, C.J., Frosting limit in air-to-air membrane energy exchangers.

This paper provides a novel methodological approach to assess regulating ES mismatches on the basis of environmental quality standards and policy goals. Environmental quality standards (EQS) indicate the relationship between environmental quality and human well-being. Thus, they can be used as a common minimum threshold value to determine whether the difference between ES supply and demand is problematic for human well-being. The methodological approach includes three main steps: (1) selection of EQS, (2) definition and quantification of ES supply and demand indicators, and (3) identification and assessment of ES mismatches on the basis of EQS considering certain additional criteria. While ES supply indicators estimate the flow of an ES actually used or delivered, ES demand indicators express the amount of regulation needed in relation to the standard. The approach is applied to a case study consisting of five European cities: Barcelona, Berlin, Stockholm, Rotterdam and Salzburg, considering three regulating ES which are relevant in urban areas: air purification, global climate regulation and urban temperature regulation. The results show that levels of ES supply and demand are highly heterogeneous across the five studied cities and across the EQS considered. The assessment shows that ES supply contributes very moderately in relation to the compliance with the EQS in most part of the identified mismatches. Therefore, this research suggests that regulating ES supplied by urban green infrastructure are expected to play only a minor or complementary role to other urban policies intended to abate air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions at the city scale. The approach has revealed to be appropriate for the regulating ES air purification and global climate regulation, for which well-established standards or targets are available at the city level. Yet, its applicability to the ES urban temperature regulation has proved more problematic due to scale and user dependent constraints. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyzed SDM performance and partitioned variance among prediction maps for 15 rare vertebrate species in the southeastern USA using all possible combinations of seven potential sources of uncertainty in SDMs: algorithms, climate datasets, model domain, species presences, variable collinearity, CO<inf>2</inf> emissions scenarios, and general circulation models. The choice of modeling algorithm was the greatest source of uncertainty in SDM performance and prediction maps, with some additional variation in performance associated with the comprehensiveness of the species presences used for modeling. Other sources of uncertainty that have received attention in the SDM literature such as variable collinearity and model domain contributed little to differences in SDM performance or predictions in this study. Predictions from different algorithms tended to be more variable at northern range margins for species with more northern distributions, which may complicate conservation planning at the leading edge of species' geographic ranges. The clear message emerging from this work is that researchers should use multiple algorithms for modeling rather than relying on predictions from a single algorithm, invest resources in compiling a comprehensive set of species presences, and explicitly evaluate uncertainty in SDM predictions at leading range margins. © 2015 .","Climate envelope; Niche model; Sensitivity analysis; Spatial analysis","Allouche, O., Tsoar, A., Kadmon, R., Assessing the accuracy of species distribution models: prevalence, kappa and the true skill statistic (TSS) (2006) J.

They are important ecological systems and can be used to support sustainable development of industry and agriculture. However, due to climate warming, most glaciers are in a state of rapid retreat. Using topographic maps in 1959, ASTER remote sensing data in 2008 and ASTER digital elevation models (DEMs), area, ice surface elevation, and volume changes of glaciers on the Friendship Peak in the Chinese Altai Mountains were analyzed. Results showed that the collective area of all 201 glaciers investigated was reduced by 30.4% from 1959 to 2008. Fifty-five glaciers disappeared entirely. The average rates of reduction in area of glaciers with sizes <0.5, 0.5-1, 1-4, 4-10, and >10km2 were 25.9%, 30.8%, 30.9%, 35.9%, and 27.4%, respectively. From 1959 to 2008, the elevation of the glacier surface decreased by 20m at an average rate of 0.4ma-1. For the Kanas Glacier, the changes in ice surface elevation ranged from -101 to +38m. Results showed that glaciers at lower altitudes and smaller sizes experienced more extensive changes in elevation. The intensive glacier ablation over the Friendship Peak in the Altai Mountains was found to be caused by increases in the regional temperature, which occurred at an average rate of 0.52°C per decade. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Altai Mountains; Climate change; Friendship Peak; Glacier change; Ice surface elevation change","Aizen, V.B., Kuzmichenok, V.A., Surazakov, A.B., Aizen, E.M., Glacier changes in central and northern Tien Shan during the last 140years based on surface and remote sensing data (2006) Ann.

This study focuses on identifying existing trends in annual, seasonal and monthly rainfall at thirteen stations in the Onkaparinga catchment in South Australia during the period 1960-2010. A relatively new trend detection approach, which combines a Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) with the Mann Kendall (MK) test, was applied in this study. The original rainfall time series was decomposed to different periodic components using a CWT and then the MK test was applied to detect the trends. One station showed a statistically significant (at the 5% level) negative trend for annual rainfall. Winter rainfall exhibited significant positive trends at four stations. In the case of monthly rainfall, significant positive trends were observed in June (at seven stations), November (at one station) and December (at one station). The study showed that the periodic components might have significant trends even when there are no significant trends in the original data. The periodic component that dominates the trend in the original data varies from season to season. A sequential Mann-Kendall analysis was found useful for identifying the trend turning points. Most of the trends, whether positive or negative, started during the mid-1970s to mid-1980s. The technique developed in this study may also be applied for trend detection of other hydro-climatic variables in other catchments, particularly where temporal and spatial variabilities are high. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Continuous Wavelet Transform; Mann-Kendall trend test; Periodicity; Rainfall; Trend analysis","Adamowski, K., Prokoph, A., Adamowski, J., Development of a new method of wavelet aided trend detection and estimation (2009) Hydrol Process, 23, pp. 2686-2696; Ampitiyawatta, A., Guo, S., Precipitation trends in the Kalu Ganga basin in Sri Lanka (2009) J Agric Sci, 4, pp. 10-18; Antonopoulos, V.Z., Papamichail, D.M., Mitsiou, K.A., Statistical and trend analysis of water quality and quantity data for the Strymon River in Greece (2001) Hydrol Earth Syst Sci Discuss, 5, pp. 679-692; Beecham, S., Chowdhury, R., Temporal characteristics and variability of point rainfall: a statistical and wavelet analysis (2010) Int J Climatol, 30, pp. 458-473; Beecham, S., Rashid, M., Chowdhury, R.K., Statistical downscaling of multi-site daily rainfall in a South Australian catchment using a generalized linear model (2014) Int J Climatol R Meteorol Soc; Birsan, M.-V., Molnar, P., Burlando, P., Pfaundler, M., Streamflow trends in Switzerland (2005) J Hydrol, 314, pp. 312-329; Brunetti, M., Colacino, M., Maugeri, M., Nanni, T., Trends in the daily intensity of precipitation in Italy from 1951 to 1996 (2001) Int J Climatol, 21, pp. 299-316; Burn, D.H., Hag Elnur, M.A., Detection of hydrologic trends and variability (2002) J Hydrol, 255, pp. 107-122; Cai, W., Cowan, T., Sullivan, A., Recent unprecedented skewness towards positive Indian Ocean Dipole occurrences and its impact on Australian rainfall (2009) Geophys Res Lett, 36, p.

Biomass energy in Turkey is one of the most important renewable energy sources in terms of energy potential. Traditional biomass (wood and dung) in Turkey has a significant energy production rate. This ratio has been decreased with the decline of forests and the reduction seen in animal husbandry, recently. Traditional biomass is usually used in the form of non-commercial fuel and meets a quarter of the domestic energy production. Traditional biomass energy production has been planned 7530 Btep in 2020. In Turkey, the use of modern biomass energy is important in terms of the country's economy, and the environment pollution. Turkey has the potential to provide an alternative source of energy from the most appropriate and most cost-effective agricultural products according to its ecological conditions. Modern biomass started with 17 Btep in 2000. However, there has not been the foresight to future production. Whereas traditional biomass energy production should increasingly be reduced and modern biomass energy production should be increased. This situation will offer new investment fields to investors. This study shows that biomass energy continues to be the main source of energy for climate change mitigation and energy sustainability in Turkey, particularly in its traditional forms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, our understanding of vegetation seasonality is mostly limited to the mechanisms and attributes of phenological events, such as spring emergence and fall senescence. Here we have investigated the seasonal evolution of vegetation growth from winter dormancy to summer maturity of four forest types in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperate and boreal forests for 1982-2011. The present study assesses large-scale variations in the vegetation green-up rate (VG<inf>rate</inf>) and its connection to temperature variability using remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface air temperature. The average of the VG<inf>rate</inf> of the analysis period increases with latitude, which indicates that the canopy develops more rapidly from dormancy to maturity for vegetation in higher-latitude or colder climate zones. VG<inf>rate</inf> and precedent temperature also show a positive correlation (r) over temperate and boreal forests (67% of the forest area in the NH), indicating that increased temperatures lead to faster canopy development within the same climate zone or latitude band. Responsiveness of VG<inf>rate</inf> to temperature variability shows that despite the same magnitude of local temperature variability during extremely cold and warm years, the magnitude of VG<inf>rate</inf> acceleration in warm years (0.07 (15-day)-1) is larger than the VG<inf>rate</inf> deceleration in cold years (-0.03 (15-day)-1), suggesting that the response of VG<inf>rate</inf> to temperature variability is nonlinear. Among the four forest types examined in this study, the nonlinear responses are most clearly observed in deciduous broadleaf forests indicating that forest composition may regulate the large-scale response of canopy development to temperature variability. Overall, our results suggest that anomalous seasonal warming will significantly affect canopy developments over wide deciduous forest areas. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Climate variability; Global ecology;

The concept of biochar drew its inspiration from Amazonian practices that had led to the creation of Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE): fertile soils rich in (bio)char and human artefacts. In this article, we conceptualize biochar as an emerging policy arrangement, and examine it along the four dimensions of the Policy Arrangement Approach (PAA), which are actors, discourse, power and rules. We focus on Brazil as an important player in the international biochar debate. Our analysis shows that science experts are the predominant players in the network, while policy-makers, businessmen and farmers are marginally positioned. Experts from Embrapa occupy central positions and thus exercise most power in the network. Moreover, experts linked to ADE have lost prominence in the network. The reason for this is to be found in the shift from the ADE/biochar to the biochar/technology discourse. The latter discourse includes different coalitions such as 'climate change mitigation', the 'improvement of soil fertility' and 'improving crop residue management'. Although the biochar/climate coalition is dominant at the international level, it is far less prominent in Brazil. Nationally, it is particularly the discourses of 'improvement of soil fertility' and 'improving crop residue management' which have prompted actors' relationships and practices. However, the biochar/technology discourse has not (yet) been formally institutionalized in Brazil. As a consequence, the country lacks an established biochar policy field. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Actors; Amazonian dark earth; Discourse coalitions; Power; Social network; Terra preta de índio","Arts, B., Buizer, M., Forests, discourses, institutions (2009) For.

Identification of polyphenolic compounds and investigation of their genetic basis among diverse rice genotypes provides the basis for the improvement of the nutraceutical properties of whole rice grain. This review focuses on current information on the identification, genetic diversity, formation and distribution patterns of the phenolic acid, anthocyanin, and proanthocyanidins in whole rice grain. The genetic analysis of polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity allows the identification of several candidate genes or quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for polyphenol variation, which may be useful in improvement of these phytochemicals by breeding. Future challenges such as how to mitigate the effects of climate change while improving nutraceutical properties in whole grain, and how to use new technology to develop new rice high in nutraceutical properties are also presented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Genetics; Health benefits; Nutraceutical property; Polyphenols; Rice (Oryza sativa L.)","Bashir, K., Ishimaru, Y., Shimo, H., Kakei, Y., Senoura, T., Takahashi, R., Rice phenolics efflux transporter 2 (PEZ2) plays an important role in solubilizing apoplasmic iron (2011) Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, 57, pp. 803-812; Bordiga, M., Gomez-Alonso, S., Locatelli, M., Travaglia, F., Coïsson, J.D., Hermosin-Gutierrez, I., Phenolics characterization and antioxidant activity of six different pigmented Oryza sativa L.

Water and energy fluxes in different topographical regions have been affected by both climate change and human activities. In the plain regions, actual evapotranspiration (ET<inf>a</inf>) has generally decreased during the study period, which can be attributed to decreased net radiation, precipitation and rapid urbanization. The water deficit has continued in the plains regions due to extensive pumping for irrigation to meet the deficit of crop water. However, irrigation has led to significant groundwater depletion, which poses a significant challenge to the sustainability of water resources. In the mountain regions, decreases in sensible heat flux and increases in ET<inf>a</inf> have caused a decrease in the Bowen ratio. These changes in water and energy fluxes have brought a positive ecological effect, but the increase in ET<inf>a</inf> in the mountain regions has resulted in a substantial reduction of water yield and consequently a negative effect on water resources in this basin. These changes in water and energy fluxes across the Haihe River Basin have made the water issue more complex and require integrated river basin management. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate impacts; Evapotranspiration; Haihe River Basin; Human impacts; Spatial and temporal change; Water and energy flux","Abdi, H., (2010) Coefficient of Variation, Encyclopedia of Research Design, pp. 169-171. , SAGE Publications Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA; Ahlgren, P., Jarneving, B., Rousseau, R., Requirements for a cocitation similarity measure, with special reference to Pearson's correlation coefficient (2003) J.

However, the effects of living in low and variable salinity regimes are rarely considered in models describing mussel growth. The aim of the present study was to incorporate the effects of low salinity into an eco-physiological model of blue mussels and to identify areas suitable for mussel production. A Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model was modified with respect to i) the morphological parameters (DW/WW-ratio, shape factor), ii) change in ingestion rate and iii) metabolic costs due to osmoregulation in different salinity environments. The modified DEB model was validated with experimental data from different locations in the Western Baltic Sea (including the Limfjorden) with salinities varying from 8.5 to 29.9. psu. The identified areas suitable for mussel production in the Baltic Sea are located in the Little Belt area, the Great Belt, the southern Kattegat and the Limfjorden according to the prevailing salinity regimes. The new model can be used for supporting site selection of new mussel nutrient extraction cultures in the Baltic Sea that suffers from high eutrophication symptoms or as part of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture production. The model can also be used to predict the effects of salinity changes on mussel populations e.g. in climate change studies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Baltic Sea; DEB model; Growth; Mussel culture; Nutrient extraction; Salinity","Andersen, J.H., Axe, P., Backer, H., Carstensen, J., Claussen, U., Fleming-Lehtinen, V., Jarvinen, M., Villnas, A., Getting the measure of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea: towards improved assessment principles and methods (2011) Biogeochemistry, 106 (2), pp. 137-156; Bayne, B.L., Widdows, J., Physiological ecology of 2 populations of Mytilus edulis l (1978) Oecologia, 37 (2), pp. 137-162; Beadman, H.A., Willows, R.I., Kaiser, M.J., Potential applications of mussel modelling (2002) Helgol.

To avoid this contention, greater use of wind energy could be the solution for economic growth and sustainable environment, in the long run. This paper discusses the ways in which India has started the growth of wind energy and the country's potential to expand its contribution to meet ever-increasing energy needs. The paper lucidly presents India's progress to become the top five wind energy producers in the world. This paper also discusses the major achievements, programs, policy, and incentives for the installation of wind power in India.

However, when timber from deforestation is replaced by sustainably managed forest plantations, a carbon neutral process emerges. Yet the cost of growing trees can be large enough to discourage mills from pursuing such a climate change mitigation route. The paper shows that the impasse can be overcome by the improvement of pyrolysis kilns coupled with a multilateral agreement in which (1) Brazil supplies attested carbon-neutral MPI and (2) importers of Brazilian MPI take environmental concerns to the field of MPI trade, paying a premium of 19% of MPI price or of US$3 per ton of avoided emissions. © 2015 International Energy Initiative.","Carbon pricing; Climate change; Deforestation; Merchant pig iron","ABRAF statistical yearbook (2010), http://www.abraflor.org.br/estatisticas.asp, Brazilian Association of Forest Plantation Producers [Base year: 2009Abramovay, R., Decarbonizing the growth model of Brazil: addressing both carbon and energy intensity (2010) J Environ Dev, 19, p. 358; Trade database of the Brazilian Ministry Development, Industry and Foreign Trade (2014), aliceweb.mdic.gov.br//index/home, Merchant pig iron export data (Commodity 7201.10.0100 on NCM nomenclature)Use of charcoal from renewable biomass plantations as reducing agent in pig iron mill at ArcelorMittal Juiz de Fora, Brazil (2009) Project Development Document Form, , http://cdm.unfccc.int/index.html, (Arcelor Mittal Brazil).

Hence, a thorough, mechanistic understanding of the processes responsible for N loss and retention such as denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) in these soils is urgently needed. Here we aimed to explore the relationships between denitrifier gene abundance and expression with N<inf>2</inf> and N<inf>2</inf>O production and the importance of DNRA versus denitrification in nitrate consumption and N<inf>2</inf>O production for typical montane grassland soils of Southern Germany. In a laboratory incubation experiment with glucose and nitrate addition, we combined direct measurements of N<inf>2</inf>O and N<inf>2</inf> production with a molecular analysis of the denitrifier communities involved in nitrite, nitric oxide (NO) and N<inf>2</inf>O reduction and with the quantification of DNRA. The soils originated from a space-for-time climate change experiment, where intact plant-soil mesocosms were exposed for three years either to ambient conditions at a high elevation site (""HE"" control treatment) or to predicted climate change conditions (warming, reduced summer precipitation and reduced winter snow cover) by translocation to lower elevation (""LE"" climate change treatment).The abundance (DNA) of cnorB genes was significantly reduced in LE soils, whereas the abundance of nosZ genes did not differ between the HE and LE soils. However, the decreased abundance of cnorB genes unexpectedly resulted in slightly increased rather than decreased potential N<inf>2</inf>O emissions. This effect could be explained by the increased levels of cnorB mRNA and, therefore, the higher physiological activity of the NO reducers in the LE soils. In contrast with the DNA levels, the dynamics of the cnorB mRNA levels followed N<inf>2</inf>O emission patterns, whereas the nosZ expression was strongly correlated with the N<inf>2</inf> emission (R2=0.83). The potential rates of DNRA were approximately one-third of the rates of denitrification, and DNRA was not a source for N<inf>2</inf>O.We conclude that DNRA significantly competes with denitrification in these soils, thus contributing to N conservation.

For this expansion mountainous areas are regarded as specifically suitable because of their high-energy potential. However, mountains also are biodiversity hot-spots and provide scenic landscapes and therefore offer high natural and cultural value. Preserving this natural and cultural value whilst intensifying RE, is expected to increase land use conflicts. This is of great concern in particular for vulnerable areas such as the Alps. Reconciling RE expansion with the preservation of natural and cultural values and thus minimizing environmental impacts represents one of the most important challenges now. For this a systematic assessment of the wide range of impacts is needed. This literature review scrutinizes RE resources which are relevant in the Alpine region and their effects on the environment by applying the Ecosystem Service approach. Thereby, we identified possible environmental constraints when exploiting Alpine RE potentials and generated recommendations for future strategies on expanding RE. The outcomes highlight the strong need for interdisciplinary research on RE and environmental conflicts. Interdisciplinary approaches such as the concept of Ecosystem Services can help to cover the wide range of aspects associated with these particular human-environment interrelations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To cope with such threads and vulnerabilities, urban sustainability and resilience oriented plans have been developed. Accordingly, policy makers need to learn how to properly integrate urban sustainability with urban resilience principles and practices in the re-shaping of urban agendas. In order to highlight the future potential of integrating transformative resilience principles into the general sustainability approach, this paper provides a critical review of a recent and successful urban regeneration and development plan, the ""Mexico City Green Plan"". This paper also discusses a feasibility study for urban redevelopment and transition towards resilience in Mexico City, in order to illustrate the necessity and potential of urban resilience for the improvement of the life prospects of disadvantaged inhabitant groups. The Valle del Chalco neighborhood in Mexico City is presented as an example, whereby resilient and sustainable urban transformation was achieved through an integrated and sustainable decentralized water management and infrastructure plan. In practice, the terms 'Sustainability' and 'Resilience' can be exploited to justify conventional, non-sustainable urban development practices. The results discussed in this paper demonstrate the necessity of the integration of transformative resilience principles within sustainable urban redevelopment and regeneration. The main findings are i) Policy makers underestimate the potential of urban resilience in shaping more sustainable urban futures, since they only understand resilience as the flipside of specific vulnerabilities, ii) The building of urban resilience within sustainable urban transitions and redevelopment can effectively foster people empowerment, particularly in combination with the decentralization of resources management systems, and iii) The main challenge for the implementation and execution of transitions processes towards urban resilience and sustainability is the elimination of political barriers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change adaptation; Decentralized water management; Mexico City Green Plan; Neglected neighborhoods; Urban resilience; Urban sustainability","Adger, W.N., Vulnerability (2006) Global Environmental Change, 16 (3), pp. 268-281. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.02.006; Amin, M.T., Alazba, A.A., ElNesr, M.N., Adaptation of climate variability/extreme in arid environment of the Arabian peninsula by rainwater harvesting and management (2013) International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, 10 (1), pp. 27-36; Baker, J.L., (2012) Climate change, disaster risk, and the urban Poor: Cities building resilience for a changing world, , World Bank Publications; Boers, T.M., Benasher, J., Areview of rainwater harvesting (1982) Agricultural Water Management, 5 (2), pp. 145-158; Carmin, J., Anguelovski, I., Roberts, D., Urban climate adaptation in the global south: planning in an emerging policy domain (2012) Journal of Planning Education and Research, 32 (1), pp. 18-32; Cerón-Palma, I., Sanyé-Mengual, E., Oliver-Solà, J., Montero, J.-I., Ponce-Caballero, C., Rieradevall, J., Towards a green sustainable strategy for social neighbourhoods in Latin America: case from social housing in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico (2013) Habitat International, 38 (0), pp. 47-56. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2012.09.008; Chelleri, L., Olazabal, M., (2012) Multidisciplinary perspectives on urban resilience, , Basque centre for Climate Change (BC3), Bilbao; Chelleri, L., Waters, J.J., Olazabal, M., Minucci, G., Resilience trade-offs: addressing multiple scales and temporal aspects of urban resilience (2015) Environment and Urbanization; Collier, M.J., Nedović-Budić, Z., Aerts, J., Connop, S., Foley, D., Foley, K., Transitioning to resilience and sustainability in urban communities (2013) Cities, 32 (1), pp. S21-S28; Domenech, L., Han, H.J., Sauri, D., Rainwater harvesting for human consumption and livelihood improvement in rural Nepal: benefits and risks (2012) Water and Environment Journal, 26 (4), pp. 465-472; Elmqvist, T., Urban resilience thinking (2014) Solutions, 5 (5), pp. 26-30; Folke, C., Carpenter, S.R., Walker, B., Scheffer, M., Chapin, T., Rockström, J., Resilience thinking: integrating resilience, adaptability and transformability (2010) Ecology and Society, 15 (4), p. 20; Gallopín, G.C., Linkages between vulnerability, resilience, and adaptive capacity (2006) Global Environmental Change, 16 (3), pp. 293-303. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.02.004; Garrido, S., Aviles, M., Ramirez, A., Gonzalez, A., Montellano, L., Gonzalez, B., Improving collected rainwater quality in rural communities (2011) Water science and Technology, 63 (10), pp. 2395-2402; Grimm, N.B., Faeth, S.H., Golubiewski, N.E., Redman, C.L., Wu, J., Bai, X., Global change and the ecology of cities (2008) Science, 319 (5864), pp. 756-760; Kyessi, A.G., Community-based urban water management in fringe neighbourhoods: the case of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (2005) Habitat International, 29 (1), pp. 1-25; Lizarralde, G., Chmutina, K., Bosher, L., Dainty, A., Sustainability and resilience in the built environment: the challenges of establishing a turquoise agenda in the UK (2015) Sustainable Cities and Society, 15 (0), pp. 96-104. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2014.12.004; Lopez, A., (2011) From threat to opportunity.

Three general principles - responsibilities, capabilities (capacity), and needs (or rights) - are frequently invoked and rarely disputed. Yet, parties' interpretations often diverge, reflecting conflicts of interests. To determine how much is at stake, we compare - by means of a global integrated assessment model (GRACE) - 15 legitimate interpretations of 'responsibilities' and 'capabilities' in terms of their implications for the mitigation obligations and costs of seven potentially pivotal actors. Most of these interpretations yield similar results for most actors. In a scenario where global emissions in 2030 are reduced by 20% compared to a business-as-usual baseline, mitigation costs vary by less than 1% of GDP for the United States, the European Union, Japan, India, and China. For Brazil and Russia, however, variance is much larger. Moreover, for all actors, mitigation costs rise steeply as ambition levels increase. Under such circumstances, searching for a single 'fairness-optimizing' formula is likely to fail. As negotiators explore systems of voluntary pledges, a more promising approach would conceive of fairness as a multidimensional construct and foster accommodation through mutual recognition of a limited range of legitimate norm interpretations. © 2015.","Capabilities; Equity; Fairness; Mitigation; Mutual recognition; Responsibilities","Aaheim, A., Amundsen, H., Dokken, T., Wei, T., Impacts and adaptation to climate change in European economies (2012) Global Environ.

Over a 12-year period, we consider the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the growing season (May to September) for deciduous forest and grasslands, as well as precipitation, temperature, and soil moisture data at a biweekly time scale. Using three different vegetation growth metrics, we analyze patterns in vegetation responses. An entropy scaling of the system of vegetation-soil moisture-precipitation-temperature reveals trends toward maximum entropy and shows the relevance of coupling these atmospheric variables in vegetation dynamic analysis. Our analysis indicates that soil moisture is potentially efficient to use for vegetation dynamics monitoring at finer time scales compared to precipitation. The near-surface (5. cm) soil moisture series shows meaningful relationship with vegetation growth series. This seems interesting, as the recent satellite soil moisture monitoring projects are designed for estimating near-surface moisture. Month-wise, the vegetation response to atmospheric variables shows important dissimilarities. Therefore, we use an entropy-based clustering approach to discriminate the growing season. Later, we propose a nested statistical model for retrieving an estimate of NDVI. We find that the inclusion of soil moisture and temperature explains up to 68% and 62% of the variation of NDVI, respectively, for deciduous forest and grassland during June and July. However, these relationships appear weaker during the end of the growing season (August and September). The outcomes of the study are suitable for ecosystem monitoring under the realm of climate change. Likewise, the techniques employed may find useful applications for water resources management at the scale of large watersheds. Nevertheless, further studies on the topic are necessary and should involve diversified ecosystems and remote sensed products. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric variables; Entropy theory; NDVI; Texas Gulf watershed","Species distribution models and ecological theory: a critical assessment and some possible new approaches (2007) Ecol.

In this study, the Bayesian geostatistics was applied to assess the uncertainty associated with the predictive models of SOC (top soils) in a large region - Florida, USA. Results showed that the Bayesian estimates of model parameters were comparable to the conventional geostatistical methods especially the restricted maximum likelihood (REML). The Bayesian prediction uncertainty assessment was encouragingly accurate based on the validation of 50 and 95% prediction intervals with the validation dataset. Generally, the width of prediction intervals increased with the posterior mean SOC predictions - large prediction intervals were found in the Everglades Agricultural Area (Histosols) and the wetland areas in the Suwannee River Basin. The Bayesian constant mean model (high model inadequacy) had marked prediction uncertainty which was reduced by accounting for the effects of environmental covariates in the Bayesian linear trend model (low model inadequacy), indicating that model inadequacy had a negative impact on prediction uncertainty. Analyses of factors impacting SOC prediction uncertainty suggest that effects that explained more of the SOC variance contributed more uncertainty to the SOC prediction. These findings are critical to quantify SOC stocks in the southeastern USA where a heterogeneous mosaic of high and low carbon in soils occurs ranging from 0.45 to 34.15 kg m-2. Although this study considers only the topsoil, the results are valuable for global carbon cycling research.

The objective of this study was to evaluate direct and indirect effects of climate on litter decomposition along an altitudinal gradient in a temperate Alpine region. Foliar litter of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and Black pine (Pinus nigra) was incubated in litterbags during two years in the Hochschwab massif of the Northern Limestone Alps of Austria. Eight incubation sites were selected following an altitudinal/climatic transect from 1900 to 900 m asl. The average remaining mass after two years of decomposition amounted to 54% (beech) and 50% (pine). Net release of N, P, Na, Al, Fe and Mn was higher in pine than in beech litter due to high immobilization (retention) rates of beech litter. However, pine litter retained more Ca than beech litter. Altitude retarded decay (mass loss and associated C release) in beech litter during the first year only but had a longer lasting effect on decaying pine litter. Altitude comprises a suite of highly auto-correlated characteristics (climate, vegetation, litter, soil chemistry, soil microbiology, snow cover) that influence litter decomposition. Hence, decay and nutrient release of incubated litter is difficult to predict by altitude, except during the early stage of decomposition, which seemed to be controlled by climate. Reciprocal litter transplant along the elevation gradient yielded even relatively higher decay of pine litter on beech forest sites after a two-year adaptation period of the microbial community. © 2015.","Climosequence; Decomposition; Elevation gradient; Fagus sylvatica; Litterbag; Pinus nigra","Aerts, R., Climate, leaf litter chemistry and leaf litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems: a triangular relationship (1997) Oikos, 79, pp. 439-449; Albers, D., Migge, S., Schaefer, M., Scheu, S., Decomposition of beech leaves (Fagus sylvatica) and spruce needles (Picea abies) in pure and mixed stands of beech and spruce (2004) Soil Biol.

Heuweltjies are commonly believed to be produced by fossorial fauna (termites and mammals), although it is also possible that they are the consequence of vegetation stabilising soil against erosion and/or trapping aeolian sediment. We sampled mound presence/absence in South Africa and analysed environmental correlates with mound distribution. Mounds mostly occur in sparse (0.1<NDVI<0.5) semi-arid Mediterranean-climate Succulent Karoo vegetation at modest elevations (<1000m) with relatively high average annual wind speeds. These correlates are consistent with aeolian deposition of sediment in vegetation patches, but not with a termite-induced pattern. We analysed the spatial characteristics of mounds at 23 sites and found that over-dispersion is strongest and the size of mounds smallest closest to neighbouring mounds, indicating competitive interactions between mounds. Large inter-mound distances (ca. 40m) make it unlikely that spacing is a direct consequence of root-based inter-plant competition. Rather, spacing is likely to be related to the influences of neighbouring mounds on aeolian sediment accretion. We suggest that the mounds arose in the Mediterranean climate zone at a time of greater aridity than currently. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Coppice dunes; Heuweltjie; Mediterranean climate; Nabkha; Nebkha; Vegetation pattern","Barnes, G.W., The hillocks or mound-formations of San Diego, California (1879) Am.

The predominant technocratic and decisionist responses to this question misleadingly assume that value-neutral scientific recommendations for public policy means, or even objectives, are possible. On the other end of the spectrum, the literature on democratic and pragmatic models of expertise in policy often does not satisfactorily explain what researchers can contribute to public discourses surrounding disputed, value-laden policy objectives and means. Building on John Dewey's philosophy, this article develops the ""pragmatic-enlightened model"" (PEM) of assessment making, which refines the existing pragmatic models. It is used to some extent by Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. According to the PEM's policy assessment methodology, policy objectives and their means can only be evaluated in light of the practical consequences of the means. Learning about the secondary effects, side effects and synergies of the best means may require a revaluation of the policy objectives, for instance, regarding the use of bioenergy for climate mitigation. Following the PEM, assessments would-based on a thorough problem analysis-explore alternative policy pathways, including their diverse practical consequences, overlaps and trade-offs, in cooperation with stakeholders. Such an arduous interdisciplinary cartography of multiple objectives, multi-functional policy means and the broad range of their quantitative and qualitative practical consequences may face considerable practical challenges and uncertainty. Yet, it could make assessments more policy-relevant and less prescriptive, and could effectively support a learning process about the political solution space. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Environmental assessment; Means-consequence; Policy pathway; Public policy analysis; Side effect; Value judgement","Brown, M.B., (2009) Science in Democracy: Expertise, Institutions, and Representation, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Cash, D.W., Clark, W.C., Alcock, F., Dickson, N.M., Eckley, N., Guston, D.H., Knowledge systems for sustainable development (2003) PNAS, 100 (14), pp. 8086-8091; Dewey, J., Logic: the theory of inquiry (1986) John Dewey.

This study investigates the spatial-temporal changes of urban green spaces in Beijing and estimates their effects on rainwater runoff reduction based on an empirical model. Results indicate that green spaces in Beijing decreased by 199km2 from 2000 to 2010 and that landscape patches became increasingly isolated and fragmented. The volume of rainwater runoff controlled by urban green spaces first increased and then decreased with the increase in summer rainfall. The runoff reduction rate continuously decreased from 23% in 2000 to 17% in 2010, which is mainly attributed to the composition changes in urban green spaces. In addition, an immense regional difference that is closely related to the changes in the largest patch and aggregation indices of urban green spaces are observed in different regions.

In particular, the roofs of buildings have been identified as a possible field of intervention that could contribute to provide significant energy savings and environmental benefits. In this context, cool and green roofs are two very interesting solutions, which may allow obtaining both the reduction of the energy consumption and the improvement of the comfort sensation in the outdoor and indoor environment.This paper presents a numerical comparative analysis of the energy and environmental performance of three typologies of roof, namely a standard roof (SR), a cool roof (CR) and a green roof (GR). This analysis, developed through dynamic energy simulations under temperate climate, highlights the different thermal behavior for the investigated roof scenarios, also as a function of the level of thermal insulation. Moreover, with the aim to obtain a classification between SR, CR and GR in Mediterranean climate, a scoring system is presented, which considers the whole performance of the investigated roof scenarios under a broad perspective.As a result, it is found that green and cool roofs provide higher energy savings and environmental benefits than highly insulated standard roofs. In particular, scarcely insulated green roofs showed the best performance in relation to the UHI mitigation under the climatic conditions typical of the Mediterranean area. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cool roof;

The standardized monthly rainfall anomaly and large-scale climate indices are first decomposed by using the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) into a certain number of subseries components with different time scales. Then at each time scale, a small and appropriate subset of ANN inputs is identified by the modified partial MI algorithm from a set of candidate subseries components with different lags for forecasting the rainfall anomaly subseries at the corresponding scale. The optimal number of neurons in the hidden layers of ANNs is determined by PSO algorithm, and then each of rainfall anomaly subseries is forecasted from the selected predictor subseries. Finally, the monthly rainfall forecast is achieved by summing all the predicted anomaly subseries and applying the inverse transform of standardized monthly rainfall. The proposed HWNN method is examined with 255 rain gauge stations over Australia, and compared to the reference methods based on the undecomposed time series. The forecasting performance is compared with observed rainfall values, and evaluated by common statistics of relative absolute error and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. The results show that the HWNN model improves the monthly rainfall forecasting accuracy over Australia in comparison to the reference models, and the improvement is more significant for the inland stations in southeast Australia and stations in west Australia. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Forecasting; Monthly rainfall; Mutual information; Particle swarm optimization; Wavelet neural network","Abbot, J., Marohasy, J., Application of artificial neural networks to rainfall forecasting in Queensland, Australia (2012) Adv.

For that reason most countries are adopting various measures to reduce the impact of water scarcity on their agricultural sector and Ghana is no exception. Ghana's agricultural sector is the backbone of the rural economy in the country. The agricultural sector employs about 90 percent of the rural population and contributes extensively to the GDP of the country. But, low productivity and inefficient water use have resulted in a significant threat to the livelihoods of the rural population. The paper used a programing model named MATA (Multi-Analysis Tool for the Agricultural Sector) to achieve the stated objectives. The main objective of the study was to find out the impact of water-pricing policy on the demand for water resources by the farmers in relation to their cropping activities and income. The results of the study indicated that water-pricing policy has a negative impact on the demand for water resources in Ghana. But this impact happens only when water prices are increased significantly. However, if water prices are high it has a negative impact on cropping activities, farmers' income, employment and crop varieties. Hence the study recommends that in order to at least reduce water wastage in the sector, it be proposed that a price (around 2cedi/m3) might be of significance in order to make farmers conscious of the scarcity of water resources, and to persuade them to adopt water saving technologies without affecting crop distribution. The study also recommends that water-pricing policy should not be used as a policy tool on its own but should be used together with other water saving policies in order to achieve the best results. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural policy; Agricultural risk; Economic impact; Irrigated agriculture; Water demand; Water pricing","Abbes, K., Mahjoubi, R., Flichman, G., Impact des formulestarifairesbinÔmessur le systèmeirrigué de la bassevallé de la Medjerda (Tunisie) (2005) Paper presented at the Euro-Mediterranean workshop on ""Les instruments économiqueset la modernisationdespérimètresirrigués"", pp. 21-22; Ahmed, M., Water pricing and marketing in the near east: policy issues and options (2000) Water Policy, 2 (3), pp. 229-242; Berbel, J., Gomez-Limon, J.A., Impact of water pricing policy in Spain: an analysis of three irrigated areas (2000) Agric.

Local effects of vertical movements of OMZ's that result from changes in upwelling intensity could reduce or expand the oxygenated surface layer that most zooplanktonic species inhabit in coastal areas. Using the copepods Calanus chilensis and Acartia tonsa as model organisms, an experimental test of the impact of different dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (between 0.5 and 5mlL-1) on egg production and hatching success was carried out and compared with field estimations of egg production, female and egg abundance in Mejillones Bay (23°S). Abundance of C. chilensis was highly variability and no consistent pattern in egg production and hatching success was found across DO levels, whereas A. tonsa egg production had maximum values between 2.6 and 4.7ml O<inf>2</inf> L-1 and hatching success was positively correlated with DO (r=0.75). In the field, temperature was the main factor controlling the dynamics of both species, while Chl-a and DO were also correlated with C. chilensis and A. tonsa, respectively. Principal Component Analysis showed that abundances of both copepods were controlled by temperature, stratification, OMZ depth, and Ekman transport, which together explained more than 70% of the total variance and were the main factors that modulated the populations of C. chilensis and A. tonsa in the upwelling zone of northern Chile (23°S). The differential responses of C. chilensis and A. tonsa to changes in DO concentrations associated with vertical movements of the OMZ suggest that C. chilensis may be better adapted to hypoxic conditions than A. tonsa, however both species are successful and persistent all year-round. We suggest that physiological responses of copepods could be used to evaluate population dynamics affected by the shoaling of OMZ's and the repercussions to trophic food webs of eastern boundary current systems. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Copepods; Egg production; Hatching success; Humboldt current system; Oxygen minimum zone; Upwelling","Aguilera, V.M., Donoso, K., Escribano, R., Reproductive performance of small-sized dominant copepods with a highly variable food resource in the coastal upwelling system off the Chilean Humboldt Current (2011) Mar.

The program has effectively created a class of energy-intensive enterprises that are regulated by the government for energy conservation purposes. Through an empirical study conducted in Changchun, this paper shows that the adoption of energy efficiency technologies and practices has been highly uneven in this class of enterprises because of two reasons. First, a de facto two-tier regulatory system has emerged within the framework of the Ten-Thousand Enterprises Program. Central state-owned enterprises are closely regulated by the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) which is a central government apparatus, whereas local state-owned enterprises and privately owned enterprises are regulated by the local government, which has fewer resources and incentives to implement the program rigorously. Second, the Ten-Thousand Enterprises Program bundles together different types of enterprises. This approach places smaller enterprises at a disadvantage and limits their ability to conserve energy. © 2015.","China; Climate change mitigation; Energy conservation; Energy-intensive enterprises; Ten-Thousand Enterprises Program","Abdelaziz, E.A., Saidur, R., Mekhilef, S., A review on energy saving strategies in industrial sector (2011) Renew Sust Energ Rev, 15, pp. 150-168; Apeaning, R.W., Thollander, P., Barriers to and driving forces for industrial energy efficiency improvements in African industries-a case study of Ghana's largest industrial area (2013) J Clean Prod, 53, pp. 204-213; Cagno, E., Trianni, A., Exploring drivers for energy efficiency within small- and medium-sized enterprises: First evidences from Italian manufacturing enterprises (2013) Appl Energy, 104, pp. 276-285; Chan, H.S., Politics over markets: Integrating state-owned enterprises into Chinese socialist market (2009) Public Adm Dev, 29, pp. 43-54; Chen, S., Fu, M., Wang, A., Seizing China's energy-efficiency opportunity: A case study (2013) McKinsey Q, pp. 94-99; Dixon, R.K., McGowan, E., Onysko, G., Scheer, R.M., US energy conservation and efficiency policies: Challenges and opportunities (2010) Energy Policy, 38, pp. 6398-6408; Gan, D., Energy service companies to improve energy efficiency in China: barriers and removal measures (2009) Procedia Earth Planet Sci, 1, pp. 1695-1704; Gielen, D., Taylor, P., Indicators for industrial energy efficiency in India (2009) Energy, 34, pp. 962-969; Hang, L., Tu, M., The impacts of energy prices on energy intensity: evidence from China (2007) Energy Policy, 35, pp. 2978-2988; Hrustic, A., Sommarin, P., Thollander, P., Söderström, M., A simplified energy management system towards increased energy efficiency in SMEs (2011) Proceedings of the World Renewable Energy Congress 2011 (WREC 2011), 9-13 May, , Electronic Press, Linköping; Ke, J., Price, L., Ohshita, S., Fridley, D., Khanna, N.Z., Zhou, N., China's industrial energy consumption trends and impacts of the Top-1000 Enterprises Energy-Saving Program and the Ten Key Energy-Saving Projects (2012) Energy Policy, 50, pp. 562-569; Ke, J., Zheng, N., Fridley, D., Price, L., Zhou, N., Potential energy savings and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions reduction of China's cement industry (2012) Energy Policy, 45, pp. 739-751; Kong, L., Price, L., Hasanbeigi, A., Liu, H., Li, J., Potential for reducing paper mill energy use and carbon dioxide emissions through plant-wide energy audits: A case study in China (2013) Appl Energy, 102; Kostka, G., Hobbs, W., Local energy efficiency policy implementation in China: Bridging the gap between national priorities and local interests (2012) China Q, 211, pp. 765-785; Kostka, G., Shin, K., Energy conservation through energy service companies: Empirical analysis from China (2013) Energy Policy, 52, pp. 748-759; Kostka, G., Moslener, U., Andreas, J., Barriers to increasing energy efficiency: evidence from small-and medium-sized enterprises in China (2013) J Clean Prod, 57, pp. 59-68; Li, J., Wang, X., Energy and climate policy in China's twelfth five-year plan: A paradigm shift (2012) Energy Policy, 41, pp. 519-528; Liu, X., Niu, D., Bao, C., Suk, S., Shishime, T., A survey study of energy saving activities of industrial companies in Taicang, China (2012) J Clean Prod, 26, pp. 79-89; Liu, Z., Geng, Y., Lindner, S., Zhao, H., Fujita, T., Guan, D., Embodied energy use in China's industrial sectors (2012) Energy Policy, 49, pp. 751-758; Lo, A.Y., Carbon emissions trading in China (2012) Nat Clim Chang, 2, pp. 765-766; Lo, K., A critical review of China's rapidly developing renewable energy and energy efficiency policies (2014) Renew Sust Energ Rev, 29, pp. 508-516; Lo, K., Wang, M., Energy conservation in China's Twelfth Five-Year Plan period: Continuation or paradigm shift?

Domestic and international disaster-related reports indicate that temporary workers have high risk associated with working environments as a major cause of accidents. We established relationships between the individual and organizational factors that affect temporary workers' safety behaviors using structural equation modeling (SEM). SEM is used to estimate simultaneously the cause-and-effect relationships between many independent variables and dependent variables. A questionnaire was administered to temporary construction workers, and the following results were obtained. First, personal characteristics had a partial effect on job stress and a direct effect on safety culture. Second, personal characteristics and job stress had a direct effect on self-perceived fatigue. Third, personal characteristics and safety culture had a direct effect on safety climate, and personal characteristics also had an indirect effect. Finally, personal characteristics had no direct effect on safety behavior, but did have indirect effects. Job stress had both a direct and indirect effect. Safety culture had no direct effect, but did have an indirect effect. Also, safety climate had a significant direct effect. These findings can be used as preliminary data to develop additional safety programs for temporary construction workers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Korean construction industry; Safety behavior; Structural equation modeling; Temporary construction workers","Ahn, C.K., Chae, J.H., Standardization of the Korean version of the revised NEO personality inventory (1997) Korean J.

Tech. (FCIT), King Abdulaziz University (KAU), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","Throughout the world, there are regions of vast extent that have many favorable features, but whose development is principally limited by the lack of fresh water. In arid areas where large-scale development has already occurred, e.g. parts of the Middle East and North Africa, the extraction of fresh water via desalination plants requires very large energy consumption. This motivates the development of solar-desalination systems, which are desalination systems that are powered by solar energy. With the goal of identifying key technical challenges and potential opportunities solar-desalination, we review a variety of solar energy technologies used for capturing and concentrating heat energy, and also review various technologies for desalination systems including advanced techniques for energy-recovery. Existing solar-powered desalination plants have generally been indirect solar-desalination systems that first (i) transform solar energy into electrical energy and then (ii) employ the resulting electrical energy to drive desalination systems. Other, potentially more efficient direct solar-desalination systems directly convert the solar energy to pressure and/or heat, and use these to directly power the desalination process. We compare the cost-effectiveness, energy-efficiency, and other relevant quantities of these potential technologies for solar-desalination systems. We conclude that the direct solar-desalination systems using solar-thermal collectors appear to be most attractive for optimization of the energy-efficiency of solar-desalination systems. Further, we consider the economics and other practical issues associated with employing solar-desalination systems to provide for economic water sources for urban and agricultural areas. We consider factors that have significant impact to the use of solar-desalination systems: including location, climate, the type of water source (ocean water or brackish water sources), as well as land-use and ecological issues. We observe that the most favorable locations are those with high solar irradiance, lack of fresh water, but access to large brackish water sources and/or proximate seawater. We review the known locations of global brackish water reserves and areas with proximate seawater. Finally, we determine what appear to be the most favorable candidate locations for solar-desalination systems, which include considerable sections of North and East Africa, the Middle East, Southern Europe, Western South America, Australia, Northern Mexico, and South-West USA. We conclude that the development of cost-effective and energy-efficient solar-desalination systems may in the immediate future the key to a future ""terraforming"" of otherwise desert and near-desert regions of the world, providing a ""greening"" of these regions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Satellite soil moisture retrievals and brightness temperature observations, such as those available from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, can be a valuable source of information for data assimilation and merging with other satellite retrieval datasets. To correct for biases in these data sets, bias correction methods such as cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching, linear rescaling and copulas are used to map satellite soil moisture climatology to that of in situ or model values. This study compared SMOS retrievals to soil moisture observations from the SCAN network for a calibration period of 2010-2011 and validation period of 2012-2013 before and after bias correction. The focus of the study was on the presence and removal of multiplicative bias when comparing SMOS retrievals to SCAN data. Additive bias between SMOS retrievals and SCAN observations was removed by standard bias correction techniques and a new resampling approach was found to reduce multiplicative biases. In addition, the new bias correction technique was found very competitive with the benchmark methods for both the calibration and validation periods. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Bias correction; Cumulative distribution function; Renormalization; SMOS; Validation","Al Bitar, A., Leroux, D., Kerr, Y.H., Merlin, O., Richaume, P., Sahoo, A., Evaluation of SMOS soil moisture products over continental U.S. using the SCAN/SNOTEL network (2012) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 50, pp. 1572-1586; Albergel, C., Zakharova, E., Calvet, J.-C., Zribi, M., Pardé, M., Wigneron, J.-P., A first assessment of the SMOS data in southwestern France using in situ and airborne soil moisture estimates: The CAROLS airborne campaign (2011) Remote Sensing of Environment, 115, pp. 2718-2728; Al-Yaari, A., Wigneron, J.-P., Ducharne, A., Kerr, Y., de Rosnay, P., de Jeu, R., Global-scale evaluation of two satellite-based passive microwave soil moisture datasets (SMOS and AMSR-E) with respect to Land Data Assimilation System estimates (2014) Remote Sensing of Environment, 147, pp. 181-195; Bartalis, Z., Wagner, W., Naeimi, V., Hasenauer, S., Scipal, K., Bonekamp, H., Initial soil moisture retrievals from the METOP-A Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) (2007) Geophysical Research Letters, 34, p.

Damage caused by disasters can be prevented or alleviated if sufficient investments are made in a timely manner. However, despite a wide range of investment options and well-developed engineering expertise, port investment on disaster prevention remains a challenging task involving great complexities. This paper develops an integrated economic model for the analysis of disaster-prevention investments at a ""landlord"" port. It simultaneously considers the uncertainty of disaster occurrence and associated return of prevention investments, the information accumulation and related investment timing, and the benefit spillovers of investment among stakeholders. Our analysis shows that the timing of port investments depends on the probability of disasters. Immediate investment is optimal for disasters with very high probability, while investment should be postponed if such a probability is very low. Optimal timing for cases of intermediate probability cannot be determined analytically, as it is influenced by other factors such as discount rate, information accumulation and efficiency of investments. Positive spillovers between a port and its tenants lead to under-investment, which can be corrected by coordination between stakeholders. However, since there are risks of ""overinvestment"" (the marginal benefits of investments are zero ex post if there is no disaster), regulatory intervention is not always optimal when the regulator does not have a good understanding of disaster probability distribution. Therefore, scientific research would bring significant economic and strategic value to policy, planning and investment decisions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Benefit spillover; Disaster prevention; Information accumulation; Investment coordination; Investment timing","Alchian, A.A., Demsetz, H., Production, information costs, and economic organization (1972) American Economic Review, 62 (5), pp. 777-795; Anderson, C.M., Park, Y.A., Chang, Y.T., Yang, C.H., Lee, T.W., Luo, M., A game-theoretic analysis of competition among container port hubs: the case of Busan and Shanghai (2008) Maritime Policy & Management, 35, pp. 5-26; Arrow, K.J., Fisher, A.C., Environmental preservation, uncertainty, and irreversibility (1974) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 88 (1), pp. 312-319; Bae, M.J., Chew, E.P., Zhang, A., Lee, L.H., Container transshipment and port competition (2013) Maritime Policy & Management, 40, pp. 479-494; Barrett, S., Self-enforcing international environmental agreements (1994) Oxford Economic Papers, 46, pp. 878-894; Basso, L.J., Wan, Y., Zhang, A., Seaport Competition, Regional Cooperation and Strategic Investment in Accessibility (2014), Working Paper, Sauder School of Business, University of British ColumbiaBerechman, J., Tseng, P.H., Estimating the environmental costs of port related emissions: the case of Kaohsiung (2012) Transportation Research Part D: Transport and the Environment, 17, pp. 35-38; Cantore, N., Peskett, L., Te Velde, D.W., Climate Negotiations and Development - How can Low-Income Countries Gain from a Climate Negotiation Framework Agreement?

Policymakers have recognized this potential and over the last decade have intensified their efforts towards creating a conducive regulatory and policy framework. Policy instruments such as renewable obligations, feed-in-tariffs and generation based incentives have specially aided the transformation towards large scale generation, enabling higher efficiency and lower costs of generation. However, financing has emerged as a significant barrier for sustaining the momentum gained in recent years. Given this background this paper provides an overview on the evolution of large scale generation and the consequent changes in financing requirements. It further reviews the emerging trends and barriers in the financing landscape and analyses the impact of policy performance in this context.

As the water depth decreases landwards, the base of the hydrate stability zone progressively shallows until hydrate can occur at or immediately below the seabed where an increase in bottom water temperature can cause dissociation. But the true extent of these most vulnerable hydrate deposits is unknown. Here we use exceptional quality three-dimensional (3-D) seismic reflection imagery offshore of Mauritania that reveals a rare example of a bottom simulating reflection (BSR) that intersects the seabed and delineates the feather-edge of hydrate. The BSR intersects the seabed at the ~636 m isobath but along the 32 km of the margin analysed, the intersection is highly irregular. Intersections and seismic evidence for hydrate less than ~4.3 m below the seabed occur in seven small, localised areas that are 0.02-0.45 km2 in extent. We propose gas flux below the dipping base of the hydrate to these places has been particularly effective. The intersections are separated by recessions in the BSR where it terminates below the seabed, seawards of the 636 m isobath. Recessions are areas where the concentration of hydrate is very low or hydrate is absent. They are regions that have been bypassed by gas that has migrated landwards along the base of the hydrate or via hydraulic fractures that pass vertically through the hydrate stability zone and terminate at pockmarks at the seabed. An irregular feather-edge of marine hydrate may be typical of other margins. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Dissociation; Gas; Hydrate; Reflection; Seabed; Warming","Ayan, C., Colley, N., Cowan, G., Ezekwe, E., Wannell, M., Goode, P., Halford, F., Pop, J., Measuring permeability anisotropy: the latest approach (1994) Oilfield Rev., 6, pp. 24-35; Barnes, R.O., Goldberg, E.D., Methane production and consumption in anoxic marine sediments (1976) Geology, 4, pp. 297-300; Ben-Avraham, Z., Smith, G., Reshef, M., Jungslager, E., Gas hydrate and mud volcanoes on the southwest African continental margin off South Africa (2002) Geology, 30, pp. 927-930; Berndt, C., Feseker, T., Treude, T., Krastel, S., Liebetrau, V., Niemann, H., Bertics, V.J., Steinle, L., Temporal constraints on hydrate controlled methane seepage off Svalbard (2014) Science, 343, pp. 284-287; Brown, A., (2010) Interpretation of Three-Dimensional Seismic Data, , Tulsa; Carcione, J.M., Tinivella, U., Bottom-simulating reflectors: seismic velocities and AVO effects (2000) Geophysics, 65, pp. 54-67; Chabert, A., Minshull, T.A., Westbrook, G.K., Berndt, C., Thatcher, K.E., Sarkar, S., Seismic characterisation of gas hydrate and free gas along the western continental margin of Svalbard (2011) J.

Ramón y Cajal s/n (Ciudad Universitaria), Madrid, Spain","Groundwater contamination by nitrate is one of the several environmental problems that may be caused by the application of organic amendments to agricultural soils, and is a key issue in the European Union's environmental policy. The use of predictive tools such as flow and transport models for soluble forms could be helpful for preventing the risk of contamination after the application of organic amendments. We investigated the dynamics of leachable inorganic nitrogen forms (NH<inf>4</inf>+-N and NO<inf>3</inf>--N) produced by a single high-dose application of three different organic amendments (a municipal solid waste compost (MSWC), and aerobically (AES) and anaerobically (ANS) digested sewage sludge) in an agricultural soil over a two-year period and how solutes migrate through the vadose zone under a Mediterranean climate. Although the mineralization process was determined by the type of amendment, seasonal variations led to the release and transformation of leachable inorganic nitrogen forms. Sewage sludge (AES and ANS) treatments provide a higher proportion of soluble nitrogen forms than MSWC treatment, which produces a more stable organic matter. Under our field conditions, pollutants can accumulate in the vadose zone, constituting a time bomb which may lead to aquifer contamination further down the line. Hence an increase in water input would accelerate the migration of pollutants and increase the risk of groundwater contamination. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Leaching risk; Mediterranean climate; MSW compost; Sewage sludge; Soil nitrogen","Abouabdillah, A., Oueslati, O., De Girolamo, A.M., Porto, A.L., Modeling the impact of climate change in a Mediterranean catchment (Merguellil, Tunisia) (2010) Fresenius Environ.

Consequently, an inventory-based discrete-time Markov chain model of the forest resources is coupled with a partial equilibrium model of the market of forest products and with a microeconomic model of allocation of the harvested area to form a national-level forest sector model for France (FFSM++).In this paper, we present the model with emphasis on its spatial aspects, and we show that by only considering environmental heterogeneity and, therefore, the local characteristics of the forest under management, it is possible to realistically model management decisions such as forest investments. In particular, we propose an application that spatialises the forest growth rate, normally reported by inventory sources at the regional level, and we run long-term scenarios (until 2100) in order to simulate the effects on the forest dynamics of a potential increase in coniferous mortality in certain areas due to climate change when interactions between forest management strategies are explicitly considered. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Bio-economic model; Forest mortality; Forest sector modelling; Spatial model","Allen, C.D., Macalady, A.K., Chenchouni, H., Bachelet, D., McDowell, N., Vennetier, M., Kitzberger, T., Cobb, N., A global overview of drought and heat-induced tree mortality reveals emerging climate change risks for forests (2010) For.

Despite its ecological and economic importance, its biological environment is relatively unexplored. Satellite ocean-colour estimates of chlorophyll concentration (an index of phytoplankton biomass) offer an observational platform to monitor the health of the Red Sea. However, little is known about the optical properties of the region. In this paper, we investigate the optical properties of the Red Sea in the context of satellite ocean-colour estimates of chlorophyll concentration. Making use of a new merged ocean-colour product, from the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative, and in situ data in the region, we test the performance of a series of ocean-colour chlorophyll algorithms. We find that standard algorithms systematically overestimate chlorophyll when compared with the in situ data. To investigate this bias we develop an ocean-colour model for the Red Sea, parameterised to data collected during the Tara Oceans expedition, that estimates remote-sensing reflectance as a function of chlorophyll concentration. We used the Red Sea model to tune the standard chlorophyll algorithms and the overestimation in chlorophyll originally observed was corrected. Results suggest that the overestimation was likely due to an excess of CDOM absorption per unit chlorophyll in the Red Sea when compared with average global conditions. However, we recognise that additional information is required to test the influence of other potential sources of the overestimation, such as aeolian dust, and we discuss uncertainties in the datasets used.

Widespread adaptation of solar PV rooftops can also help address climate change issue via lower overall emission of Greenhouse Gases. This paper reviewed the latest situation of solar PV rooftop implementation, expansion and execution strategies in Thailand. The review examined factors impacting adoption rate of solar PV rooftops. Supporting factors include optimum solar radiation intensity, active renewable energy development policy and Feed-In Tariff (FIT). Increasing urbanization rate also resulted in an increase in potential space suitable for solar panel installation. Barriers of solar PV rooftop implementation in Thailand were carefully analyzed. Limitation in domestic technology and technical experiences in manufacturing sector is one of the major barriers inhibiting progress in solar rooftop adoption. In addition, government subsidy and support are still needed for solar PV rooftops to be competitive with other forms of energy generation. Increasing public awareness and reforming of energy and related regulations are necessary to promote meaningful implementation of solar energy in Thailand. To enhance rate of solar PV rooftop installation in Thailand, a short-term strategy could be in a form of providing financial supports such as low interest rate loans, tax credits and development of renewable portfolio standards together with the current FIT scheme. In the longer-term, to achieve grid parity, the government and private sectors need to rely less on financial subsidies and focus on establishing R&D centers to develop and strengthen domestic solar energy industry and introduce cost-effective solar PV solutions. With effective policies and credible solutions with a viable market, public demand in solar rooftop implementation in urban areas will naturally increase and create sustainable progress in solar rooftop industry in Thailand. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The model was forced by Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) winds and ETOPO2 bathymetry data. The highest annual wave power can be found in the northern region of the study area with amplitudes exceeding 20kW/m. The values decrease gradually towards the Sunda Shelf and reach to their minimum at coastal regions due to bathymetry complexity, shadowing and island obstruction effects. However, the wave power is strongly influenced by seasonality and inter-annual fluctuation. Nine sites representing different sub-regions were selected for further analysis on eligibility of wave farming. Various wave energy statistics including estimated electric power for a number of Wave Energy Converter (WEC) devices showed some stations (Hameau Mo in Vietnamese east coast, Spratly Island, Palawan and Cape Bolinao in west coast of Luzon) have greater eligibility for wave power farming.

However, in cotton strip intercropped with wheat, only limited knowledge on yield response to plant density and plant growth regulator i.e. mepiquat chloride (MC) exists. Here we quantified MC and plant density effects on cotton yield components and quality in wheat-cotton relay intercropping by three field experiments in 2010-2012 in Anyang, China. Four plant densities and four MC treatments were applied in different times and dosages. Lint yield significantly increased 40.7% when plant density increased from 3.0 to 7.5plantsm-2, and enhanced 7.9% by applying MC four times compared to MC free control. High densities increased the number of bolls per m2 but decreased single boll weight. Conversely, applying MC generally slightly decreased number of bolls, with the exception of a significant increase by applying MC four times, and increased boll weight. Lint percentage was decreased by applying MC. The yearly climate significantly impacted the effects of applying MC and plant density. Application of MC did not significantly affect cotton fiber length and micronaire, but increased fiber strength. Applying MC in combination with increasing plant density led to harvestable bolls to be located more at low and middle positions on the plant. The increase of boll weight by applying MC was partly resulted from the optimal distribution of harvestable bolls within the canopy. The results help farmers to optimize plant density and MC application in the intercropped cotton. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Boll density; Boll spatial distribution; Boll weight; Harvestable bolls; Lint percentage; Relay strip intercropping","(2001) Guidelines for HVI Testing, Revised July 2001, , United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Marketing Service, Cotton Program, 3275 Appling Road, Memphis, TN 38133; Biles, S.P., Cothren, J.T., Flowering and yield response of cotton to application of mepiquat chloride and PGR-IV (2001) Crop Sci., 41, pp. 1834-1837; Bryman, A., Cramer, D., (1990) Quantitative Data Analysis for Social Scientists, pp. 246-251. , Routledge, New York, NY; Constable, G.A., Mapping the production and survival of fruit on field-grown cotton (1991) Agron.

The optical properties of a mixture of BC and sulfate aerosol particles are considered for three typical bands. The results show that mixing methods, the volume ratio of BC to sulfate, and relative humidity have a strong influence on the optical properties of mixed aerosols. Compared to internal mixing, external mixing underestimates the particle mass absorption coefficient by 20-70% and the particle mass scattering coefficient by up to 50%, whereas it overestimates the particle single scattering albedo by 20-50% in most cases. However, the asymmetry parameter is strongly sensitive to the equivalent particle radius, but is only weakly sensitive to the different mixing methods. Of the internal methods, there is less than 2% difference in all optical properties between the Maxwell-Garnett and Bruggeman methods in all bands; however, the differences between the Core-Shell and Maxwell-Garnett/Bruggeman methods are usually larger than 15% in the ultraviolet and visible bands.A sensitivity test is conducted with the Beijing Climate Center Radiation transfer model (BCC-RAD) using a simulated BC concentration that is typical of east-central China and a sulfate volume ratio of 75%. The results show that the internal mixing methods could reduce the radiative flux more effectively because they produce a higher absorption. The annual mean instantaneous radiative force due to BC-sulfate aerosol is about -3.18W/m2 for the external method and -6.91W/m2 for the internal methods at the surface, and -3.03/-1.56/-1.85W/m2 for the external/Core-Shell/(Maxwell-Garnett/Bruggeman) methods, respectively, at the tropopause. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Aerosol optical properties; Black carbon; External mixing; Internal mixing; Sulfate","Seinfeld, J.H., Pandis, S.N., (2012) Atmospheric chemistry and physics: from air pollution to climate change, , John Wiley & Sons; Boucher, O., Randall, D., Artaxo, P., Bretherton, C., Feingold, G., Forster, P., Clouds and aerosols (2013) Climate Change 2013: the physical science basis.

The organic matter assimilation pathways of benthic organisms, along with food-web structure, were investigated at shelf and slope locations spanning 2000km across the Canadian Arctic using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis. Three potential food sources and over 75 benthic taxa belonging to four feeding guilds were analyzed, but the δ13C end-members for the benthic food-webs could not be clearly discerned. While spatial patterns of δ13C for pelagic particulate organic matter were linked to phytoplankton biomass at the time of sampling, sediment δ13C values reflected the relative composition of terrestrial and marine organic matter. On average, benthic primary consumers were enriched in 13C by 5 and 7‰ compared to the potential organic matter sources sampled in sediment and the water column, respectively. The δ13C discrepancy between identified sources of organic matter and benthic organisms suggests that an uncharacterized food source provided a significant carbon source to these animals. We propose that the 13C enrichment of benthic organisms may be largely caused by the assimilation of ice algae (which were not sampled in this study), particularly in regions of known high ice-algal standing stock such as Barrow Strait and Eclipse Sound. The δ15N values of bottom-water particulate organic matter and of benthic primary consumers increased with depth due to greater degradation of the settling organic material. The δ15N values of secondary consumers did not increase with depth, leading to a decrease of their trophic position compared with shallower regions and likely reflecting an increase in omnivory due to scarcity of prey at depth. This study emphasizes the potential importance of sea-ice algae as a carbon source for benthic communities in the Canadian Arctic and suggests that distinct food-web structures prevail over the shelf and slope. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Arctic; Benthos; Depth; Food web; Sea-ice algae; Stable isotopes","Alou-Font, E., Mundy, C.-J., Roy, S., Gosselin, M., Agusti, S., Snow cover affects ice algal pigment composition in the coastal Arctic Ocean during spring (2013) Mar.
