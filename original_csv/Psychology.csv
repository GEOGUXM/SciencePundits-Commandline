My paper in memoriam to Rudolph Binion is intended as both a retrospective and an introspective account of my relationship with him, as he had a pivotal influence on me when he was my professor at Columbia University. His help and influence continued after I left graduate school. In my paper I also deal with the enormous stresses of navigating through graduate school, for those students whose goal was to earn the Ph.D. degree. Some examinations were dreaded, For Example The ""Examination in Subjects,"" popularly called the ""Oral Exam."" The ""incubation"" period was long indeed, frequently averaging nearly ten years, and it was an ordeal, as the rate of attrition was very high. There is then also the question of ""ego strength"" and that of ""transference"" toward the professor. Graduate school is indeed a long and strenuous challenge. I took a seminar in modern French history, a requirement for the Master's degree with Professor Binion, which was consequential for me, as he taught me to be objective in writing history. Professor Binion was a demanding and outstanding teacher.",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925580977

Three groups were examined: eminent American writers, presidents of the USA, and the 100 Americans who were judged by Life magazine to have been the most influential in 20th century society. Bereavement was common in the childhoods of these outstanding individuals, but was also high, or even higher, for those individuals who achieved somewhat less eminence (less successful writers, and presidential also-rans). More than half the total set of the presidents and also-rans were orphans. Eminent Americans showed substantial although lower levels of parental loss, and nearly three-quarters had experienced difficult childhoods that were marked by some form of loss. Eminent Americans, like the presidents, tended to be first-borns; they also showed elevated levels of divorce, suicide, and name changing. The results provide support for the Phaeton theory, but suggest that the child's struggle to overcome other losses than bereavement may also promote eminence, as may the presence of significant mentors.",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925581710

Patients completed a standardized pain questionnaire and psychometric tests. Differences between smokers and nonsmokers were evaluated using independent samples t tests and chi-square tests. Hierarchical linear multiple regression models were used to examine predictors of sleep disturbances.RESULTS: Of the entire sample, 170 (32%) reported that they were smokers. Smokers reported higher pain severity and more sleep disturbances and psychological distress than nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking significantly predicted sleep disturbance (β = 0.229, P < .001), but this relationship was attenuated after controlling for pain severity and psychological distress (β = 0.122, P < .001).CONCLUSION: Cigarette smoking is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, including pain severity, alterations in mood, and disrupted sleep, and seems to be a significant predictor of sleep quality in patients with masticatory myofascial pain.",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925283315

The current studies were designed to use texting to promote positive communication between romantic partners with the hope to enhance relationship satisfaction. In two studies, the authors experimentally manipulated the content of the first messages that participants sent out to their romantic partner everyday for two weeks. Participants' satisfaction was assessed at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the study. The partners, who were unaware of their partner's involvement in the study, were contacted at the end of the study and reported their satisfaction. The experimental conditions in Study 1 did not show statistically significant differences in their relationship happiness trajectory over the two weeks from the control condition, possibly due to the fact that participants sent out scripted texts provided by the researchers. In Study 2 the experimental groups wrote their own texts following instructions provided by the researchers. All experimental conditions showed a significantly different satisfaction trajectory compared to the control condition. However, partner satisfaction did not respond to the texting manipulation in either study.","College students; Communication; Positive psychology; Romantic relationship satisfaction; Texting","Amato, P.R., Booth, A., The legacy of parents' marital discord: Consequences for children's marital quality (2001) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81, pp. 627-638; Arriaga, X.B., The ups and downs of dating: Fluctuations in satisfaction in newly formed romantic relationships (2001) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 80, pp. 754-765; Barnes, S., Brown, K.W., Krusemark, E., Campbell, W.K., Rogge, R.D., The role of mindfulness in romantic relationship satisfaction and responses to relationship stress (2007) Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, 33 (4), pp. 482-500; Baumeister, R.F., Bratslavsky, E., Passion, intimacy, and time: Passionate love as a function of change in intimacy (1999) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 3, pp. 49-67; Bryant, A.J., Sanders-Jackson, A., Smallwood, A.K., IMing, text messaging, and adolescent social networks (2006) Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 11, pp. 577-592; Carrere, S., Gottman, J., Predicting divorce among newlyweds from the first three minutes of a marital conflict discussion (1999) Family Process, 38 (3), pp. 293-301; Fincham, F.D., Beach, S.R.H., Marriage in the new millennium: A decade in review (2010) Journal of Marriage and Family, 72, pp. 630-649; Gable, S.L., Gonzaga, G., Strachman, A., Will you be there for me when things go right?

Specifically, they found that mental toughness predicted directed forgetting, which measures peoples' ability to forget things on purpose. We explored the relationships between the short form of the mental toughness scale (the MT-18), other personality traits (the Big Five and BIS/BAS), and directed forgetting. The correlation between mental toughness and directed forgetting replicated. Including a control group with no forget instruction ruled out sustained effort on memory tasks as an explanation; it was specific to directed forgetting. However, mental toughness was shown to correlate with many other personality characteristics, and its effects on directed forgetting were largely due to conscientiousness. We concluded that the basis of mental toughness was probably not inhibitory control as the original authors had proposed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Big Five; Context-change; Directed forgetting; Inhibition; Memory; Mental toughness; Reinforcement sensitivity theory","Avila, C., Parcet, M.A., Personality and inhibitory deficits in the stop-signal task: The mediating role of Gray's anxiety and impulsivity (2001) Personality and Individual Differences, 31, pp. 975-986; Bäuml, K.-H., Pastötter, B., Hanslmayr, S., Binding and inhibition in episodic memory: Cognitive, emotional, and neural processes (2010) Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 34, pp. 1047-1054; Bjork, R.A., Positive forgetting: The noninterference of items intentionally forgotten (1970) Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 9, pp. 255-268; Bjork, E., Bjork, R.A., Anderson, M.C., Varieties of goal-directed forgetting (1998) Intentional forgetting: Interdisciplinary approaches, pp. 103-137. , Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers, Mahwah, NJ, US, J.M.

There is a growing consensus that JME is associated with abnormal function of diffuse brain networks, typically affecting frontal and fronto-thalamic areas. Methods Using diffusion MRI and a graph theoretical analysis, we examined bivariate (network-based statistic) and multivariate (global and local) properties of structural brain networks in patients with JME (N = 34) and matched controls. Neuropsychological assessment was performed in a subgroup of 14 patients. Results Neuropsychometry revealed impaired visual memory and naming in JME patients despite a normal full scale IQ (mean = 98.6). Both JME patients and controls exhibited a small world topology in their white matter networks, with no significant differences in the global multivariate network properties between the groups. The network-based statistic approach identified one subnetwork of hyperconnectivity in the JME group, involving primary motor, parietal and subcortical regions. Finally, there was a significant positive correlation in structural connectivity with cognitive task performance. Conclusions Our findings suggest that structural changes in JME patients are distributed at a network level, beyond the frontal lobes. The identified subnetwork includes key structures in spike wave generation, along with primary motor areas, which may contribute to myoclonic jerks. We conclude that analyzing the affected subnetworks may provide new insights into understanding seizure generation, as well as the cognitive deficits observed in JME patients. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.","Diffusion; Epilepsy; Graph theory; MRI; Neuropsychology; Structural connectivity","Basser, P.J., Pajevic, S., Pierpaoli, C., Duda, J., Aldroubi, A., In vivo fiber tractography using DT-MRI data (2000) Magn.

A cross-sectional design was employed to compare psychopathy scores of business and psychology students, as well as to examine the psychopathy-academic success relationship. Participates were 263 participants recruited from a UK university. Results revealed greater psychopathic traits in business students relative to psychology students on all four factors of psychopathy. Furthermore, hierarchical multiple regression indicated that the four psychopathy factors, gender, age, study hours, and course explain 14% of variance in grade outcome. Two variables made unique statistic contributions to the model with antisocial behaviour and gender (male) negatively related to grade outcome.

One of the core issues involved is that of who rates subjects' personality traits in studies. The present studies (. N=. 135 in Study 1, N=. 232 in Study 2) surpassed the examinations performed in previous studies by obtaining information regarding one of the key personality traits, preference for competition, using a framework developed via experimental economics rather than subjective ratings. Despite the fact that the two studies involved different types of task, we consistently observed that older sisters exerted a significant impact on their younger siblings in both studies. In particular, having an older sister was negatively associated with men's competitive preferences. We also obtained suggestive evidence that having an older sister was positively associated with women's competitive preferences.

We systematically integrated the three levels of organization, employee, and customer to investigate how servant leadership stimulates CVC through the key mediating roles of the positive psychological capital (PPC) and service-oriented organizational citizenship behavior (SOOCB) of employees. Hierarchical linear models were adopted for cross-level analyses, targeting 30 hotels in Taiwan. A total of 650 questionnaires was distributed, and 493 valid questionnaires were retrieved. This study provided three major contributions: (a) This study asserted that servant leadership can systematically stimulate CVC. (b) We shifted the discussions on CVC to the hotel industry, verifying that PPC and SOOCB play the key mediating roles.

This study examined the potential mediating role of emotion regulation difficulties in the relation between attachment insecurity and binge eating among this population. Participants were 1388 adult pre-bariatric surgery candidates from an accredited bariatric surgery assessment centre in Toronto, Ontario. Participants completed measures of psychological functioning, including attachment style and emotion regulation. Mediation analyses revealed that difficulties with emotion regulation mediated a positive association between insecure-anxious attachment and binge eating. An insecure-avoidant attachment was found to have a non-significant association with binge eating when examining the total effect. However, when difficulties with emotion regulation were controlled for in the model to examine its role as a mediator, this association became significant, and emotion regulation difficulties also mediated the relationship between attachment avoidance and binge eating. These findings suggest that difficulties in emotion regulation may be an important clinical issue to address in order to reduce binge eating in adult bariatric surgery candidates. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bariatric surgery; Binge eating; Emotion regulation; Insecure attachment","Aarts, F., Hinnen, C., Gerdes, V.E., Acherman, Y., Brandjes, D.P., Coping style as a mediator between attachment and mental and physical health in patients suffering from morbid obesity (2014) International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine, 47 (1), pp. 75-91; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research.

Novel, epigenetic data suggest that maternal dietary intake has permanent phenotypic consequences for offspring, highlighting the potency of antenatal diet. To date, the relationship between poor antenatal diet and maternal mental health specifically, remains poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review evidence that has examined associations between antenatal diet quality and the experience of depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms during the perinatal period. Methods: A search for peer-reviewed papers was conducted using Medline Complete, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Academic Search Premiere and Psychology and Behavioral Science Collection. Results: Nine studies (cohort = 4, cross-sectional = 5) published between 2005 and 2013 were eligible for inclusion in this review. A synthesis of findings revealed positive associations between poor quality and unhealthy diets and antenatal depressive and stress symptoms. Healthy diets were inversely associated with antenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms. Postnatal depressive symptoms demonstrated inconsistent results. Conclusions: Given the paucity of research examining diet quality and mental health in women during the perinatal period, further sufficiently powered studies are urgently required to examine this association. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Anxiety; Depression; Maternal diet; Perinatal; Stress; Systematic review","Barker, E.D., Kirkham, N., Ng, J., Jensen, S.K.G., Prenatal maternal depression symptoms and nutrition, and child cognitive function (2013) The British Journal of Psychiatry: The Journal of Mental Science, 203, pp. 417-421; Blunden, C.H., Inskip, H.M., Robinson, S.M., Cooper, C., Godfrey, K.M., Kendrick, T.R., Postpartum depressive symptoms.

Categorising self-harm simply by a method may be clinically misleading because many hospital-attending patients switch from one method of harm to another on subsequent episodes. The study set out to determine the frequency, pattern, determinants and characteristics of method-switching in self-harm episodes presenting to the general hospital. Methods The pattern of repeated self-harm was established from over 33,000 consecutive self-harm episodes in a multicentre English cohort, categorising self-harm methods as poisoning, cutting, other injury, and combined methods. Results Over an average of 30 months of follow-up, 23% of people repeated self-harm and one-third of them switched method, often rapidly, and especially where the person was male, younger, or had self-harmed previously. Self-poisoning was far less likely than other methods to lead on to switching. Limitations Self-harm episodes that do not lead to hospital attendance are not included in these findings but people who self-harmed and went to hospital but were not admitted from the emergency department to the general hospital, or did not receive designated psychosocial assessment are included. People in the study were a mix of prevalent as well as incident cases. Conclusions Method of self-harm is fluctuating and unpredictable. Clinicians should avoid false assumptions about people's risks or needs based simply on the method of harm. Crown Copyright © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J. Clin. Psychiatry, 69, (4), 597-602). Rumination is a cognitive mechanism found to exacerbate and maintain both PTSD and MDD (Elwood et al.; 2009. Clin. Psychol. Rev. 29, (1), 87-100; Olatunji et al.; 2013. Clin. Psychol.: Sci. Pract. 20, (3), 225-257). Aims Assess whether four rumination subtypes moderate the relationship between comorbid PTSD and MDD symptoms. Method We consecutively sampled patients (N=45) presenting to a mental health clinic using self-report measures of PTSD and MDD symptoms, and rumination in a cross-sectional design. Results Repetitive rumination moderates the relationship between PTSD and MDD symptoms at one standard deviation above the mean (β=.044, p=.016), while anticipatory rumination moderates the relationship between PTSD and MDD symptoms at mean levels and higher levels of anticipatory rumination (mean β=.030, p=.042; higher β=.060, p=.008). Discussion Repetitive and anticipatory rumination should be assessed in the context of comorbid PTSD and MDD and interventions should focus on reducing these rumination subtypes. Limitations Results should be replicated with other trauma populations because the number and complexity of traumatic events may impact the assessed symptoms. Constructs should also be assessed longitudinally, in order to establish causality. We are unable to confirm why rumination styles moderated the relationship between PTSD and depression or why counterfactual thinking and problem-focused thinking did not moderate the relationship between the two constructs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In order to illuminate dynamical aspects of the longitudinal course of the illness, we propose here a novel complex model based on the notion of competition between recurrent maps, which mathematically represent the dynamics of activation in excitatory (Glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) pathways. We assume that manic and depressive states can be considered stable sub attractors of a dynamical system through which the mood trajectory moves. The model provides a theoretical framework which can account for a number of complex phenomena of bipolar disorder, including intermittent transition between the two poles of the disorder, rapid and ultra-rapid cycling of episodes and manicogenic effects of antidepressants. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Bipolar disorder; Chaotic intermittency; Recurrent map; Winnerless competition","Afraimovich, V., Tristan, I., Huerta, R., Rabinovich, M.I., Winnerless competition principle and prediction of the transient dynamics in a Lotka-Volterra model (2008) Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science, 18, p. 043103; Anand, A., Li, Y., Wang, Y., Lowe, M.J., Dzemidzic, M., Resting state corticolimbic connectivity abnormalities in unmedicated bipolar disorder and unipolar depression (2009) Psychiatry Res.: Neuroimaging, 171, pp. 189-198; Angeli, D., Ferrell, J.E., Sontag, E.D., Detection of multistability, bifurcations, and hysteresis in a large class of biological positive-feedback systems (2004) Proc.

In line with the time-based resource-sharing model of working memory (TBRS; Barrouillet and Camos, 2015; Barrouillet et al., 2004), there is accumulating evidence that, when memory items have to be maintained while performing a concurrent activity, memory performance depends on the cognitive load of this activity, independently of the domain involved. The present study used fMRI to identify regions in the brain that are sensitive to variations in cognitive load in a domain-general way. More precisely, we aimed at identifying brain areas that activate during maintenance of memory items as a direct function of the cognitive load induced by both verbal and spatial concurrent tasks. Results show that the right IFJ and bilateral SPL/IPS are the only areas showing an increased involvement as cognitive load increases and do so in a domain general manner. When correlating the fMRI signal with the approximated cognitive load as defined by the TBRS model, it was shown that the main focus of the cognitive load-related activation is located in the right IFJ. The present findings indicate that the IFJ makes domain-general contributions to time-based resource-sharing in working memory and allowed us to generate the novel hypothesis by which the IFJ might be the neural basis for the process of rapid switching. We argue that the IFJ might be a crucial part of a central attentional bottleneck in the brain because of its inability to upload more than one task rule at once. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..","Cognitive control; Cognitive load; FMRI; IFJ; Working memory","Baayen, R.H., Piepenbrock, R., Van Rijn, H., (1993) The CELEX Lexical Database (CD-ROM), , Linguistic Data Consortium, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; Baddeley, A.D., Hitch, G., Working memory (1974) Recent Advances in Learning and Motivation, 8, pp. 647-667. , Academic Press, New York; Barrouillet, P., Camos, V., As time goes by: temporal constraints in working memory (2012) Curr.

These research articles were drawn from three social science disciplines (i.e., applied linguistics, education, and psychology) and two research paradigms (i.e., quantitative and qualitative research). Quantitative analyses showed that the applied linguistics and education research articles used boosters more frequently than the psychology research articles. Furthermore, the applied linguistics subcorpus deployed more reader references but fewer self-mentions than the psychology subcorpus. Cross-paradigmatic comparisons revealed that the quantitative research articles made more frequent use of hedges, boosters, attitude markers, engagement markers as a main type, and directives as a subtype than the qualitative research articles. Qualitative analyses identified additional cross-disciplinary and cross-paradigmatic differences in the choice or function of specific metadiscoursal resources. These observed differences are attributable to the knowledge-knower structures characteristic of the disciplines and the epistemologies underlying the research paradigms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Applied linguistics; Education; Interactional metadiscourse; Psychology; Qualitative research; Quantitative research","Abdi, R., Interpersonal metadiscourse: An indicator of interaction and identity (2002) Discourse Studies, 4, pp. 139-145; Abdollahzadeh, E., Poring over the findings: Interpersonal authorial engagement in applied linguistics papers (2011) Journal of Pragmatics, 43, pp. 288-297; Aguilar, M., (2008) Metadiscourse in academic speech: A relevance-theoretic approach, , Peter Lang, Bern, Switzerland; Alise, M.A., Teddlie, C., Acontinuation of the paradigm wars?

Slow life history traits, conscientiousness and agreeableness, were linked to preferences for long-term niches whereas, fast life history traits, narcissism and dishonesty, were linked to preferences for short-term mating niches. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Evolutionary psychology; Individual differences; Mating; Personality; Sex differences","Ashton, M.C., Lee, K., The HEXACO-60: A short measure of the major dimensions of personality (2009) Journal of Personality Assessment, 91, pp. 340-345; Benet-Martinez, V., John, O.P., Los Cinco Grandes across cultures and ethnic groups: Multitrait-multimethod matrix analyses of the Big Five in Spanish and English (1998) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 75, pp. 729-750; Buss, D.M., Selection, evocation, and manipulation (1987) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53, pp. 1214-1221; Buss, D.M., Toward a psychology of person-environment (PE) correlation: The role of spouse selection (1984) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 47, pp. 361-377; Buss, D.M., Schmitt, D.P., Sexual strategies theory: An evolutionary perspective on human mating (1993) Psychological Review, 100, pp. 204-232; Calabuig, G., Ortego, J., Cordero, P.J., Aparicio, M., Causes, consequences and mechanisms of breeding dispersal in the colonial lesser kestrel, Falco naumanni (2008) Animal Behaviour, 76, pp. 1989-1996; Campbell, W.K., Campbell, S.M., On the self-regulatory dynamics created by the peculiar benefits and costs of narcissism: A contextual reinforcement model and examination of leadership (2009) Self & Identity, 8, pp. 214-232; Campbell, W.K., Foster, C.A., Narcissism and commitment in romantic relationships: An investment model analysis (2002) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 28, pp. 484-495; Campbell, W.K., Foster, C.A., Finkel, E.J., Does self-love lead to love for others?: A story of narcissistic game playing (2002) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83, pp. 340-354; Campbell, W.K., Reeder, G.D., Sedikides, C., Elliot, A.J., Narcissism and comparative self-enhancement strategies (2000) Journal of Research in Personality, 34, pp. 329-347; Casler, K., Bickel, L., Hackett, E., Separate but equal?

Previous studies have established the activation of this system when exposed to explicit competition or cooperation between individuals. In the current studies we examine if shared political opinions produce these same effects. In particular, (1) if participants will spontaneously categorize individuals according to the parties they support, even when explicit cooperation and antagonism are absent, and (2) if party support is sufficiently powerful to decrease participants' categorization by an orthogonal but typically-diagnostic alliance cue (in this case the target's race). Evidence was found for both: Participants spontaneously and implicitly kept track of who supported which party, and when party cross-cut race-such that the race of targets was not predictive of party support-categorization by race was dramatically reduced. To verify that these results reflected the operation of a cognitive system for modifying the activation of alliance categories, and not just socially-relevant categories in general, an identical set of studies was also conducted with in which party was either crossed with sex or age (neither of which is predicted to be primarily an alliance category). As predicted, categorization by party occurred to the same degree, and there was no reduction in either categorization by sex or by age. All effects were replicated across two sets of between-subjects conditions. These studies provide the first direct empirical evidence that party politics engages the mind's systems for detecting alliances and establish two important social categorization phenomena: (1) that categorization by age is, like sex, not affected by alliance information and (2) that political contexts can reduce the degree to which individuals are represented in terms of their race. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Coalitional Psychology; Evolutionary Psychology; Partisanship; Politics; Race","Aarøe, L., Petersen, M.B., Hunger games fluctuations in blood glucose levels influence support for social welfare (2013) Psychological science, 24 (12), pp. 2550-2556; Aldrich, J.H., (1995) Why parties?

This paper seeks to address this gap by exploring one researcher's emotional entanglements with her research project, within the context of return from long term travel. These entanglements are discussed in terms of their effect on the researcher personally (including her 'unravelling' of the entanglements through poetry) and their effect on the research process itself, particularly regarding issues of representation, authority, power and balance of voice.

However, little is known about the social-cognitive correlates of sedentary behavior. The purpose of this study was to provide preliminary evidence for the factor structure and composition of sedentary derived Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) constructs and to determine the utility of these constructs in predicting sedentary intention and sedentary time. Method: Twenty-three items were created to assess attitudes, subjective norms (SN), perceived behavioral control (PBC), and intention with respect to time spent being sedentary. Using a web-based survey, 372 adults completed a modified Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire and were then randomised to one of three TPB questionnaire packages: general, weekday, and weekend. Weekday and weekend participants completed items for work/school (less-volitional) and leisure/recreation (volitional) activities separately, resulting in five TPB models being analyzed: general, weekday work/school, weekday leisure/recreation, weekend work/school, and weekend leisure/recreation. Results: Irrespective of model, items grouped into coherent factors consistent with TPB and explained 9-58% and 8-43% of the variance in intention and behavior, respectively. The strongest and most consistent predictor of intention and behavior were SN and intentions, respectively. Mediation analyses indicated that attitudes consistently affected sedentary time through intention. Conclusions: There is growing evidence that the TPB is a useful framework for understanding sedentarism. © 2015 .","Attitude; Health psychology; Intention; Sedentary behavior; Subjective norm; Theory of Planned Behavior","Ajzen, I., From intention to actions: a theory of planned behavior (1985) Action-control: From cognition to behavior, pp. 11-39. , Springer, Heidelberg, J.

However, the socio-cultural and discursive contexts which shape experiences remain largely unexplored in the transition literature. Objective: To explore retirement and transition difficulties in a cultural context through an analysis of Australian newsprint media. Design and methods: A discursive analysis of 121 media articles reporting on post-retirement experiences of two Australian swimmers 7 and 5 years (respectively) into retirement. Data were analysed for repeated representation of transition difficulties, specifically how the cause of difficulties was attributed. The identities that were ascribed to athletes and what these functioned to accomplish were also examined. Results: The identities of both individuals were repeatedly constructed in terms of an athlete identity, to the exclusion of other identities. The responsibility for transition difficulties was depicted as located solely within the individual and, thereby, the sport setting and the broader socio-cultural context were overlooked. Conclusions: In this cultural context (Australian news media), the repeated construction of limited identity positions for retired athletes and the construction of former athletes as the sole locus of transition difficulties have implications for their psychological well-being. Despite this, the role of the sporting and cultural context is rendered invisible in these accounts and more broadly, and interventions remain targeted at the individual level. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Career transition; Discursive psychology; Elite athlete; Identity; Mass media; Transition difficulties","Abell, J., Stokoe, E.H., Broadcasting the royal role: constructing culturally situated identities in the Princess Diana Panorama interview (2001) British Journal of Social Psychology, 40 (3), pp. 417-435; Antaki, C., Widdicombe, S., Identity as an achievement and as a tool (1998) Identities in talk, pp. 1-14. , Sage Publications, London, C.

Ongoing clinical and research efforts have attempted to address the struggles faced by youth and adults with diabetes. Recent research supports the integration of behavioral interventions into clinical practice to assist patients and families with the goal of improving health outcomes. Empirically supported and well-documented behavioral learning principles, particularly positive reinforcement, are often underutilized in modern diabetes care. We posit that most diabetes care providers are aware of these principles. However, the constraints of today’s medical systems have become significant barriers to purposefully and consistently applying them to promote improved diabetes care. We provide a brief overview of basic behavioral principles and common barriers to implementation, discuss relevant interventions, and present several examples of applications in clinical settings. We conclude with recommendations to raise awareness regarding the importance of consistently integrating relevant behavioral learning principles and interventions into diabetes care settings. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Behavior; Diabetes; Healthcare; Learning; Psychology","Gil, G., Nayak, A.U., Wilkins, J., Hankey, J., Raffeeq, P., Varughese, G.I., Challenges of emerging adulthood-transition from paediatric to adult diabetes (2014) World J Diabetes, 5, pp. 630-635; Kurtz, S.M.S., Adherence to diabetes regimens: empirical status and clinical applications (1990) Diabetes Educ, 16, pp. 50-56. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK3c7otlOjtg%3D%3D, PID: 2178896; Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group, Effect of intensive diabetes treatment on the development and progression of long-term complications in adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: diabetes control and complications trial (1994) J Pediatr, 125, pp. 177-188; Benjamin, R.M., Medication adherence: helping patients take their medicines as directed (2012) Public Health Rep, 127, pp. 2-3. , PID: 22298918; Avoidable costs in U.S (2013) health care, , http://www.imshealth.com/deployedfiles/imshealth/Global/Content/Corporate/IMS%20Institute/RUOM-2013/IHII_Responsible_Use_Medicines_2013.pdf; Lewis, A., Noncompliance: a $100 billion problem (1997) Remington Rep, 5, pp. 14-15; Renders, C.M., Valk, G.D., Griffin, S.J., Wagner, E., van Eijk, J.T., Assendelft, W.J.J., Interventions to improve the management of diabetes mellitus in primary care, outpatient, and community settings (Review) (2009) The Cochrane Collaboration: John Wiley & Sons; Kaplan, S.H., Greenfield, S., Ware, J.E., Jr., Assessing the effects of physician-patient interactions on the outcomes of chronic disease (1989) Med Care, 27, pp. 110-127. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaL1M7lvVeitw%3D%3D, PID: 2646486; Stewart, M.A., Effective physician-patient communication and health outcomes: a review (1995) CMAJ, 152, pp. 1423-1433. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK2M3ksF2mug%3D%3D, PID: 7728691; Roter, D.L., Hall, J.A., Merisca, R., Effectiveness of interventions to improve patient compliance (1998) Med Care, 36, pp. 1138-1161. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK1cznt1aqsQ%3D%3D, PID: 9708588; Graber, A.L., Davidson, P., Brown, A.W., McRae, J.R., Wooldridge, K., Dropout and relapse during diabetes care (1992) Diabetes Care, 15, pp. 1477-1483. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK3s7gsFOmtQ%3D%3D, PID: 1468274; Dunbar, J.M., Marshall, G.D., Hovell, M.F., Behavioral strategies for improving compliance (1979) Compliance in health care, , Haynes RB, Taylor DW, Sackett DC, (eds), The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore:; Shelton, J.L., Levy, R.L., (1981) Behavioral assignment and treatment compliance: a handbook of clinical strategies, , Research Press, Champaign, Illinois:; Fisher, L., Glasgow, R.E., A call for more effectively integrating behavioral and social science principles into comprehensive diabetes care (2007) Diabetes Care, 30, pp. 2746-2749. , PID: 17901532; Glasgow, R.E., Hiss, R.G., Anderson, R.M., Friedman, N.M., Hayward, R.A., Marrero, D.G., Report of the health care delivery work group: behavioral research related to the establishment of a chronic disease model for diabetes care (2001) Diabetes Care, 24, pp. 124-130. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD3MzgtVantQ%3D%3D, PID: 11194217; Glasgow, R.E., Fisher, E.B., Anderson, B.J., LaGreca, A., Marrero, D., Johnson, S.B., Behavioral science in diabetes: contributions and opportunities (1999) Diabetes Care, 22, pp. 832-843. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK1M3msFSqtw%3D%3D, PID: 10332691; Watson, J., Psychology as the behaviorist views it (1913) Psychol Rev, 20, pp. 158-177; Watson, J., (1928) The ways of behaviorism, , Harper & Brothers Pub, New York:; Skinner, B.F., (1938) The behavior of organisms: an experimental analysis, , Appleton-Century, New York:; Thorndike, E.L., (1905) The elements of psychology, , A.G.

Tacrine causes dose-related liver toxicity in different species, and its manufacture for human use was recently discontinued. This study was conducted to further characterize its actions on cocaine reward. Cocaine-experienced animals that had no contact with drug over one week resumed self-administration at levels similar to their initial baseline. When tacrine was administered over four days which were preceded and followed by washout periods to allow elimination of cocaine and tacrine respectively, subsequent cocaine self-administration was attenuated by more than one-half. Tacrine administered at 10 mg/kg-day as a chronic infusion by osmotic pump did not modify cocaine-induced increases in locomotor activity or conditioned-place preference. In rats that exhibited persistent attenuation of cocaine-self-administration after receiving tacrine, cocaine-induced reinstatement was also attenuated. No changes in plasma measures of renal or hepatic function were observed in rats receiving tacrine. In conclusion, pretreatment with tacrine can decrease cocaine-motivated behavior measured by self-administration or reinstatement, but not conditioned-place preference. Reductions in cocaine self-administration following pretreatment with tacrine do not require direct interaction with cocaine and are not secondary to either liver or kidney toxicity. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Acetylcholine; Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors; Cocaine; Liver toxicity; Reinforcement (psychology); Reward; Self-administration; Tacrine","Weiss, F., Martin-Fardon, R., Ciccocioppo, R., Kerr, T.M., Smith, D.L., Ben Shahar, O., Enduring resistance to extinction of cocaine-seeking behavior induced by drug-related cues (2001) Neuropsychopharm, 25, pp. 361-372; Grimm, J.W., Shaham, Y., Hope, B.T., Effect of cocaine and sucrose withdrawal period on extinction behavior, cue-induced reinstatement, and protein levels of the dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase in limbic and cortical areas in rats (2002) Behav.

Using the data from mandatory information disclosure of antibiotic prescription rates for the common cold in Korea, this paper shows that while average prescription rates decreased after the disclosure, more than 30% of the clinics increased their antibiotic prescriptions. Moreover, clinics that were prescribing relatively fewer antibiotics than other local clinics before the disclosure requirement were more likely to increase their prescription rate. The average prescription rates also declined less in markets with stronger clinic competition.

Despite extensive research there remains uncertainty as to whether two electrophysiological markers of cognitive control, the N2 and P3, are better conceptualised as markers of response inhibition or response conflict. The present study aimed to directly compare the effects of response inhibition and response conflict on the N2 and P3 event-related potentials, within-subjects. Method: A novel hybrid go/no-go flanker task was performed by 19 healthy adults aged 18-25. years while EEG data were collected. The response congruence of a central target stimulus and 4 flanking stimuli was manipulated between trials to vary the degree of response conflict. Response inhibition was required on a proportion of trials. N2 amplitude was measured at two frontal electrode sites; P3 amplitude was measured at 4 midline electrode sites. Results: N2 amplitude was greater on incongruent than congruent trials but was not enhanced by response inhibition when the stimulus array was congruent. P3 amplitude was greater on trials requiring response inhibition; this effect was more pronounced at frontal electrodes. P3 amplitude was also enhanced on incongruent compared with congruent trials. Discussion: The findings support a role for N2 amplitude as a marker of response conflict and for the frontal shift of the P3 as a marker of response inhibition. This paradigm could be applied to clinical groups to help clarify the precise nature of impaired action control in disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder; Event-related potentials; N2; P3; Response conflict; Response inhibition","Arnsten, A.F.T., Rubia, K., Neurobiological circuits regulating attention, cognitive control, motivation, and emotion: Disruptions in neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders (2012) Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 51 (4), pp. 356-367; Barry, R.J., Johnstone, S.J., Clarke, A.R., A review of electrophysiology in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: II.

The isobenefit lines shown translate cities into benefit landscapes, subjective and continually changeable according to personal moods/needs/preferences and urban transformations. They read attractiveness and how they flow throughout the city. Doing it for each urban point and for each urban attraction, we obtain the isobenefit orography of the city, namely a map of its urban attractions and of their flows. This is a liquid surface rather than solid, as it varies across time and people. It is in this liquidness where resides the complexity of cities, their bottom-up spirit and the dynamicity of equilibriums and networks. People do not necessarily go in the most accessible points, but where they need and want to, and, they flow through paths they need or choose to pass through. It is also introduced the likeability of places and paths: in addition to the usual parameters currently used - which weight distances in terms of physical distance, cost, time or mental easiness representations - psycho-economical distances used in the isobenefit lines proposed here, also consider how a place and a path pleases us. According to the Underground Hedonic Theory, this pleasure to pass through or to stay in agreeable areas has an underground and an inertia effect too which contributes to delight our lives. The final purpose of the science of cities and urban design is to understand cities and make them efficient and attractive to please our lives in them. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Complexity and cities; Isobenefit lines; Science of cities; Space syntax; Urban modeling; Urban quality of life","Anton, H., (1992) Multivariable calculus, , Wiley, USA; Batty, M., Marshall, S., The origins of complexity theory in cities and planning (2012) Complexity theories of cities have come of age, , Springer, Heidelberg, Dordrecht/London, New York, J.

Method In Study One, 489 participants completed a survey on food choice and habits, including questions that asked participants to self-identify as picky eaters. Picky and non-picky eaters were compared on their rates of endorsement of a range of food selection behaviors and attitudes. In Study Two, participants who identified as either picky or non-picky responded to questionnaire measures of obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, disordered eating symptoms, disgust sensitivity, and food and general neophobia. Participants also rated the intensity of bitter and sweet solutions at three concentrations on a Labeled Magnitude Scale. Results In Study One, picky eaters were more likely to endorse a variety of anomalous eating behaviors and attitudes toward food, including rejection of foods based on sensory characteristics (taste, color, texture). Picky eaters were less likely to endorse enjoyment of eating, and more likely to report that they were unhealthy eaters. In Study Two, picky eaters had significantly higher OCD symptoms, disgust sensitivity, and food neophobia than non-picky eaters, and were more likely to score within the clinical range of depression symptoms, but did not have higher scores on measures of disordered eating or general neophobia. Picky eaters rated both bitter and sweet tastants as more intense than did non-picky eaters.

Although a challenging task, convincing empirical demonstrations have emerged suggesting that non-consciously perceived 'prime' stimuli can influence motor responses to subsequent targets. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that the influence of masked primes is not restricted to target-elicited responses, but can also bias free-choices between alternative behaviours. The present experiment extends these findings by showing that free-choices could also be biased by novel primes that never appeared as targets and therefore could not trigger acquired stimulus-response (S-R) mappings. This new evidence suggests that free-choice behaviour can be influenced by non-consciously triggered semantic representations. Furthermore, the results reported here support accounts of masked priming that posit an automatic semantic categorisation of non-consciously perceived visual stimuli. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Free will; Semantic priming; Unconscious","Bodner, G.E., Mulji, R., Prime proportion affects masked priming of fixed and free-choice responses (2010) Experimental Psychology, 57 (5), p. 360; Corbetta, M., Shulman, G.L., Control of goal-directed and stimulus-driven attention in the brain (2002) Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 3 (3), pp. 201-215; Damian, M.F., Congruity effects evoked by subliminally presented primes: Automaticity rather than semantic processing (2001) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 27 (1), p. 154; Dehaene, S., Changeux, J.-P., Experimental and theoretical approaches to conscious processing (2011) Neuron, 70 (2), pp. 200-227; Dehaene, S., Naccache, L., Le Clec'H, G., Koechlin, E., Mueller, M., Dehaene-Lambertz, G., Imaging unconscious semantic priming (1998) Nature, 395 (6702), pp. 597-600; Dell'Acqua, R., Grainger, J., Unconscious semantic priming from pictures (1999) Cognition, 73 (1), pp. B1-B15; Galton, F., Visualised numerals (1881) Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, pp. 85-102; Green, D., Swets, J., Signal detection theory and psychophysics (1966) Psychological Bulletin, 75, pp. 424-429; Kiesel, A., Kunde, W., Hoffmann, J., Mechanisms of subliminal response priming (2007) Advances in Cognitive Psychology, 3 (1-2), pp. 307-315; Kiesel, A., Wagener, A., Kunde, W., Hoffmann, J., Fallgatter, A.J., Stöcker, C., Unconscious manipulation of free choice in humans (2006) Consciousness and Cognition, 15 (2), pp. 397-408; Klapp, S.T., Nonconscious control mimics a purposeful strategy: Strength of Stroop-like interference is automatically modulated by proportion of compatible trials (2007) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 33 (6), p. 1366; Klapp, S.T., Haas, B.W., Nonconscious influence of masked stimuli on response selection is limited to concrete stimulus-response associations (2005) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 31 (1), p. 193; Klapp, S.T., Hinkley, L.B., The negative compatibility effect: Unconscious inhibition influences reaction time and response selection (2002) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 131 (2), p. 255; Klotz, W., Neumann, O., Motor activation without conscious discrimination in metacontrast masking (1999) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 25 (4), p. 976; Kunde, W., Kiesel, A., Hoffmann, J., Conscious control over the content of unconscious cognition (2003) Cognition, 88 (2), pp. 223-242; Mattler, U., Palmer, S., Time course of free-choice priming effects explained by a simple accumulator model (2012) Cognition, 123 (3), pp. 347-360; Naccache, L., Dehaene, S., Unconscious semantic priming extends to novel unseen stimuli (2001) Cognition, 80 (3), pp. 215-229; Neumann, O., Direct parameter specification and the concept of perception (1990) Psychological Research, 52 (2-3), pp. 207-215; Neumann, O., Klotz, W., Motor responses to nonreportable, masked stimuli: Where is the limit of direct parameter specification (1994) Attention and Performance XV: Conscious and Nonconscious Information Processing, pp. 123-150; Notebaert, W., Gevers, W., Verguts, T., Fias, W., Shared spatial representations for numbers and space: The reversal of the SNARC and the Simon effects (2006) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 32 (5), p. 1197; Parkinson, J., Haggard, P., Subliminal priming of intentional inhibition (2014) Cognition, 130 (2), pp. 255-265; Reuss, H., Pohl, C., Kiesel, A., Kunde, W., Follow the sign!

Recent work has reported adult rat ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) emitted during intermittent swim stress (ISS) may serve as a predictor of resilience. ISS-induced USVs predicted resilience on several endpoints of behavioral depression and may be considered a forecast of innate resilience. However, a potential problem for these previous findings is the lack of generalizability to other contexts, because both the stress induction and post-stress testing occur in water. The current study tests the generalizability of USVs as a predictor of stress resilience in a non-water-based post-test, the juvenile social exploration test of anxiety. The results provide further support that USVs emitted during ISS predict resilience to depression- and anxiety-like behaviors. Extensions of this work to examine the neurobiology of innate resilience associated with ISS-induced USVs are discussed with comparisons to extant models of learned resilience. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Anxiety; Intermittent swim stress; Juvenile social exploration; Resilience; Stress; Ultrasonic vocalizations","Drugan, R.C., Christianson, J.P., Warner, T.A., Kent, S., Resilience in shock and swim stress models of depression (2013) Front Behav Neurosci, 7, pp. 1-8; Franklin, T.B., Saab, B.J., Mansuy, I.M., Neural mechanisms of stress resilience and vulnerability (2012) Neuron, 75, pp. 747-761; Bonanno, G.A., Loss, trauma, and human resilience: have we underestimated the human capacity to thrive after extremely aversive events?

However, few studies have determined a relationship between fighting ability and men's self-perceived capacity to find, attract and retain a mate. This capacity is a complex compound of several traits that evolutionary psychology has called mate value. In the present study, in a population of late adolescent men from Chile (. M±. SD. =. 16.94. ±.89. years), we explored the relationship between fighting ability, estimated by both HGS and a self-perceived fighting ability questionnaire, and mate value, assessed with a self-perceived mate value components questionnaire. The results show a strong influence of fighting ability on mate value. This influence affects the subscales of ""views from the opposite sex"", ""sociality"" and ""relationship history"". However, we did not find an effect on the subscales of ""wealth"", ""parenting"" or ""fear to failure"". The relationship between mate value and fighting ability indicates that fighting ability is a relevant component in understanding men's reproductive behaviour, including intrasexual competition and intersexual selection. This effect was observed in adolescents, who have less mating experience than adults. © 2015.","Adolescent men; Fighting ability; Hand grip strength; Mate value","Archer, J., Thanzami, V., The relation between physical aggression, size and strength, among a sample of young Indian men (2007) Personality and Individual Differences, 43, pp. 627-633; Archer, J., Thanzami, V., The relation between mate value, entitlement, physical aggression, size and strength among a sample of young Indian men (2009) Evolution and Human Behavior, 30, pp. 315-321; Arnott, G., Elwood, R.W., Assessment of fighting ability in animal contests (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77 (5), pp. 991-1004; Bateman, A.J., Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila (1948) Heredity, 2, pp. 349-368. , Sciences, 32, 268-269; Brase, G.L., Guy, E.C., The demographics of mate value and self-esteem (2004) Personality and Individual Differences, 36, pp. 471-484; Buss, D.M., (1994) The evolution of desire, , Basic Books, New York; Buss, D., Human mate guarding (2002) Neuroendocrinology Letters, 23, pp. 23-29; (2009) Evolution and human behaviour.

The unceasing metamorphosis of the discipline of finance from its humble beginning as applied economics to the more sophisticated depiction as applied physics and applied psychology has revolutionized the way we perceive the market and its complexities. One such complexity is the presence of heterogeneous horizon agents in the market. In this context, we have performed a generous review of different aspects of horizon heterogeneity that has been successfully elucidated through the synergy between wavelet theory and finance. The evolution of wavelet has been succinctly delineated to bestow necessary information to the readers who are new to this field. The migration of wavelet into finance and its subsequent branching into different sub-divisions have been sketched. The pertinent literature on the impact of horizon heterogeneity on risk, asset pricing and inter-dependencies of the financial time series are explored. The significant contributions are collated and classified in accordance to their purpose and approach so that potential researcher and practitioners, interested in this subject, can be benefited. Future research possibilities in the direction of ""agency cost mitigation"" and ""synergy between econophysics and behavioral finance in stock market forecasting"" are also suggested in the paper. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, there is a high risk of relapse and developing a chronic illness. Randomized-controlled trails (RCT), the gold-standard for evaluating treatments, show treatments to be efficacious, yet little is known about their generalizability and long-term durability in ""usual-care"" settings. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of evidence-based pediatric OCD-treatments in regular practice. Participants were 109 children (aged 7-17 years) with a primary diagnosis of OCD, recruited from a specialized OCD-clinic in Sweden. Few exclusion criteria were applied. The youths were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months following the first assessment, using Childre's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and Children's OCD Impact Scale. They were treated with Cognitive Behavior Therapy, augmented with SSRI when indicated. The majority responded well to treatment i.e. were free from OCD or in remission at 12 month evaluation. Moreover, the participants psychosocial functioning significantly improved from baseline to evaluation at 6 and 12 months. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Childhood adolescence; Naturalistic study; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Outcome; Treatment","Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (2012) Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 51 (1), pp. 98-113; Abramowitz, J.S., Whiteside, S.P., Deacon, B.J., The effectiveness of treatment for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder: a meta-analysis (2005) Behavior Therapy, 36 (1), pp. 55-63; Achenbach, T., (1991) Manual for the child behavior checklist/4-18 and 1991 profile, , University of Vermont, Department of Psychiatry, Burlington, VT; (1994) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV), 4. , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC; Busner, J., Targum, S.D., The clinical global impressions scale: applying a research tool in clinical practice (2007) Psychiatry (Edgmont), 4 (7), pp. 28-37; Ehlers, S., Gillberg, C., Wing, L., A screening questionnaire for Asperger syndrome and other high-functioning autism spectrum disorders in school age children (1999) Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 29 (2), pp. 129-141; Fitzmaurice, G.M., Laird, N.M., Ware, J.H., (2011) Applied longitudinal analysis, , Wiley, Hoboken, NJ; Gallant, J., Storch, E.A., Merlo, L.J., Ricketts, E.D., Geffken, G.R., Goodman, W.K., Murphy, T.K., Convergent and discriminant validity of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-Symptom Checklist (2008) Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 22 (8), pp. 1369-1376; Geller, D.A., Biederman, J., Griffin, S., Jones, J., Lefkowitz, T.R., Comorbidity of juvenile obsessive-compulsive disorder with disruptive behavior disorders (1996) Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 35 (12), pp. 1637-1646; Geller, D.A., Biederman, J., Stewart, S.E., Mullin, B., Martin, A., Spencer, T., Faraone, S.V., Which SSRI?

The goal of these problems is to construct one or multiple tests to evaluate the test subject. This paper studies a recent formulation of the problem known as the one-dimensional minimax bin-packing problem with bin size constraints (MINIMAX-BSC). In the MINIMAX-BSC, items are initially divided into groups and multiple tests need to be constructed using a single item from each group, while minimizing differences among the tests. We first show that the problem is NP-Hard, which remained an open question. Second, we propose three different local search neighborhoods derived from the exact resolution of special cases of the problem, and combine them into a variable neighborhood search (VNS) metaheuristic. Finally, we test the proposed algorithm using real-life-based instances. The results show that the algorithm is able to obtain optimal or near-optimal solutions for instances with up to 60 000-item pools. Consequently, the algorithm is a viable option to design large-scale tests, as well as to provide tests for online small-sized situations such as those found in e-learning platforms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Supervisors' behaviour development was proposed as an innovative intervention that can reduce psychosocial risks. The ""Stress Management Competency Indicator Tool"" is one of the most important questionnaires that assess managers' preventive behaviour. However, its psychometric properties have never been evaluated and the length of the questionnaire (66 items) limits its practical applicability. The aim of this study was to contribute to the development of the questionnaire by providing psychometric evidence on a brief version of the tool focusing on the ""Managing and Communicating existing and future Work"" cluster of behaviours, which has been found to be the crucial one in terms of stress prevention.A questionnaire was administered to 178 employees of two Italian public organizations (a municipality and a hospital), measuring the supervisors' ""Managing and Communicating existing and future Work"" competency, and the affective well-being and work team effectiveness. The results showed excellent psychometric properties of the supervisors' behaviour scale and confirmed the expected relationships with criterion outcomes (affective well-being and team effectiveness). Overall, the factorial structure and dimensionality, the construct validity and reliability, and the concurrent validity of the tool were strongly supported by this study. We concluded that the brief version of the scale is a valid and reliable measure that can be easily used in practice and that can contribute to the development of research and practice on this topic. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Affective well-being; Psychometrics properties; Stress management competency indicator tool; Supervisors' behaviour; Team climate; Work related stress","Anderson, N.R., West, M.A., Measuring climate for work group innovation: development and validation of the team climate inventory (1998) J.

Erikson’s Young Man Luther (Erikson 1958) into Chinese (see Chen et al., Pastoral Psychology 61:641–654, 2012) provides compelling evidence that this book is a classic in psychology of religion and related fields. In this article I focus on the professional circumstances that contributed to Erikson’s decision to write a book on Martin Luther; his rationale, based on his particular psychoanalytic orientation, for emphasizing Luther’s resourcefulness in emancipating himself from outworn religious beliefs and practices; and the fact that a new personal appreciation for religious expressions also played an important role in his decision to write the book. I also discuss the fact that I was initially attracted to the book because it drew attention to Luther’s redefinition of work and did so in a way that was personally meaningful to me and in later years I have found the topics and themes of melancholy and inner peace to be personally meaningful to me as well. Based on my own experiences with Young Man Luther, I conclude that books become classics because they invite their potential readers to enter into the text in a way that is personally meaningful to them and that they remain classics because their readers discover new ways over the course of their own lives in which the book is personally meaningful to them. I conclude the article with the proposal that Young Man Luther is a religious biography. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Erik H.

This work suggests that institutions related to anonymous markets, moralizing religions, monogamous marriage and complex kinship systems fundamentally shape human psychology and behavior.

It is therefore necessary to understand the behavioural logic and neural underpinnings of how it is established, maintained, broken, and repaired. There are open evolutionary questions about how trust mechanisms should and do evolve; however, here we focus on more proximate psychological and neural mechanisms that mediate trust. Our perspective singles out three basic features: (1) reaping; (2) regarding; and (3) recursive modelling. Reaping involves mechanisms that respond to punishment or reward. Regarding comprises other-regarding or pro-social mechanisms. Recursive modelling encompasses hierarchical cognitive modelling of others through exchanges. Modern work has begun to reveal how these features are realized as modifications to conventional decision-making systems and how they malfunction in disease and injury. © 2015.",,"Rapoport, A., Chammah, A.M., (1965) Prisoner's Dilemma, , The University of Michigan Press; Trivers, R.L., The evolution of reciprocal altruism (1971) Q Rev Biol, 46, pp. 35-57; Axelrod, R., Hamilton, W.D., The evolution of cooperation (1981) Science, 211, pp. 1390-1396; Smith, J.M., (1982) Evolution and the Theory of Games, , Cambridge University Press; Nowak, M.A., (2006) Evolutionary Dynamics, , Harvard University Press; Press, W.H., Dyson, F.J., Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma contains strategies that dominate any evolutionary opponent (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 109, pp. 10409-10413; Keltner, D., Kogan, A., Piff, P.K., Saturn, S.R., The sociocultural appraisals, values, and emotions (SAVE) framework of prosociality: core processes from gene to meme (2014) Annu Rev Psychol, 65, pp. 425-460; Devaine, M., Hollard, G., Daunizeau, J., Theory of mind: did evolution fool us?

Using a one-shot p-beauty contest, we separate subjects into those who display strategic inference and those who do not.

Unmitigated stress can lead to a variety of negative health and behavioral outcomes. Factors like personality, social support, stress appraisal, and coping play a role in how stress affects individuals. This research conceptualizes the psychologically based stress and coping process in a tourism development context. Measurements of each element in the process are tested for construct validity in the context of cruise tourism development in Jamaica. Construct validity was supported for measures of social support and secondary stress appraisal. A measurement of coping was found to have a different factor structure in a tourism context than theoretically predicted. Valid measurement is critical to future research examining relationships within this psychological process and ultimately understanding how individuals' emotional and psychological quality of life is affected by tourism development. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Caribbean;

While recommendations against the use of group debriefing with adults seem to have been made based on research of individual debriefing, recommendations regarding its use with children have been made based on the adult literature. In this review, we outline the possible mechanisms of harm and benefit of debriefing with a discussion of developmental concerns. The available empirical and nonempirical literature on the use of debriefing with youth is summarized. While research does not currently evidence harm in the use of debriefing with children, there is no strong support for its use either. We present both clinical considerations and research implications as they relate to debriefing as well as what this debate has taught us about the challenges to disseminating and evaluating early crisis interventions in general. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adolescents; Children; Crisis intervention; Debriefing; Intervention; Trauma","Mitchell JT, Everly GS.

They examined how art functioned to increase feelings of comfort and safety, help children express thoughts and feelings, aid children in containing emotions, and support ego strengths. The authors attempted to collect data, but were stymied by a low questionnaire return rate; O’Hara, D.M., Taylor, R., Simpson, K., Critical incident stress debriefing: bereavement support in schools—developing a role for an LEA educational psychology service (1994) Educ Psychol Pract, 10 (1), pp. 27-33. , This article described using debriefing as part of a network of support provided to families following the sudden death of a student. Authors reported efforts to make students more comfortable during the debriefing including meeting in homes, providing food and drink, and encouraging drawing.

Women who perceive their partner to be more (vs. less) attractive are more likely to report orgasm at last copulation. Another benefit of male attractiveness to women is that he may sire offspring that will gain the heritable share of this advantage (i.e., ""sexy sons""). Research has not addressed the ""Sexy Sons"" Hypothesis (e.g., as indicated by women's perception of other women's assessments of their partner's attractiveness) in regards to female copulatory orgasm. We secured self-reports from 439 women in a committed, heterosexual relationship and investigated the relationships between women's orgasm at last copulation and (1) women's assessments of their partner's attractiveness and (2) women's perceptions of other women's assessments of their partner's attractiveness. The results indicate that women mated to more (vs. less) attractive men are more likely to report orgasm at last copulation, and this relationship is mediated by women's perceptions of other women's assessments of their partner's attractiveness. We discuss the mediated relationship, note limitations of the research, and suggest future research directions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Evolutionary psychology; Female copulatory orgasm; Good-genes hypothesis; Male attractiveness; Sexy-Sons Hypothesis","Baker, R., Bellis, M.A., Human sperm competition: Ejaculate manipulation by females and a function for the female orgasm (1993) Animal Behaviour, 46, pp. 887-909; Baker, R., Bellis, M.A., (1995) Human sperm competition: Copulation, masturbation, and infidelity, , Chapman & Hall, London, UK; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182; Bogaert, A.F., Fisher, W.A., Predictors of university men's number of sexual partners (1995) Journal of Sex Research, 32, pp. 119-130; Brody, S., Vaginal orgasm is associated with better psychological function (2007) Sexual and Relationship Therapy, 22, pp. 173-191; Brotto, L.A., Bitzer, J., Laan, E., Leiblum, S., Luria, M., Women's sexual desire and arousal disorders (2010) The Journal of Sexual Medicine, 7 PART 2 (1), pp. 586-614; Cashdan, E., Women's mating strategies (1996) Evolutionary Anthropology, 5, pp. 134-143; Costa, R.M., Brody, S., Women's relationship quality is associated with specifically penile-vaginal intercourse orgasm and frequency (2007) Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, 33, pp. 319-327; Ellsworth, R.M., Bailey, D.H., Human female orgasm as evolved signal: A test of two hypotheses (2013) Archives of Sexual Behavior; Eva, K.W., Wood, T.J., Are all the taken men good?

To demonstrate their enduring influence on a broad range of social phenomena, we describe two fields where research continues to highlight the power of social norms: prejudice and energy use. The prejudices that people report map almost perfectly onto what is socially appropriate, likewise, people adjust their energy use to be more in line with their neighbors. We review new approaches examining the effects of norms stemming from multiple groups, and utilizing normative referents to shift behaviors in social networks.

We used data collected from the fourth sweep of the Millennium Cohort Study when children were aged 7 years. We found that Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and Black Caribbean children had significantly more socioemotional difficulties than White children. These differences were partially explained by the relative socioeconomic disadvantage of their families. After accounting for maternal and family environment factors, the differences for Pakistani children remained unexplained. In contrast, Black African children were the only ethnic minority group to have significantly fewer socioemotional difficulties. We investigated the role of four indicators of socioeconomic position in explaining these differences and found equivalised household income had the strongest influence on socioemotional difficulties, and that socioeconomic position associations with socioemotional difficulties were less apparent among Pakistani and Bangladeshi children. The association between adverse economic conditions and socioemotional difficulties was partially mediated by maternal psychological distress. In conclusion, unexplained ethnic differences in socioemotional difficulties were seen, with a disadvantage among Pakistani children and an advantage among Black African children. Our results point to the need to address economic deprivation among ethnic minority groups to reduce children's socioemotional difficulties. © 2015.","Ethnicity; Millennium cohort study; Socioemotional difficulties","Alati, R., Najman, J.M., Shuttlewood, G.J., Williams, G.M., Bor, W., Changes in mental health status amongst children of migrants to Australia: a longitudinal study (2003) Sociol.

Recently, social influence has also become a topic of interest among neuroscientists. The aim of this review is to highlight current research that has examined neural systems associated with social influence, from the perspective of being influenced as well as influencing others, and highlight studies that link neural mechanisms with real-world behavior change beyond the laboratory. Although many of the studies reviewed focus on localizing brain regions implicated in influence within the lab, we argue that approaches that account for networks of brain regions and that integrate neural data with data beyond the laboratory are likely to be most fruitful in understanding influence. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Cialdini, R.B., Goldstein, N.J., Social influence: compliance and conformity (2004) Annu Rev Psychol, 55, pp. 591-621; Cascio, C.N., Dal Cin, S., Falk, E.B., Health communications: predicting behavior change from the brain (2013) Social Neuroscience and Public Health, pp. 57-71. , Springer, New York, P.A.

Aim of the present four-wave study was to examine the cross-lagged relationships between CSE and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following PTEs in order to examine direction of influence. Levels of CSE and PTSD symptoms were measured with 4-month intervals. In addition, prospectively assessed personality traits and general self-efficacy perceptions as well as peritraumatic distress were entered in the analyses. The study sample consists of adult respondents of a representative internet panel who experienced PTE in the six months before T1, and did not experience any new PTE or life event between T1 and T3 (N=400). Respondents were administered the coping self-efficacy scale (CSE-7), impact of event scale (IES) and arousal items of IES-R at each wave (T1 through T3), as well as questions on peritraumatic stress and prospectively measured personality traits (T0). Results of structural equation modeling showed that the effect of CSE on subsequent PTSD symptom levels was dominant. CSE significantly predicted subsequent symptoms, over and above earlier symptom levels, with higher CSE associated with lower PTSD. Symptoms in turn, did not predict subsequent levels of CSE. Higher peritraumatic distress was associated with both higher initial PTSD symptoms and lower initial CSE levels. Higher levels of the personality traits of emotional stability and agreeableness were associated with higher initial CSE levels. This supports a model in which CSE perceptions play an important role in recovery from trauma. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Coping self-efficacy; Cross-lagged analysis; Personality; Potentially traumatic events; Prospective; PTSD","(2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , text rev; Arbuckle, J., (1997) Amos Users' Guide Version 3.6, , SPSS, Chicago; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: toward a unifying theory of behavioral change (1977) Pscychol.

This research extends the work to more complex cognitive phenomena. Forager bees were trained individually to visit a laboratory window for sucrose. On each training trial for all experiments, bees found three stimuli, two identical and one different. In Experiments 1 and 2, stimuli were three-dimensional two-color patterns, and in Experiments 3 and 4, stimuli were two-color patterns displayed on a computer monitor. Training was trial-unique, that is, a different triad of stimuli was presented on each trial. In Experiments 1 and 3, choice of odd was rewarded and choice of nonodd was punished. In Experiments 2 and 4, choice of nonodd was rewarded and choice of odd was punished. On every trial, the initial choice was recorded and correction permitted. Honeybees learned to choose the odd stimulus in Experiments 1 and 3 and the nonodd stimuli in Experiments 2 and 4. The results provide compelling evidence of oddity and nonoddity learning, often interpreted as relational learning in vertebrates. Whether the mechanism of such learning in honeybees is similar to that of vertebrate species remains to be determined. © 2015.","Comparative cognition; Concept learning; Honeybee; Oddity discrimination; Relational learning","Aust, U., Steurer, M.M., Learning of an oddity rule by pigeons in a four-choice touch screen procedure (2013) Anim.

Global efforts have helped to link women to surgical repair, but thus far no evidence-based interventions exist to address the psychological needs of these women during the hospital stay. In this paper, we describe the development of a psychological intervention for women in Tanzania who are receiving surgical care for an obstetric fistula. The intervention was developed based on theories of cognitive behavioral therapy and coping models. Content and delivery were informed by qualitative data collection with a range of stakeholders including women with fistula, and input from a study advisory board. The resulting intervention was six individual sessions, delivered by a trained community health nurse. The session topics were (1) recounting the fistula story; (2) creating a new story about the fistula; (3) loss, grief and shame; (4) specific strategies for coping; (5) social relationships; and (6) planning for the future. A trial run of the intervention revealed that the intervention could be delivered with fidelity and was acceptable to patients. A future randomized control trial will evaluate the efficacy of this intervention to address the mental health symptoms of this population. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cognitive behavioral therapy; Maternal health; Mental health; Obstetric fistula; Tanzania","Ahmed, S., Holtz, S.A., Social and economic consequences of obstetric fistula: Life changed forever?

If people in temporary employment have poorer mental health than those in permanent employment then it is consistent with two mutually inclusive possibilities: temporary employment generates adverse mental health effects and/or individuals with poorer mental health select into temporary from permanent employment. We apply regression analyses to longitudinal data corresponding to about 50,000 observations across 8000 individuals between 1991 and 2008 drawn from the British Household Panel Survey. We find that permanent employees who will be in temporary employment in the future have poorer mental health than those who never become temporarily employed. We also reveal that this relationship is mediated by greater job dissatisfaction. Overall, these results suggest that permanent workers with poor mental health appear to select into temporary employment thus signalling that prior cross section studies may overestimate the influence of employment type on mental health. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Anxiety; Employment transitions; Great Britain; Job satisfaction; Life satisfaction; Psychological distress","Anthony, W.A., Rogers, E.S., Cohen, M., Davies, R.R., Relationship between psychiatric symptomatology, work skills, and future vocational performance (1995) Psychiatr.

All the fish learned to find food quickly, but did so in different ways. Fifty five percent learned to use the light cue to locate food; the remainder achieved the same result by developing a fixed movement routine. To explore this variation, we related learning strategy to stress coping style. Time to find food fell identically with successive trials in carp classified as reactive or proactive, but reactive fish tended to follow the light cue and proactive fish to adopt a fixed routine. Among fish that learned to follow the light, reactive individuals took fewer trials to reach the learning criterion than did proactive fish. These results add to the growing body of information on within-species variation in learning strategies and suggest a possible influence of stress coping style on the use of associative learning as opposed to algorithmic searching during foraging. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Association learning; Common carp; Cyprinus carpio; Personality; Routine formation; Stress coping style","Biro, P.A., Stamps, J.A., Are animal personality traits linked to life-history productivity?

We aimed to test whether low psychological stress resilience assessed in adolescence is associated with an increased risk of receiving medication for depression and anxiety in middle age. We utilized Swedish register-based cohort study. Men born between 1952 and 1956 (n=175,699), who underwent compulsory assessment for military conscription in late adolescence were followed to examine subsequent risk of pharmaceutically-treated depression and anxiety in middle age, from 2006 to 2009 corresponding to ages between 50 and 58 years, using Cox regression. The associations of stress resilience with prescription of antidepressant and anxiolytics medication through potential mediating factors cognitive and physical function and adult socioeconomic factors were calculated. Low stress resilience was associated with elevated risks for antidepressant (hazard ratio (HR):1.5 (95% CI 1.4 1.6)) and anxiolytics (HR:2.4 (CI 2.0 2.7)) medication. Adjustment for measures of childhood living circumstances attenuated the associations somewhat. Around a third of association with low stress resilience, and a half of that with moderate resilience, was mediated through cognitive and physical function in adolescence and adult socioeconomic factors. The magnitude of the inverse association of higher cognitive function with antidepressant medication was eliminated among those with low stress resilience. These results indicate that low stress resilience in adolescence is associated with an increased risk for antidepressant and anxiolytics medication over 30 years later, in part mediated through developmental factors in adolescence and socioeconomic circumstances in adulthood, and low stress resilience can diminish or eliminate the inverse association of higher cognitive function with antidepressant medication. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Antidepressant; Anxiolytics; Medication; Register-based cohort study; Stress resilience; Sweden","Ahern, N.R., Kiehl, E.M., Sole, M.L., Areview of instruments measuring resilience (2006) Issues Compr.

We randomly assigned sixty participants to a 50-min walk in either a natural or an urban environment in and around Stanford, California. Before and after their walk, participants completed a series of psychological assessments of affective and cognitive functioning. Compared to the urban walk, the nature walk resulted in affective benefits (decreased anxiety, rumination, and negative affect, and preservation of positive affect) as well as cognitive benefits (increased working memory performance). This study extends previous research by demonstrating additional benefits of nature experience on affect and cognition through assessments of anxiety, rumination, and a complex measure of working memory (operation span task).

The survey method has been widely used to gain such understanding. However, few previous studies on the tourism and hospitality business have proposed intelligent solutions to analyze such survey data to understand customer preferences on different criteria for different segments, and to determine how customers obtain overall satisfaction across different criteria. In this study, we follow a design-science research paradigm to develop a genetic algorithm-based learning approach to understand customer satisfaction and their psychometric reasons. We further validate this approach through an empirical study for evaluating OTA websites. The results show that different customer segments have different opinions on the importance of various evaluation criteria. The results also reveal that customers tend to judge OTA websites in terms of certain important criteria, instead of by the weighted average of every factor concerned. The proposed approach and the findings of this study can provide constructive suggestions to practitioners and researchers for developing customized marketing campaigns and improving the services of OTA websites. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Customer satisfaction; Genetic algorithm; Online travel agency; Smart tourism; Website evaluation","Anderson, E.W., Fornell, C., Lehmann, D.R., Customer satisfaction, market share, and profitability: findings from Sweden (1994) Journal of Marketing, 58 (3), pp. 53-66; Anselmsson, J., Sources of customer satisfaction with shopping malls: a comparative study of different customer segments (2006) The International Review of Retail, Distribution and Consumer Research, 16 (1), pp. 115-138; Bai, B., Law, R., Wen, I., The impact of website quality on customer satisfaction and purchase intentions: evidence from Chinese online visitors (2008) International Journal of Hospitality Management, 27 (3), pp. 391-402; Baker, D.A., Crompton, J.L., Quality, satisfaction and behavioral intentions (2000) Annals of Tourism Research, 27 (3), pp. 785-804; Bowen, D., Clarke, J., Reflections on tourist satisfaction research: past, present and future (2002) Journal of Vacation Marketing, 8 (4), pp. 297-308; Brislin, R.W., The wording and translation of research instruments (1986) Field methods in cross-cultural research, pp. 137-164. , Sage, Beverly Hills, CA, W.J.

We present an analysis of a case study conducted in a Barcelona metropolitan river corridor, aimed at exploring how the development of people-place bonds can foster pro-environmental behaviours in a natural open space.The multi-method qualitative analysis based on participant observation, documentary research and interviews with 57 inhabitants reveals a long-term process of appropriation of the riverside environment that typically results in a sense of responsibility of the subject towards it. The article specifically shows that the time factor is crucial in the explanation of the process of appropriation, and that future longitudinal studies in this and other cases will be required to assess more accurately its importance. Finally, we stress the benefits of taking proper advantage of citizens' cumulative awareness of the management of river corridors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Appropriation of space; Barcelona river corridor; Environmental restoration; Multi-method; Temporal dimension","Alexander, C., Ishikawa, S., Silverstein, M., (1977) Apattern language: Towns, buildings, construction, , Oxford University Press, New York; Altman, I., Low, S.M., (1992) Place attachment, , Plenum Press, New York; Barker, R.G., Wright, H.F., (1951) One boy's day.

Based on the social stereotype of ""what is beautiful is good"", the present study aimed at investigating whether people coordinate differently with physically attractive people compared to less attractive people. 34 participants were engaged in an interpersonal coordination task with different looking (virtual) agents while performing at the same time a reaction time task. Results showed that participants had more stable motor coordination with the moving attractive than with the less attractive agent, and that the difference in motor coordination could not be interpreted by a specific attention allocation strategy. Our findings provide the evidence that physical attractiveness genuinely affects how people interact with another person, and that the temporal-spatial coordinated movement varies with the partner's psychosocial characteristics.

Although several lines of evidence point to a positive association between PRD and the urge to gamble, the factors that might moderate this relation have yet to be investigated. Through a quantitative research synthesis, we sought to test (a) the overall relation between PRD and gambling urges among people reporting recent gambling experience, and (b) whether this relation is moderated by problem gambling severity. Meta-analysis revealed that, overall, higher self-reported PRD was associated with stronger urges to gamble (r= .26). A meta-regression revealed that, across studies, the strength of this relation depended on problem gambling severity, such that the relation between PRD and gambling urges was stronger among samples higher in average problem gambling severity. This pattern was corroborated by an analysis of the aggregated individual participant data (N= 857), such that PRD predicted gambling urges only among participants higher in problem gambling severity. The potential practical implications and limitations of these results are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Gambling; Gambling urges; Meta-analysis; Meta-regression; Personal relative deprivation; Problem gambling","Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, , Sage, Newbury Park, CA; Buhrmester, M., Kwang, T., Gosling, S.D., Amazon's Mechanical Turk a new source of inexpensive, yet high-quality, data?

A variety of research questions in perception - particularly those dealing with notions such as ""independence,"" ""invariance,"" ""holism,"" and ""configurality"" - can be characterized as special cases of the problem of perceptual separability. Furthermore, many cognitive mechanisms are applied differently to perceptually separable dimensions than to non-separable dimensions. Despite the importance of dimensional separability, surprisingly little is known about its origins. Previous research suggests that categorization training can lead to learning of novel dimensions, but it is not known whether the separability of such dimensions also increases with training. Here, we report evidence that training in a categorization task increases perceptual separability of the category-relevant dimension according to a variety of tests from general recognition theory (GRT). In Experiment 1, participants who received pre-training in a categorization task showed reduced Garner interference effects and reduced violations of marginal invariance, compared to participants who did not receive such pre-training. Both of these tests are theoretically related to violations of perceptual separability. In Experiment 2, participants who received pre-training in a categorization task showed reduced violations of perceptual separability according to a model-based analysis of data using GRT. These results are at odds with the common assumption that separability and independence are fixed, hardwired characteristics of features and dimensions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Category learning; General recognition theory; Perceptual independence; Perceptual separability","Andrews, T.J., Ewbank, M.P., Distinct representations for facial identity and changeable aspects of faces in the human temporal lobe (2004) Neuroimage, 23 (3), pp. 905-913; Arguin, M., Saumier, D., Conjunction and linear non-separability effects in visual shape encoding (2000) Vision Research, 40 (22), pp. 3099-3115; Arguin, M., Saumier, D., Independent processing of parts and of their spatial organization in complex visual objects (2004) Psychological Science, 15 (9), pp. 629-633; Ashby, F.G., Estimating the parameters of multidimensional signal detection theory from simultaneous ratings on separate stimulus components (1988) Perception & Psychophysics, 44 (3), pp. 195-204; Ashby, F.G., Lee, W.W., Predicting similarity and categorization from identification (1991) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 120 (2), pp. 150-172; Ashby, F.G., Maddox, W.T., A response time theory of separability and integrality in speeded classification (1994) Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 38 (4), pp. 423-466; Ashby, F.G., Maddox, W.T., Human category learning (2005) Annual Review of Psychology, 56, pp. 149-178; Ashby, F.G., Queller, S., Berretty, P.M., On the dominance of unidimensional rules in unsupervised categorization (1999) Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics, 61 (6), pp. 1178-1199; Ashby, F.G., Soto, F.A., Multidimensional signal detection theory (2015) Oxford handbook of computational and mathematical psychology, pp. 13-34. , Oxford University Press, New York, NY, J.R.

Applications of moral psychology suggest that climate change may not register as an issue of moral concern for those who identify as right wing due to their tendency to prioritise morality in the forms of the maintenance of tradition and order. Other researchers argue that the right wing tendency to be sceptical of climate change is derived from support for the free market, which may be related to the novel moral domain, 'liberty'. In a survey of the Australian public (n=301) climate change scepticism, and moral beliefs were measured. Regression analysis showed that climate change scepticism is not only predicted by morality aimed at maintenance of the social order, but also independently by morality concerned with the right to liberty.

Drawing upon the psychology and communication literature, which documents that the end of popular TV series causes negative emotional reactions in large numbers of television viewers, I employ major TV series finales (between 1967 and 2012) as mood-altering events. I find that an increase in the fraction of Americans watching a TV show finale on a given day is immediately followed by a decrease in U.S. stock returns. This effect is stronger in small-cap and high-volatility stocks, whose pricing is more sensitive to sentiment, and is consistent with the hypothesis that negative mood reduces the demand for risky assets. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Investment decisions; Negative mood; TV series finales; U.S. stock returns","Amihud, Y., Mendelson, H., Asset pricing and the bid-ask spread (1986) Journal of Financial Economics, 17, pp. 223-249; Andrade, E.B., Behavioral consequences of affect: Combining evaluative and regulatory mechanisms (2005) Journal of Consumer Research, 32, pp. 355-362; Ariel, R., High stock returns before holidays: Existence and evidence on possible causes (1990) Journal of Finance, 45 (5), pp. 1611-1626; Atalay, A.S., Meloy, M.G., Retail therapy: A strategic effort to improve mood (2011) Psychology & Marketing, 28 (6), pp. 638-660; Au, K., Chan, F., Wang, D., Vertinsky, I., Mood in foreign exchange trading: Cognitive processes and performance (2003) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 91, pp. 322-338; Baker, M., Wurgler, J., Investor sentiment and the cross-section of stock returns (2006) Journal of Finance, 61, pp. 1645-1680; Baker, M., Wurgler, J., Investor sentiment in the stock market (2007) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 21, pp. 129-151; Barkhuus, L., Brown, B., Unpacking the television: User practices around a changing technology (2009) ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, 16 (3), p. 22; Bless, H., Bohner, G., Schwarz, N., Strack, F., Mood and persuasion: A cognitive response analysis (1990) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 16 (2), pp. 331-345; Bower, G.H., Mood and memory (1981) American Psychologist, 36, pp. 129-148; Bruyneel, S., Dewitte, S., Franses, P.H., Dekimpe, M.G., I felt low and my purse feels light: Depleting mood regulation attempts affect risk decision making (2009) Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, 22, pp. 153-170; Cao, M., Wei, J., Stock market returns: A note on temperature anomaly (2005) Journal of Banking and Finance, 29, pp. 1559-1573; Chang, S.C., Chen, S.S., Chou, R.K., Lin, Y.H., Local sports sentiment and returns of locally headquartered stocks: A firm-level analysis (2012) Journal of Empirical Finance, 19 (3), pp. 309-318; Chang, E.C., Pinegar, J.M., Seasonal fluctuations in industrial production and stock market seasonals (1989) Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 24 (1), pp. 59-74; Chou, K., Lee, M.C., Ho, H.Y., Does mood state change risk taking tendency in older adults?

Although identity processes of identification with commitment (negatively) and ruminative exploration (positively) were related to NSSI variables, these relationships were no longer significant when controlling for anxiety and depression. When examining identity statuses (using cluster analysis), individuals who had engaged in NSSI in the past (but not currently) were more likely to be in the moratorium cluster and less likely to be in the achievement cluster. Individuals who were currently engaging in NSSI were more likely to be in the troubled diffusion cluster. Clinicians should be attentive to the complex interplay between identity and NSSI when treating adolescents. © 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.","Commitment; Exploration; Identity; Non-suicidal self-injury","Archer, S.L., Waterman, A.S., Varieties of identity diffusions and foreclosures: an exploration of subcategories of the identity statuses (1990) Journal of Adolescent Research, 5, pp. 96-111; Baetens, I., Claes, L., Willem, L., Muehlenkamp, J.J., Bijttebier, P., The relationship between non-suicidal self-injury and temperament in male and female adolescents based on child- and parent-report (2011) Personality and Individual Differences, 50, pp. 527-530; Bjelland, I., Dahl, A.A., Haug, T.T., Neckelmann, D.D., The validity of the hospital anxiety and depression scale - an updated literature review (2002) Journal of Psychosomatic Research, 52, pp. 69-77; Breen, A.V., Lewis, S.P., Sutherland, O., Brief report: non-suicidal self-injury in the context of self and identity development (2013) Journal of Adult Development, 20, pp. 57-62; Claes, L., Luyckx, K., Bijttebier, P., Non-suicidal self-injury in adolescents: prevalence and associations with identity formation above and beyond depression (2014) Personality and Individual Differences, pp. 101-104; Claes, L., Muehlenkamp, J.J., The relationship between the UPPS-P impulsivity dimensions and non-suicidal self-injury characteristics in male and female high school students (2013) Psychiatry Journal, , Article ID 654847; Claes, L., Norré, J., Van Assche, L., Bijttebier, P., Non-suicidal self-injury (functions) in eating disorders: associations with reactive and regulative temperament (2014) Personality and Individual Differences, 57, pp. 65-69; Claes, L., Vandereycken, W., The self-injury questionnaire-treatment related (SIQ-TR): construction, reliability, and validity in a sample of female eating disorder patients (2007) Psychological tests and testing research trends, pp. 111-139. , Nova Science Publishers, New York, P.M.

Studies show that, the SSIC model based on supernetwork has effective intervention effects on rumor spreading. It is worth noting that (i) identifying rumor spreaders in Social Sub-network and isolating them can achieve desired intervention results, (ii) improving environmental information transparency so that the public knows as much information as possible to reduce the rumors is a feasible way to intervene, (iii) persuading wavering neutrals has better intervention effects than clarifying rumors already spread everywhere, so rumors should be intervened in properly in time by psychology counseling. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Modeling and simulation; Opinion supernetwork; Rumor intervention; SSIC model","Cheng, Y.Z., Xu, T., Peng, Q.K., Zhou, W., Opinion dynamics with the different community and individual characteristics (2012) J.

Little is known about prospective changes in psychological and psychosocial functioning following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) amongst patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD). We aimed to assess the functioning of this patient group post liver transplantation. Comprehensive psychosocial assessment of depression (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form X [STAI]) and psychosocial adjustment (Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale-Self-Report version [PAIS-SR]) was conducted with 42 ALD patients available for pre and post OLT testing. Dependence severity was assessed by the Brief Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (bMAST). Significant reductions in average anxiety and depression symptoms were observed 12-months post-OLT. Significant improvements in psychosocial adjustment to illness were also reported. Patients with higher levels of alcohol dependence severity pre transplant assessment improved comparably to those with lower levels of dependence. In summary, the study found that OLT contributed to reducing overall levels of mood and anxiety symptoms in ALD patients, approximating general (non-clinical) population norms. Psychosocial adjustment also improved significantly post liver transplantation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Alcoholic liver disease; Liver transplantation; Psychosocial functioning","Anantharaju, A., Van Thiel, D., Liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease (2003) Alcohol Research & Health, 27, pp. 257-268;

Although many methods and devices have been developed creatively and shown their efficiency in experiments, few of them are suitable for commercial applications routinely. Here, we design a wearable falling detector as a mobile terminal, and utilize the wireless technology to transfer and monitor the activity data of the host in a relatively small community. With the help of the accelerometer sensor and the Google Mapping service, information of the location and the activity data will be send to the remote server for the downstream processing. The experimental result has shown that SA (Sum-vector of all axes) value of 2.5 g is the threshold value to distinguish the falling from other activities. A three-stage detection algorithm was adopted to increase the accuracy of the real alarm, and the accuracy rate of our system was more than 95%. With the further improvement, the falling detecting device which is low-cost, accurate and user-friendly would become more and more common in everyday life.

We aim to provide a comprehensive examination of substance use among pregnant adolescents in the United States. Method: Employing data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health between 2002 and 2012 (. n=. 97,850), we examine the prevalence of the past 12-month and the past 30-day substance use and substance use disorders among pregnant and non-pregnant adolescents (ages 12-17). We also examine psychosocial and pregnancy-related correlates of current substance use among the subsample of pregnant adolescents (. n=. 810). Results: Pregnant teens were significantly more likely to have experimented with a variety of substances and meet criteria for alcohol (AOR. =. 1.65, 95% CI. =. 1.26-2.17), cannabis (AOR. =. 2.29, 95% CI. =. 1.72-3.04), and other illicit drug use disorders (AOR. =. 2.84, 95% CI. =. 1.92-4.19). Pregnant early adolescents (ages 12-14; AOR. =. 4.34, 95% CI. =. 2.28-8.26) were significantly more likely and pregnant late adolescents (ages 15-17; AOR. =. 0.71, 95% CI. =. 0.56-0.90) significantly less likely than their non-pregnant counterparts to be current substance users. Conclusions: Study findings point not only to a relationship between pregnancy and prior substance use, but also suggest that substance use continues for many teens during pregnancy. We found that substance use is particularly problematic among early adolescents and that the prevalence of substance use attenuates dramatically as youth progress from the first to the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Early adolescence; Sexual risk behavior; Substance use; Teen pregnancy","Amaro, H., Zuckerman, B., Cabral, H., Drug use among adolescent mothers: Profile of risk (1989) Pediatrics, 84 (1), pp. 144-151; (2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV-TR Fourth Edition (text revision), , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, D.C; Barnet, B., Duggan, A.K., Wilson, M.D., Joffe, A., Association between postpartum substance use and depressive symptoms, stress, and social support in adolescent mothers (1995) Pediatrics, 96 (4), pp. 659-666; Bessa, M.A., Mitsuhiro, S.S., Chalem, E., Barros, M.M., Guinsburg, R., Laranjeira, R., Underreporting of use of cocaine and marijuana during the third trimester of gestation among pregnant adolescents (2010) Addictive Behaviors, 35 (3), pp. 266-269; Bellis, M., Hughes, K., Calafat, A., Juan, M., Ramon, A., Rodriguez, J., Phillips-Howard, P., Sexual uses of alcohol and drugs and the associated health risks: a cross sectional study of young people in nine European cities (2008) BMC Public Health, 8 (1), p. 155; Boden, J.M., Fergusson, D.M., John Horwood, L., Early motherhood and subsequent life outcomes (2008) Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 49 (2), pp. 151-160; Brandon, A.R., Psychosocial interventions for substance use during pregnancy (2014) The Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing, 28 (3), pp. 169-177; Chapman, S.L.C., Wu, L.T., Substance use among adolescent mothers: A review (2013) Children and youth services review, 35 (5), pp. 806-815; Cleveland, M.J., Feinberg, M.E., Osgood, D.W., Moody, J., Do peers' parents matter?

Data on psychopathology, global and social functioning, patient satisfaction, continuity of care and administrative data was gathered on admission, throughout the course of treatment, upon discharge and at 1-year follow-up. In addition, the physicians in charge rated the therapeutic relationship. The data analysis consists of group-wise comparisons and regression analyses (cross-tabulations and χ2 test statistics for categorical data and Mann–Whitney U tests for continuous data). Differences between groups over time were analyzed with a series of generalized linear mixed model. The integrated care group showed a significant reduction in psychopathological impairment (20.7 %) and an improvement of psychosocial functioning (36.8 %). The mean number of days before re-admission was higher in the control group when compared to the integrated care group (156.8 vs. 91.5). There was no difference in the number of re-admissions and days spent in psychiatric institutions. This new approach offers a treatment model, which facilitates continuity of care. Beside it improves psychopathological outcome measures and psychosocial functioning in patients with mental illness. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Acute day hospital; Continuity of psychiatric care; In-patient care; Integrated care; Outpatient care","Uijen, A.A., Schers, H.J., Schellevis, F.G., van den Bosch, W.J., How unique is continuity of care?

The field of entrepreneurship has evolved in a rather disjointed or seemingly random manner, and entrepreneurship has developed as a business discipline by borrowing, building upon, and adapting theoretical and conceptual work from such fields as sociology, psychology, anthropology, marketing, management, finance, organizational behavior, and engineering. And yet, it would appear that the volume of work attempting to describe, explain, and predict aspects of entrepreneurship has grown to a point where we can begin to develop a more complete and integrated picture. The purpose of this paper was to examine the various theoretical perspectives and frameworks of entrepreneurship and to offer an integrative perspective through a proposed “framework of frameworks” which ties together other existing frameworks, each of which explores a particular aspect of the overall phenomenon of entrepreneurship. The value of using a framework to explain and therefore better understand entrepreneurship is examined. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Entrepreneurship theory; Entrepreneurship typologies; Integrated framework; Process frameworks","Adizes, I., (1988) Corporate lifecycles: How and why corporations grow and die, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ:; Alvarez, S.A., Barney, J.B., Discovery and creation: Alternative theories of entrepreneurial action (2007) Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 1, pp. 11-16; Alvord, S.H., Brown, D.L., Letts, C.W., Social entrepreneurship and societal transformation: An exploratory study (2004) Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, 40 (3), pp. 260-282; Amit, R., Glosten, L., Muller, E., Challenges to theory development in entrepreneurial research (1993) Journal of Management Studies, 30 (5), pp. 275-294; Aronsson, M., Education matters—but does entrepreneurship education?

To answer this question, we attempted to replicate two supported models using data from union men (N = 150): The interactional effect model of union women’s mental health and the conditional indirect effect model of women’s union participation (Mellor and Golay in Employee Responsibilities and Rights Journal, 2014a, Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied, 148, 73–91, 2014b).

By the knowledge structure (a conceptual model) we define the main domain concepts and relations between them in the form of a graph, map or diagram. This approach considers individual cognitive styles and uses recent advances in knowledge engineering and conceptual structuring; it aims to create new, consistent and structurally holistic knowledge bases for various areas of science and technology. Two stages of research have been completed: research into correlations between the expert's individual cognitive style and the peculiarities of the expert's subject domain ontology development; and research into correlations between the expert's individual cognitive style and the group ontology design (including design accomplished by groups of experts with either similar or different cognitive styles). The results of these research stages can be applied to organizing collaborative ontology design (especially for research and learning purposes), data structuring and other group analytical work. Implications for practice are briefly delineated. © 2015 The Authors.","Cognitive ergonomics; Cognitive style; Collaborative design; Conceptual structuring; Knowledge engineering; Ontologies","Adeli, H., (2003) Expert Systems in Construction and Structural Engineering, , CRC Press; Baader, F., Horrocks, I., Sattler, U., Description logics as ontology languages for the semantic web (2005) Mechanizing Mathematical Reasoning, LNAI 2605, pp. 228-248. , D.

In particular, the ACA has established the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), which has been tasked with developing national priorities and funding research aimed at improving health care quality by helping patients and providers make informed health care decisions. PCORI's national priorities span 5 broad domains: person-centered outcomes research, health disparities research, health care systems research, communication and dissemination research, and methodologic research. As these national priorities overlap with the knowledge and skills often emphasized in psychology training programs, initiatives by training programs to bolster strengths in these domains could place trainees at the forefront of this emerging research paradigm. As a part of a new master's program in behavioral health, our program developed a health psychology course modeled around PCORI's 5 national priorities; an initial evaluation in a small sample supported student learning in the 5 PCORI domains. The current report has implications for familiarizing readers with PCORI's national priorities for U.S. health care, stimulating debate surrounding psychology's response to the largest health care paradigm shift in recent U.S. history, and providing a working model for programs seeking to implement PCORI-related changes to their curricula.

The processes targeted in PPT (e.g., strengths, forgiveness, gratitude, savoring) are not emphasized in traditional psychotherapy approaches to psychosis. The goal in modifying PPT is to develop a new clinical approach to helping people experiencing psychosis. An evidence-based theoretical framework was therefore used to modify 14-session standard PPT into a manualized intervention, called WELLFOCUS PPT, which aims to improve well-being for people with psychosis. Informed by a systematic review and qualitative research, modification was undertaken in 4 stages: qualitative study, expert consultation, manualization, and stake-holder review.

Objective: The present study was designed to provide a comparison of rates of self-reported sexual aggression perpetration obtained using 2 different measures-a version of the Sexual Experiences Survey (SES; Abbey, Parkhill, Clinton-Sherrod, & Zawacki, 2007; Koss, Gidycz, & Wisniewski, 1987) and the Sexual Strategies Scale (SSS, Strang, Peterson, Hill, & Heiman, 2013; Struckman-Johnson, Struckman-Johnson, & Anderson, 2003). We also examined the psychometric structure of each measure using Rasch model item analysis (Rasch, 1966). Method: Two equivalent cohorts of entering freshman males (n = 994 and n = 1043) from a large northeastern university completed online measures at the end of their first semester. Results: Identical proportions of men reported using intoxication strategies (3%) and physical force (1%) during the past semester on both measures. More men reported verbal strategies on the SSS (7.8%) compared with the SES (3.7%), even when restricting to equivalent items. Rasch analysis suggested that the SSS conformed better to a unidimensional continuum of perpetration severity than the SES; however, Rasch analysis did not provide definitive support for either a tactic-based (SSS) or a tactic-plus-outcome-based (SES) hierarchy. Conclusions: Both measures functioned adequately. However, the SSS may be preferred for its better Rasch properties, better assessment of the less severe tactics, and simpler wording.

In a new take on this issue, we show that prime nonwords facilitate lexical decisions to target words ending with the same suffix (sheeter–TEACHER) compared to a condition where the critical suffix was substituted by another one (sheetal–TEACHER) or by an unrelated nonmorphological ending (sheetub– TEACHER). We also show that this effect is genuinely morphological, as no priming emerged in noncomplex items with the same orthographic characteristics (sportel–BROTHEL vs. sportic–BROTHEL vs. sportur–BROTHEL). In a further experiment, we took advantage of these results to assess whether suffixes are recognized in a position-specific fashion. Masked suffix priming did not emerge when the relative order of stems and suffixes was reversed in the prime nonwords—ersheet did not yield any time saving in the identification of teacher as compared to either alsheet or obsheet. We take these results to show that –er was not identified as a morpheme in ersheet, thus indicating that suffix identification is position specific. This conclusion is in line with data on interference effects in nonword rejection and strongly constrains theoretical proposals on how complex words are identified. In particular, because these findings were reported in a masked priming paradigm, they suggest that positional constraints operate early, most likely at a prelexical level of morpho-orthographic analysis. © 2015 The Experimental Psychology Society","Masked suffix priming; Position coding; Suffix identification; Visual word identification",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929009194

We examined whether pathological anxiety might also increase distractibility for emotionally neutral irrelevant sounds presented prior to target stimuli in a task where these stimuli do not compete for selection. Patients with anxiety and control participants categorized visual digits preceded by task-irrelevant sounds that changed on rare trials (auditory deviance). Both groups exhibited an equivalent increase in response times following a deviant sound but patients showed a reduction of response accuracy, which was entirely due to an increase in response omissions.

All faces could be presented with or without paraphernalia (e.g., hats, glasses, facial hair). Results showed that paraphernalia distracted participants, and that the most distracting condition was when the cue and the distractor face had paraphernalia but the target face did not, while there was no correlation between distractibility and participants’ scores on the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ). Schizotypy was negatively correlated with proportion of time fixating on the eyes and positively correlated with not fixating on a feature.

This allows for computing word similarities as the cosine of the angle between two such vectors. In two experiments, we investigated whether LSA cosine similarities predict priming effects, in that higher cosine similarities are associated with shorter reaction times (RTs). Critically, we applied a pseudo-random procedure in generating the item material to ensure that we directly manipulated LSA cosines as an independent variable. We employed two lexical priming experiments with lexical decision tasks (LDTs). In Experiment 1 we presented participants with 200 different prime words, each paired with one unique target. We found a significant effect of cosine similarities on RTs. The same was true for Experiment 2, where we reversed the prime-target order (primes of Experiment 1 were targets in Experiment 2, and vice versa). The results of these experiments confirm that LSA cosine similarities can predict priming effects, supporting the view that they are psychologically relevant. The present study thereby provides evidence for qualifying LSA cosine similarities not only as a linguistic measure, but also as a cognitive similarity measure. However, it is also shown that other DSMs can outperform LSA as a predictor of priming effects. © 2015 The Experimental Psychology Society","Distributional semantics models; Latent semantic analysis; Semantic priming; Semantic space models",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929012635

Sixteen participants performed an auditory picture verification task on sentences presented with natural versus flat intonation. Stimuli included sentences in which the garden-path interpretation was plausible, implausible because of a late pragmatic cue, or implausible because of a semantic mismatch between an optionally transitive verb and the following noun. Natural sentence intonation was correlated with left-hemisphere temporal activation, but also with activation that suggests the allocation of more resources to interpretation when natural prosody is provided. Garden-path processing was associated with upregulation in bilateral inferior parietal and right-hemisphere dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior frontal cortex, while differences between the strength and type of plausibility cues were also reflected in activation patterns. Region of interest (ROI) analyses in regions associated with complex syntactic processing are consistent with a role for posterior temporal cortex supporting access to verb argument structure. Furthermore, ROI analyses within left-hemisphere inferior frontal gyrus suggest a division of labour, with the anterior–ventral part primarily involved in syntactic–semantic mismatch detection, the central part supporting structural reanalysis, and the posterior–dorsal part showing a general structural complexity effect. © 2015 The Experimental Psychology Society","Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Garden-path sentences; Plausibility; Prosody; Sentence processing",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929000911

Their article introduces a historical and conceptual analysis of SCMs and proposes changing the, often prevailing, tendency of neglecting SCM as an alternative to Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST). This article contributes by putting a new light on SCM as an equally important methodology in psychology. The intention of the present article is to elaborate this point of view further by discussing one of the most fundamental requirements as well as main characteristics of SCM regarding temporality. In this respect that; “…performance is assessed continuously over time and under different conditions…” Hurtado-Parrado and López-López (IPBS: Integrative Psychological & Behavioral Science, 49:2, 2015). Defining principles when it comes to particular units of analysis, both synchronic (spatial) and diachronic (temporal) elements should be incorporated. In this article misunderstandings of the SCM will be adduced, and further the temporality will be described in order to propose how the SCM could have a more severe usability in psychological research. It is further discussed how to implement SCM in psychological methodology. It is suggested that one solution might be to reconsider the notion of time in psychological research to cover more than a variable of control and in this respect also include the notion of time as an irreversible unity within life. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Generalization; Reproduction; Single-case methods; Temporality",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928978688

According to their model, there are two systems of status attainment in humans—“two ways to the top”: the dominance route, which involves physical intimidation, a psychology of fear and hubristic pride, and provides coercive power, and the prestige route, which involves skills and knowledge (competence), a psychology of attraction to experts and authentic pride, and translates mainly into influence. The two systems would have evolved in response to different selective pressures, with attraction to experts serving a social learning function and coinciding with the evolution of cumulative culture. In this paper I argue that (1) the only one way to the top is competence because dominance itself involves competence and confers prestige, so there is no such thing as pure dominance status; (2) dominance in primates has two components: a competitive one involving physical coercion and a cooperative one involving competence-based attraction to high-ranking individuals (proto-prestige); (3) competence grants the same general type of power (dependence-based) in humans and other primates; (4) the attractiveness of high rank in primates is homologous with the admiration of experts in humans; (5) upon the evolution of cumulative culture, the attractiveness of high rank was co-opted to generate status differentials in a vast number of culturally generated domains of activity. I also discuss, in this perspective, the origins of hubristic pride, authentic pride, and nonauthoritarian leadership. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Admiration; Cumulative culture; Dominance; Leadership; Prestige; Pride",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928978756

In situations requiring several responses, we often have to cascade different actions. The strategies used to accomplish this have been subject to extensive research in cognitive psychology and neuroscience but it has remained rather unclear if and to what degree such strategies are adapted while performing a task. Furthermore, we do not know if such adaptations are subject to differential effects depending on an individual's preferred initial strategy to cope with multiple-demand situations. Using Bayesian analyses, we were able to show that even though the applied strategy is subject to slight modulations over the course of an action cascading task, this shift is equally strong for subjects who differ their general action cascading strategy. The action cascading strategy subjects apply to cope with multiple-demand situations is adapted independent of the preferred, inter-individually varying strategy that is initially used. Future research needs to test if the task goal activation strategy applied during action cascading reflects a 'cognitive trait' and is stable across different situations.",,"Miller, J., Ulrich, R., Rolke, B., On the optimality of serial and parallel processing in the psychological refractory period paradigm: Effects of the distribution of stimulus onset asynchronies (2009) Cognit.

The current work draws upon the metacognition and decision making literatures to examine improving metacognition in the classroom. Using historical data from several semesters of an upper-level undergraduate course (N = 127), we analyzed students’ judgments of their performance and their actual performance for two exams. Students were instructed on the concepts of overconfidence, received feedback on exams, and were given incentives for accurate calibration. We found results consistent with the “unskilled and unaware” effect Kruger & Dunning (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77(6), 1121–1134, 1999) where lower performing students initially displayed overconfidence and the highest performing students initially displayed underconfidence. Importantly, students were able to change both judgments and performance such that metacognitive accuracy improved significantly from the first to the second exam. In a second study, two additional semesters for the same course used in Study 1 were examined (N = 90). For one of the semesters feedback was not provided, allowing us to determine whether feedback can improve both metacognitive judgments and performance. Our findings revealed significant improvements in performance paired with decreases in overconfidence on Exam 2, but only for students who received feedback about their performance and judgments. We postulate that feedback may be an important component in improvement metacognitive judgments. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Metacognition; Overconfidence; Performance; Students; Underconfidence",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928978662

Research indicates that ineffective parenting practices are associated with disruptive behavior in offspring and disruptive behavior in offspring affects parenting practices. However, this relationship is not studied in emerging adulthood. Thus, we examined the relationship between parenting and disruptive behavior in a sample of emerging adults. It was hypothesized that rule-breaking behavior would have a stronger impact on parenting than aggressive behavior and ADHD problems, and parental psychopathology would mediate the relationship between disruptive behavior and parenting. Participants were 484 college students age 18–24 years. Current perceptions of mothers and fathers were measured separately via an online survey using the Parental Authority Questionnaire, Parental Environment Questionnaire, Conflict Tactics Scale: Parent–Child Version, and the Adult Self-Report/Adult Behavior Checklist. As hypothesized, ADHD had no association with parenting or discipline practices. Rule-breaking behavior in sons and daughters was associated more highly with maternal effective parenting and harsh discipline than aggressive behavior and ADHD problems. For fathers, rule-breaking behavior in sons was associated more highly with paternal effective parenting than aggressive behavior or ADHD problems. Mediation by parental psychopathology was largely supported for mothers and fathers and moderation by participant gender was found in some cases. Regarding clinical significance, parents of emerging adults with disruptive behavior may experience distress influencing their ability to parent effectively. It may be suggested that parents of emerging adults seek methods to learn to parent more effectively. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Disruptive behavior; Emerging adulthood; Parenting",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928963013

The failure in the reduction in diagnostic errors, notwithstanding the considerable investment in human and economic resources, has paved the way to new strategies which were made available by the development of cognitive psychology, the branch of psychology that aims at understanding the mechanisms of human reasoning. This new approach led us to realize that we are not fully rational agents able to take decisions on the basis of logical and probabilistically appropriate evaluations. In us, two different and mostly independent modes of reasoning coexist: a fast or non-analytical reasoning, which tends to be largely automatic and fast-reactive, and a slow or analytical reasoning, which permits to give rationally founded answers. One of the features of the fast mode of reasoning is the employment of standardized rules, termed “heuristics.” Heuristics lead physicians to correct choices in a large percentage of cases. Unfortunately, cases exist wherein the heuristic triggered fails to fit the target problem, so that the fast mode of reasoning can lead us to unreflectively perform actions exposing us and others to variable degrees of risk.

In this article, we define the construct of empathy and its relevance for counseling psychology. The importance of deficits in empathic processes for most of the psychological disorders is presented within the context of the social brain hypothesis (Frith, 2007). We provide a review of empirical research about the neural correlates of empathy in terms of both the central and peripheral nervous system. We present recent evidence on the cortical and subcortical regions involved in different dimensions of empathy-emotional contagion, cognitive and emotional empathy, and self-regulation. Regarding the autonomic correlates of empathy, we present evidence about the correlates of sympathetic arousal associated with empathic processes and review data supporting the idea of the physiological linkage or synchrony as indicator of empathy in interpersonal relationships. The implications of these findings for counseling psychology, particularly for the psychotherapist-client relationship and for context of intimate relationships or couples therapy, are discussed.

Delivering exercises at a participant's desired difficulty has the potential to improve both motor learning and users' engagement in therapy. Motivation and engagement are among the contributing factors to the success of exercise programs. The authors previously demonstrated that error amplification can be used to introduce levels of challenge into a robotic reaching task, and that machine-learning algorithms can dynamically adjust difficulty to the desired level with 85% accuracy. Building on these findings, we present the results of a proof-of-concept study investigating the impacts of practicing under desirable difficulty conditions. A control condition with a predefined random order for difficulty levels was deemed more suitable for this study (compared to constant or continuously increasing difficulty). By practicing the task at their desirable difficulties, participants in the experimental group perceived their performance at a significantly higher level and reported lower required effort to complete the task, in comparison to a control group. Moreover, based on self-reports, participants in the experimental group were willing, on average, to continue the training session for 4.6 more training blocks (∼45 min) compared to the control group's average. This study demonstrates the efficiency of delivering the exercises at the user's desired difficulty level to improve the user's engagement in exercise tasks. Future work will focus on clinical feasibility of this approach in increasing stroke survivors' engagement in their therapy programs. 2015 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC","challenge point; desirable difficulty; machine learning prediction; motor performance; physiological signals; rehabilitation robotics; user engagement",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929009162

Psychological traits may influence the appraisal, interpretation and coping ability regarding stressful situations. Detailed investigations of psychological traits in relation to stress reactivity in psoriasis are rare. The aim of this study was to examine whether patients with psoriasis who report an association between psychological distress and exacerbation, ""stress reactors"" (SRs), differ psychologically from those with no stress reactivity ""non-stress reactors"" (NSRs). Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 101 consecutively recruited outpatients with plaque psoriasis. A psychosocial interview was performed including questions concerning stress reactivity in relation to onset and exacerbation. Three validated self-rating scales were used: Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, Form-Y), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and Swedish Universities Scales of Personality (SSP). Independent samples t-tests, Chi-square tests and one-way ANOVA analyses were used for group comparisons when appropriate. A logistic regression model was designed with SR as the dependent variable. Results: Sixty-four patients (63%) reported a subjective association between disease exacerbation and stress (SRs). Patients defined as SRs reported significantly higher mean scores regarding state and trait anxiety, depression, and also five SSP scale personality traits, i.e. somatic trait anxiety, psychic trait anxiety, stress susceptibility, lack of assertiveness and mistrust, compared with NSRs. In multivariate analysis, SSP-stress susceptibility was the strongest explanatory variable for SR, i.e. OR (95% CI)=1.13 (1.02 - 1.24), p=0.018. Conclusion: According to our results, patients who perceive stress as a causal factor in their psoriasis might have a more vulnerable psychological constitution. This finding suggests important opportunities for clinicians to identify patients who may benefit from additional psychological exploration and support. 2015 © Remröd et al.","Anxiety; Depression; Personality assessment; Plaque psoriasis; Psychology; Stress","Nestle, F.O., Kaplan, D.H., Barker, J., Psoriasis (2009) N Engl J Med, 361, pp. 496-509; Griffiths, C.E., Barker, J.N., Pathogenesis and clinical features of psoriasis (2007) Lancet, 370, pp. 263-271; Lofvendahl, S., Theander, E., Svensson, A., Carlsson, K.S., Englund, M., Petersson, I.F., Validity of diagnostic codes and prevalence of physician-diagnosed psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in southern Sweden-a population-based register study (2014) PLoS One, 9; Gaston, L., Lassonde, M., Bernier-Buzzanga, J., Hodgins, S., Crombez, J.C., Psoriasis and stress: A prospective study (1987) J Am Acad Dermatol, 17, pp. 82-86; Hunter, H.J., Griffiths, C.E., Kleyn, C.E., Does psychosocial stress play a role in the exacerbation of psoriasis?

The important geometrical parameters of volute are prioritized by applying first level of analytic hierarchy process. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions, based on mathematics and psychology. Based on review of literatures, three levels are defined for each geometrical parameter. Reduction in the percentage variation of static pressure at impeller outlet, minimization of losses inside volute and maximization of stagnation pressure at volute outlet are selected as quality characteristics to ensure the enhancement of centrifugal blower performance. In this process, numerical simulation of 3-D flow in single stage centrifugal blower volute is carried out by FLUENT software for matrix experiments. These matrix experiments are suggested by Minitab software. The simulation case is carried out by flow, turbulence and Energy equations using SIMPLE pressure-velocity coupling. Standard discretisation method is used to solve pressure whereas; others are solved by second order upwind discretisation method. The realizable k-. ε is adapted as turbulence model. Stator-rotor interactions are defined by means of mixing plane model of multiple rotating reference frames. Impeller is situated in rotating reference frame whereas; volute is in fixed reference frame. The process reveals that optimization of the original geometry of blower, at 1.5 times width of impeller, 24° tongue angle and 10% reduction in volute outer radial locations, pressure head and flow uniformity increases compared to other cases; this improvement takes place due to reduction in the non-uniformity of flow at impeller outlet and losses inside the volute passages. The experimental performance of optimized configuration is carried out and compared with existing centrifugal blower. The result indicates better performance in case of optimized volute than original configuration of volute. In case of optimized centrifugal blower, 7.4% higher efficiency is observed at the design rated speed compared to existing centrifugal blower. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Centrifugal blower; CFD; Optimization; Taguchi method; Volute casing","Turton, R.K., (1984) Principles of turbo machinery, , J.W.

Transnational family studies on children who are ""left behind"" indicate that children suffer psychologically from parental migration. Many of the factors identified as affecting children's responses to parental migration however are not considered in child psychology and family sociology studies. This study aims to bridge these areas of knowledge by quantitatively investigating the association between transnational families and children's psychological well-being. It analyzes a survey conducted in three African countries in 2010-11 (Ghana N=2760; Angola N=2243; Nigeria N=2168) amongst pupils of secondary schools. The study compares children in transnational families to those living with their parents in their country of origin. Children's psychological well-being is measured through the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Multiple regression analyses reveal that children in transnational families fare worse than their counterparts living with both parents but not in Ghana where living conditions mediate this relationship. This paper also looks at four characteristics of transnational families and finds that specific characteristics of transnational families and country contexts matter: (1) changing caregivers is associated with poorer well-being in all countries; (2) which parent migrates does not make a difference in Ghana, when mothers migrate and fathers are caregivers results in poorer well-being in Nigeria, and both mother's and father's migration result in worse outcomes in Angola; (3) the kin relationship of the caregiver is not associated with poorer well-being in Ghana and Nigeria but is in Angola; (4) children with parents who migrate internationally do not show different results than children whose parents migrate nationally in Ghana and Nigeria but in Angola international parental migration is associated with poorer psychological well-being. The study shows that broader characteristics in the population rather than parental migration per se are associated with decreased levels of well-being. © 2014 The Authors.","Angola; Child well-being; Ghana; Nigeria; Psychological health; School children; Transnational families","Antman, F.M., Gender, educational attainment and the impact of parental migration on children left behind (2012) J.Popul.

This laboratory study was designed to further investigate how having or not having control over the thermal environment affects human responses to the indoor environment.The study was conducted in summer in a field laboratory that was kept at 28°C. A total of 23 subjects were exposed twice for about 2.5h. During the first session (A) subjects were able to fine-tune their local thermal environment at any given time with a personal desk fan with continuous, stepless adjustable control. During the second session (B) subjects still had the desk fans, but this time the fans were controlled from an adjacent room by the researchers who adjusted the individual air speed profiles so they were identical to those recorded during the first session. Thus, each subject was exposed to two customized conditions with identical exposure, only different from a psychological point of view.During the two sessions identical questionnaires and performance tests were used to evaluate subjects' comfort, SBS symptom incidence and performance. As expected, perceived control over the environment was significantly higher during session A, but there were no differences in perceived comfort and SBS symptom intensity. Both self-assessed and objectively measured performance was significantly better during session B. About two-thirds of the subjects indicated to prefer the situation as during the first session when they themselves controlled the air movement. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive opportunities; Environmental psychology; Fans; Individual control; Productivity; Thermal comfort","Baarda, D.B., De Goede, M.P.M., van Dijkum, C., (2004) Introduction to statistics with SPSS: a guide to the processing, analyzing and reporting of (research) data, , Noordhoff Publishers, Groningen, The Netherlands; Bell, P.A., Greene, Y.C., Fisher, J.D., Baum, A.S., (2006) Environmental psychology, , Harcourt Brace College Publishers, Toronto, Canada; Boerstra, A.C., Beuker, T.C., Impact of perceived personal control over indoor climate on health and comfort in Dutch offices (2011) Proceedings of the 12th international conference on indoor air quality and climate (Indoor air 2011), , University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA; Boerstra, A.C., Loomans, M.G.L.C., Hensen, J.L.M., Modeling personal control over indoor climate (2012) Proceedings healthy buildings, , Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia; Boerstra, A.C., Beuker, T.C., Loomans, M.G.L.C., Hensen, J.L.M., Impact of available and perceived control on comfort and health in European offices (2013) Archit Sci Rev, 56 (1), pp. 30-41; Boerstra, A.C., Loomans, M.G.L.C., Hensen, J.L.M., Personal control over temperature in winter in Dutch office buildings (2013) HVAC&R Res, 19 (8), pp. 1033-1050; de Dear, R.J., Brager, G., Cooper, D., (1997) Developing an adaptive model of thermal comfort and preference, , Final report ASHRAE RP 884, ASHRAE, Atlanta, GA; Fanger, P.O., (1970) Thermal comfort, , Danish Technical Press, Copenhagen, Denmark; Fanger, P.O., Human requirements in future air-conditioned environments (2001) Int J Refrig, 24 (2), pp. 148-153; Field, A., (2005) Discovering statistics using SPSS, , SAGE Publications Ltd, London, UK; Fisk, W., Rosenfeld, A., Estimates of improved productivity and health from better indoor environments (1997) Indoor Air J, 7 (3), pp. 158-172; Fountain, M., Brager, G., de Dear, R., Expectations of indoor climate control (1996) Energy Build, 24 (3), pp. 179-182; Haldi, F., Robinson, D., On the behavior and adaptation of office occupants (2008) Build Environ, 43 (12), pp. 2163-2177; (2011) IBM SPSS statistics for windows, version 20.0, , IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY; (2005) Ergonomics of the thermal environment: analytical determination and interpretation of thermal comfort using calculation of the PMV and PPD indices and local thermal comfort criteria, , International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, Switzerland; (1995) Ergonomics of the thermal environment: assessment of the influence of the thermal environment using subjective judgment scales, , International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, Switzerland; Jaakkola, J.J.K., Heinonen, O.P., Seppänen, O., Sick building syndrome, sensation of dryness and thermal comfort in relation to room temperature in an office building: need for individual control of temperature (1989) Environ Int, 15 (1-6), pp. 163-168; Karjalainen, S., Koistinen, O., User problems with individual temperature control in offices (2007) Build Environ, 42, pp. 2880-2887; Kroner, W.M., Employee productivity and the intelligent workplace (2000) Creating the productive workplace, pp. 296-303. , E&FN Spon, London, UK, D.

For instance, the language production architecture would be responsible for the retention of verbal materials such as a list of words (Acheson & MacDonald, 2009). However, evidence for the role of the motor system in object memory is still limited. In the present experiments, participants were asked to retain lists of objects in memory. During encoding, participants had to pantomime an action to grasp (Experiments 1A & 1B) or to use the objects (Experiment 2) that was either congruent or incongruent with the objects to be retained. The results showed that performing an incongruent action impaired memory performance compared to a congruent action. This suggests that motor affordances play a role during object retention. The results are discussed in light of the embodied cognition view. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Human Experimental Psychology (2300); Leanring and Memory (2343); Motor Processes (2330)","Acheson, D.J., MacDonald, M.C., Verbal working memory and language production: Common approaches to the serial ordering of verbal information (2009) Psychological Bulletin, 135, pp. 50-68;

Using pupil dilation as a proxy for immediate conflict arousal, we found that the same meaning violation (anomalous playing cards) evoked greater pupil dilation, and that this pupillary reaction was diminished in participants who earlier reported extreme beliefs.

Despite this recent interest, few studies have empirically evaluated the effects of parental migration on the psychosocial health of such children. Using data collected from a nationally-representative household survey conducted in Moldova between September 2011 and February 2012, this paper analyses the psychosocial health outcomes of children of migrant parents by comparing them with children without migrant parents (. n=1979). Child psychosocial health is measured through caregiver-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scores. Multivariate regression analyses show that parental migration seldom corresponds to worse emotional symptoms outcomes but does correspond to increased conduct problems. Separate analyses for male and female children show significant gendered differences. The results partially contest the negative results that have been the subject of qualitative reports and, in particular, demonstrate that the migration of mothers infrequently results in worse psychosocial outcomes for children-contrary to what has been assumed in the discourse about parental migration in Moldova. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Children; Children left behind; Migration; Moldova; Probit modelling; Psychosocial health","Achenbach, T.M., Edelbrock, C., Howell, C.T., Empirically-based assessment of the behavioral/emotional problems of 2- and 3-year-old children (1987) J.Abnorm.

Proponents of 'ecological rationality' have challenged the bleak view of human reasoning emerging from research on biases and fallacies. If we approach the human mind as an adaptive toolbox, tailored to the structure of the environment, many alleged biases and fallacies turn out to be artefacts of narrow norms and artificial set-ups. However, we argue that putative demonstrations of ecological rationality involve subtle locus shifts in attributions of rationality, conflating the adaptive rationale of heuristics with our own epistemic credentials. By contrast, other cases also involve an ecological reframing of human reason, but do not involve such problematic locus shifts. We discuss the difference between these cases, bringing clarity to the rationality debate. © 2014 .","Adaptation; Cognitive bias; Ecological rationality; Error management; Evolutionary psychology; Fallacies; Fast & frugal heuristics; Irrationality; Locus shifts","Adler, J.E., Abstraction is uncooperative (1984) Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, 14 (2), pp. 165-181; Aktipis, C.A., Kurzban, R., (2004) Is Homo economicus extinct?: Vernon Smith, Daniel Kahneman and the evolutionary perspective, pp. 135-153. , In R.

In addition, this work often relies on causal inferences drawn from empirical data collected on worker characteristics and their workplace outcomes. In this study, we demonstrate how tangible education and work history credentials - typically associated with supply-side characteristics - work in tandem with cultural beliefs about gender to influence the evaluative process that underlies venture capital decisions made in high-growth, high-tech entrepreneurship. Using an experimental design, we simulate funding decisions by venture capitalists (VCs) for men and women entrepreneurs that differ in technical background and the presence of important social ties. We demonstrate the presence of two distinct aspects of VCs' evaluation: that of the venture and that of the entrepreneur, and find that the gender of the entrepreneur influences evaluations most when the person, rather than the venture, is the target of evaluation. Technical background qualifications moderate the influence of gendered expectations, and women receive more of a payoff than men from having a close contact to the evaluating VC. We discuss the implications for future research on gender and work. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Gender; Gender bias; Social psychology; Technology; Venture capital","Acker, J., (1989) Doing Comparable Worth: Gender, Class and Pay Equity, , Temple University Press, Philadelphia, PA; Acker, J., Hierarchies, jobs, bodies: a theory of gendered organizations (1990) Gender Soc., 4, pp. 139-158; Adams, R.B., Funk, P., Beyond the glass ceiling: does gender matter?

Design: We used a 3×2 (Group×Time) experimental design over seven weeks with attributions, expectations of success, and persistence as dependent measures. Method: 49 novice participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment (attributional feedback) groups: (a) functional (i.e., controllable and unstable); (b) dysfunctional (i.e., uncontrollable and stable); or (c) no feedback. Testing involved three sessions, in which participants completed a total of five trials across two performance tasks (golf-putting and dart-throwing). In order to track whether the attributional manipulation conducted within the context of the golf-putting task in Session 2 would generalize to a new situation, participants performed a dart-throwing task in Session 3, and their scores were compared with those recorded at baseline (in Session 1). Results: Analysis of pre- and post-intervention measures of attributions, expectations, and persistence revealed that the functional attributional feedback led to more personally controllable attributions following failure in a golf-putting task, together with increases in success expectations and persistence. In contrast, dysfunctional attributional feedback led to more personally uncontrollable and stable attributions following failure, together with lower success expectations and reduced persistence. These effects extended beyond the intervention period, were present up to four weeks post intervention, and were maintained even when participants performed a different (i.e., dart-throwing) task. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that attributional feedback effects are durable over time and generalize across situations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Attributional feedback; Functional/dysfunctional attributions; Sport psychology","Abramson, L.Y., Seligman, M.E.P., Teasdale, J.D., Learned helplessness in humans: critique and reformulation (1978) Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 87 (1), pp. 49-74; Allen, M.S., Jones, M.V., Sheffield, D., Causal attribution and emotion in the days following competition (2009) Journal of Sports Sciences, 27 (5), pp. 461-468; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Boiché, J., Plaza, M., Chalabaev, A., Guillet, E., Sarrazin, P., Social antecedents and consequences of sport gender stereotypes during adolescence (2014) Psychology of Women Quarterly, 38, pp. 259-274; Coffee, P., Rees, T., The CSGU: a measure of controllability, stability, globality, and universality attributions (2008) Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology, 30, pp. 611-641; Coffee, P., Rees, T., When the chips are down: effects of attributional feedback on self-efficacy and task performance following initial and repeated failure (2011) Journal of Sports Sciences, 29, pp. 235-243; Coffee, P., Rees, T., Haslam, S.A., Bouncing back from failure: the interactive impact of perceived controllability and stability on self-efficacy beliefs and future task performance (2009) Journal of Sports Sciences, 27, pp. 1117-1124; Dieser, R.B., Ruddell, E., Effects of attribution retraining during therapeutic recreation on attributions and explanatory styles of adolescents with depression (2002) Therapeutic Recreation Journal, 36 (1), pp. 35-47; Fontayne, P., Martin-Krumm, C., Buton, F., Heuzé, J.-P., Validation française de la version révisée de l'échelle de mesure des attributions causales (CDS II) (2003) Les Cahiers Internationaux de Psychologie Sociale, 58, pp. 59-72; Gordon, R.A., Attributional style and athletic performance: strategic optimism and defensive pessimism (2008) Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 9, pp. 336-350; Hall, N.C., Perry, R.P., Chipperfield, J.G., Clifton, R.A., Haynes, T.L., Enhancing primary and secondary control in achievement settings through writing-based attributional retraining (2006) Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 25, pp. 361-391; Hall, N.C., Perry, R.P., Goetz, T., Ruthig, J.C., Stupnisky, R.H., Newall, N.E., Attributional retraining and elaborative learning: Improving academic development through writing-based interventions (2007) Learning and Individual Differences, 17, pp. 280-290; Haynes, T.L., Ruthig, J.C., Perry, R.P., Stupnisky, R.H., Hall, N.C., Reducing the academic risks of over-optimism: the longitudinal effects of attributional retraining on cognition and achievement (2006) Research in Higher Education, 47, pp. 755-779; Higgins, N.C., LaPointe, M.R.P., Academic attributional style predicts behavioral persistence under failure: factor structure and predictive validity of the Academic Attributional Style Questionnaire (2012) Sage Open (Psychology), 2, pp. 1-15; Jaycox, L.H., Reivich, K., Gillham, J., Seligman, M.E.P., Prevention of depressive symptoms in school children (1994) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 32, pp. 801-816; Johnson, L., Biddle, S.J.H., Persistence after failure: an exploratory look at ''learned helplessness'' in motor performance (1989) British Journal of Physical Education Research Supplement, 5, pp. 7-10; Le Foll, D., Rascle, O., Higgins, N.C., Persistence in a putting task during perceived failure: Influence of state-attributions and attributional style (2006) Applied Psychology: An International Review, 55, pp. 586-605; Le Foll, D., Rascle, O., Higgins, N.C., Attributional feedback-induced changes in functional and dysfunctional attributions, expectations of success, hopefulness, and short-term persistence in a novel sport (2008) Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 9, pp. 77-101; McAuley, E., Duncan, T., Russell, D., Measuring causal attributions: the revised Causal Dimension Scale (CDS II) (1992) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 18, pp. 566-573; Orbach, I., Singer, R.N., Murphey, M., Changing attributions with an attribution training technique related to basketball dribbling (1997) The Sport Psychologist, 11, pp. 294-304; Orbach, I., Singer, R.N., Price, S., An attribution training program and achievement in sport (1999) The Sport Psychologist, 13, pp. 69-82; Peterson, C., Park, C., Learned helplessness and explanatory styles (1998) Advanced personality, pp. 287-310. , Plenum Press, New York and London, D.F.

Based on participant-driven interviews during a UK social tourism trip, this paper informs understandings of social tourism experiences and explores the links between wellbeing and social tourism opportunities for older people. It reveals that social tourism presents older individuals with occasions for escape, respite, companionship, and reminiscence and for renegotiation of self-identity following spousal bereavement, but that these trips can be anxiously anticipated.

The aim of this study was to explore participants' experiences of non-adherence to Internet-delivered psychological treatment. Grounded theory was used to analyze data from seven in-depth interviews with persons who had non-adhered to a study on Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for generalized anxiety disorder. The process of non-adherence is described as an interaction between patient factors and treatment factors. A working model theory was generated to illustrate the experience of nonadherence. The model describes a process where treatment features such as workload, text-content complexity and treatment process don't match personal prerequisites regarding daily routines, perceived language skills and treatment expectations respectively, resulting in the decision to nonadhere. Negative effects were also stated as a reason for non-adherence. Several common strategies used for increasing adherence to Internet-delivered therapy in general are by these non-completers regarded as factors directly related to their reason for non-adherence. © 2015.","Attrition; Behavior therapy; Cognitive behavior therapy; Generalized anxiety disorder; Internet treatment; Non-adherence; Self-help","Andersson, G., Using the Internet to provide cognitive behaviour therapy (2009) Behav.

Access to greenness is potentially more important in vulnerable subgroups. In this study based on longitudinal survey data from southern Sweden the cohort was divided into prognostic groups for good self-reported general (n=8891) and mental (n=9444) health. We used independent survey data to assess perceived neighbourhood greenness in 1km2 areas, and estimated effects of changing exposure longitudinally stratified by prognostic group. The overall effect on health was small and statistically uncertain (for general health OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98-1.10, for mental health OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00-1.14). A more beneficial effect of increased greenness was indicated among subjects with lowest prognostic of good general health (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01-1.52). The study provided only weak evidence for beneficial effects of increased neighbourhood greenness triggered by changing residence. It seems that altered life circumstances, e.g. changed civil or socioeconomic status that often trigger a decision to move, are also the key determinants of the health consequences of changing residence. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","General health; Green quality; Longitudinal data; Mental health; Neighborhood perceptions","Alcock, I., White, M.P., Wheeler, B.W., Fleming, L.E., Depledge, M.H., Longitudinal effects on mental health of moving to greener and less green urban areas (2014) Environ.

However, most studies have been constrained by cross-sectional designs that limit causal inference due to failing to establish temporal order of exposure and disease. We tested the impact of baseline neighborhood context (neighborhood socioeconomic status factor at the block-group level, and relative income of individuals compared to their neighbors) on allostatic load two years later. We leveraged data from the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study, a prospective cohort of aging Puerto Rican adults (aged 45-75 at baseline), with change in AL modeled between baseline and the 2nd wave of follow-up using two-level hierarchical linear regression models. Puerto Rican adults with higher income, relative to their neighbors, exhibited lower AL after two years, after adjusting for NSES, age, gender, individual-level SES, length of residence, and city. After additional control for baseline AL, this association was attenuated to marginal significance. We found no significant association of NSES with AL. Longitudinal designs are an important tool to understand how neighborhood contexts influence health and health disparities. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Allostatic load; Neighborhood context; Puerto ricans; Relative income","Alegria, M., Molina, K.M., Chen, C.N., Neighborhood characteristics and differential risk for depressive and anxiety disorders across racial/ethnic groups in the United States (2014) Depress.

We present an experiment, conducted between June and September 2012, that directly compares the effects of those two different monetary incentive schemes on eating behaviour: we evaluate incentives to eat against incentives not to eat. A large number of participants (n=353) had bowls of sweets next to them while they watched different videos over two experimental sessions that were two days apart. Sweets eating was monitored and monetary incentives to eat or not to eat were introduced during one of the videos for participants randomly allocated to these conditions. Our results show that, while both types of incentives were effective in changing sweets-eating behaviour when they were in place, only incentives not to eat had significant carryover effects after they were removed. Those effects were still significant two days after the monetary incentives had been eliminated. We also present some additional results on personality and health-related variables that shed further light on these effects. Overall, our study shows that incentives not to eat can be more effective in producing carryover effects on behaviour in domains like the one explored here. © 2015.","Behavioural economics; Carryover effects; Crowding out of intrinsic motivation; Eating behaviour; Experimental economics; Monetary incentives; Obesity; United Kingdom","Abramson, E.A., Stinson, G.S., Boredom and eating in obese and non-obese individuals (1977) Addict.

Our belief is that emotion and self-expression through movement play a key role in the development of child art, and that this may be already visible during the scribbling stage of drawing. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Child art education; Child graphical development; Children's drawings; Early childhood; Scribbling","Anning, A., Learning to draw and drawing to learn (1999) Journal of Art & Design Education, 18 (2), pp. 163-172; Anning, A., Ring, K., (2004) Making sense of children's drawings, , Open University Press, Maidenhead, UK; Arnheim, R., (1954) Art and visual perception: A psychology of the creative eye, , Faber & Faber, London, England; Callaghan, T., Early understanding and production of graphic symbols (1999) Child Development, 70 (6), pp. 1314-1324; Dunst, C., Gorman, E., Development of infant and toddler mark making and scribbling (2009) Cell Reviews, 2 (2), pp. 1-16. , http://www.earlyliteracylearning.org/cellreviews/cellreviews_v2_n2.pdf, retrieved from; Ebersbach, M., Stiehler, S., Asmus, P., On the relationship between children's perspective taking in complex scenes and their spatial drawing ability (2011) British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 29, pp. 455-474; Einarsdottir, J., Dockett, S., Perry, B., Making meaning: Children's perspectives expressed through drawings (2009) Early Child Development and Care, 179 (2), pp. 217-232; Freeman, N.H., (1980) Strategies of representation in young children: Analysis of spatial skills and drawing processes, , Academic Press, London, England; Freeman, N.H., Janikoun, R., Intellectual realism in children's drawings of a familiar object with distinct features (1972) Child Development, 43 (1), pp. 116-121; Gardner, H., (1980) Artful scribbles: The significance of children's drawings, , Basic Books, New York, NY; Gardner, H., (1982) Art, mind and brain, , Basic Books, New York, NY; Golomb, C., (1990) The child's creation of a pictorial world, , University of California Press, Berkeley, CA; Golomb, C., (2002) Child art in context: A cultural and comparative perspective, , American Psychological Association, Washington, DC; Goodenough, F., (1926) Measurement of intelligence by drawings, , Harcourt, Brace & World, New York, NY; Goodman, N., (1976) Languages of art: An approach to a theory of symbols, , Oxford University Press, London, England; Goodnow, J.J., (1977) Children drawing, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; Harris, D.B., (1963) Children's drawings as measures of intellectual maturity a revision and extension of the good enough Draw-A-Man test, , Harcourt, Brace & World, New York, NY; Hochberg, J., The representation of things and persons (1972) Perception and reality, pp. 47-94. , Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD, E.H.

We assessed the impact of MCC review of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers at a stand-alone cancer center. Methods: Patient data were prospectively collected on consecutive cases presented at a GI MCC during a 6-month period. Original treatment plans were collected confidentially before presentation and compared to post-MCC treatment plans. We defined changes in management plans as major (change in treatment modality) or minor (testing prior to original plan). Results: A total of 149 cases were evaluated: 115 upper GI (gastric/small bowel—10 %, liver—32 %, pancreaticobiliary—36 %), and 34 lower GI (23 %). Reasons for presentation were: questions regarding progression/metastases (44 %), management (26 %), diagnosis (21 %), pathology (15 %), and resectability (7 %). Physicians were certain of their original plans being the final recommendations in 84 % (n = 125). Change in management was recommended in 36 %; 72 % were major and 28 % were minor. Patients underwent all recommended treatments at our institution in 77 % of cases, a portion in 5 %, and no recommended treatments in 18 %. On multivariate analysis, physician degree of certainty for original management plan was not predictive of a change in management plan (p = 0.61). Conclusions: Although certainty of prediscussion treatment plan is high, changes in treatment recommendations occurred in more than one-third of patients after GI MCC. This prospective study demonstrates the value of MCC in GI cancer sites, even at a stand-alone cancer center. © 2014, Society of Surgical Oncology.",,"Fleissig, A., Jenkins, V., Catt, S., Fallowfield, L., Multidisciplinary teams in cancer care: are they effective in the UK?

Positive resolution i.e., the positive correlation between choice-correctness and choice-confidence is a critical property of confidence judgments, which justifies their ubiquity. In the current paper, we study the mechanism underlying confidence judgments and their resolution by investigating the source of the inputs for the confidence-calculation. We focus on the intriguing debate between two families of confidence theories. According to single stage theories, confidence is based on the same information that underlies the decision (or on some other aspect of the decision process), whereas according to dual stage theories, confidence is affected by novel information that is collected after the decision was made. In three experiments, we support the case for dual stage theories by showing that post-choice perceptual availability manipulations exert a causal effect on confidence-resolution in the decision followed by confidence paradigm. These finding establish the role of RT2, the duration of the post-choice information-integration stage, as a prime dependent variable that theories of confidence should account for. We then present a novel list of robust empirical patterns ('hurdles') involving RT2 to guide further theorizing about confidence judgments. Finally, we present a unified computational dual stage model for choice, confidence and their latencies namely, the collapsing confidence boundary model (CCB). According to CCB, a diffusion-process choice is followed by a second evidence-integration stage towards a stochastic collapsing confidence boundary. Despite its simplicity, CCB clears the entire list of hurdles. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Collapsing boundaries; Confidence; Decision making; Perception; Resolution of confidence","Ahn, W.Y., Busemeyer, J.R., Wagenmakers, E.J., Stout, J.C., Comparison of decision learning models using the generalization criterion method (2008) Cognitive Science, 32 (8), pp. 1376-1402; Ariely, D., Au, W.T., Bender, R.H., Budescu, D.V., Dietz, C.B., Gu, H., The effects of averaging subjective probability estimates between and within judges (2000) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 6, pp. 130-147; Audley, R.J., A stochastic model for individual choice behavior (1960) Psychological Review, 67, pp. 1-15; Baranski, J.V., Petrusic, W.M., The calibration and resolution of confidence in perceptual judgments (1994) Perception & Psychophysics, 55, pp. 412-428; Baranski, J.V., Petrusic, W.M., Probing the locus of confidence judgments: Experiments on the time to determine confidence (1998) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 24, pp. 929-945; Baranski, J.V., Petrusic, W.M., Testing architectures of the decision-confidence relation (2001) Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology, 55, pp. 195-206; Borenstein, M., Hedges, L.V., Higgins, J.P., Rothstein, H.R., (2011) Introduction to meta-analysis, , John Wiley & Sons; Botvinick, M.M., Braver, T.S., Barch, D.M., Carter, C.S., Cohen, J.D., Conflict monitoring and cognitive control (2001) Psychological Review, 108 (3), pp. 624-652; Brainard, D.H., The psychophysics toolbox (1997) Spatial Vision, 10, pp. 433-436; Brier, G.W., Verification of forecasts expressed in terms of probability (1950) Monthly Weather Review, 78, pp. 1-3; Brown, S.D., Heathcote, A., The simplest complete model of choice response time: Linear ballistic accumulation (2008) Cognitive Psychology, 57, pp. 153-178; Busemeyer, J.R., Wang, Y.M., Model comparisons and model selections based on generalization criterion methodology (2000) Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 44 (1), pp. 171-189; Deneve, S., Making decisions with unknown sensory reliability (2012) Frontiers in Neuroscience, 6; Dobson, A.J., Barnett, A.G., (2008) An introduction to generalized linear models, , Chapman and Hall/CRC, Taylor & Francis Group; Dougherty, M.R.P., Integration of the ecological and error models of overconfidence using a multiple-trace memory model (2001) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 130, pp. 579-599; Drugowitsch, J., Moreno-Bote, R., Churchland, A.K., Shadlen, M.N., Pouget, A., The cost of accumulating evidence in perceptual decision making (2012) The Journal of Neuroscience, 32 (11), pp. 3612-3628; Egan, J.P., Schulman, A.I., Greenberg, G.Z., Operating characteristics determined by binary decisions and by ratings (1959) Journal of Acoustical Society of America, 31, pp. 768-773; Galvin, S.J., Podd, J.V., Drga, V., Whitmore, J., Type 2 tasks in the theory of signal detectability: Discrimination between correct and incorrect decisions (2003) Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 10 (4), pp. 843-876; Garrett, H.E., A study of the relation of accuracy to speed (1922) Archives of Psychology, 56, pp. 1-105; Gold, J.I., Shadlen, M.N., The neural basis of decision making (2007) Annual Review of Neuroscience, 30, pp. 535-574; Goodman, L.A., Kruskal, W.H., Measures of association for cross classifications (1954) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 49, pp. 732-769; Hawkins, G.E., Forstmann, B.U., Wagenmakers, E.-J., Ratcliff, R., Brown, S.D., Revisiting the evidence for collapsing boundaries and urgency signals in perceptual decision-making (2015) The Journal of Neuroscience, 35 (6), pp. 2476-2484; Jentzsch, I., Dudschig, C., Why do we slow down after an error?

This study aimed to add to the evidence regarding the effectiveness of CBT when delivered in a routine clinical setting. The participants were 203 adults presenting with a range of eating disorder diagnoses, who were offered CBT in an out-patient community eating disorders service in the UK. Patients completed measures of eating disorder pathology at the start of treatment, following the sixth session, and at the end of treatment. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and psychosocial functioning were measured pre- and post-treatment. Approximately 55% of patients completed treatment, and there were no factors that predicted attrition. There were significant improvements in eating disorder psychopathology, anxiety, depression and general functioning, with particular changes in eating attitudes in the early part of therapy. Effect sizes were medium to large for both completer and intention to treat analyses. These findings confirm that evidence-based forms of CBT can be delivered with strong outcomes in routine clinical settings. Clinicians should be encouraged to deliver evidence-based treatments when working in these settings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Attrition; Cognitive-behavioural therapy; Eating disorders; Effectiveness","Agras, W.S., Crow, S.J., Halmi, K.A., Mitchell, J.E., Wilson, G.T., Kraemer, H.C., Outcome predictors for the cognitive behavior treatment of bulimia nervosa: data from a multisite study (2000) American Journal of Psychiatry, 157, pp. 1302-1308; (1994) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM- IV, , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC; Barkham, M., Gilbert, N., Connell, J., Marshall, C., Twigg, E., Suitability and utility of the CORE-OM and CORE-A for assessing severity of presenting problems in psychological therapy services based in primary and secondary care settings (2005) British Journal of Psychiatry, 186, pp. 239-246; Barkham, M., Margison, F., Leach, C., Lucock, M., Mellor-Clark, J., Evans, C., Service profiling and outcomes benchmarking using the CORE-OM: toward practice-based evidence in the psychological therapies (2001) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 69, pp. 184-196; Berg, K.C., Peterson, C.B., Frazier, P., Crow, S.J., Psychometric evaluation of the eating disorder examination and eating disorder examination-questionnaire: a systematic review of the literature (2012) International Journal of Eating Disorders, 45, pp. 428-438; Black, C., Wilson, G.T., Assessment of eating disorders: Interview versus questionnaire (1996) International Journal of Eating Disorders, 20, pp. 43-50; Bohn, K., Doll, H.A., Cooper, Z., O'Connor, M.E., Palmer, R.L., Fairburn, C.G., The measurement of impairment due to eating disorder psychopathology (2008) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 46, pp. 1105-1110; Bohn, K., Fairburn, C.G., Clinical Impairment Assessment questionnaire (CIA 3.0) (2008) Cognitive behavior therapy and eating disorders, pp. 315-317. , Guilford, New York, NY, C.G.

In a series of five experiments, we ask children about their own and others' freedom of choice and about the physical and mental circumstances that place limitations on that freedom. We begin with three experiments establishing a basis for this understanding at age four. We find that 4-year-olds endorse their own and others' ability to ""do otherwise"" only when they or others are free to choose a course of action, but not when others' actions are physically impossible (Experiment 1), their own actions are physically constrained (Experiment 2), and their own actions are epistemically constrained (Experiment 3). We then examine developmental changes in children's understanding of actions and alternatives that lead to more adult-like free will intuitions. Across two experiments, 6-year-olds, but not 4-year-olds, endorse another person's (Experiment 4) or their own (Experiment 5) freedom to act against stated desires. These age-related changes suggest relationships between a belief in free will and other cognitive and conceptual developments in theory of mind, self-control and self-awareness that take place in early childhood. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Agency; Cognitive development; Counterfactual reasoning; Free will; Social cognition; Theory of mind","Bååth, R., ChildFreq: An online tool to explore word frequencies in child language (2010) LUCS Minor, p. 16; Baumeister, R.F., Mele, A.R., Vohs, K.D., (2010) Free will and consciousness: How might they work?, , Oxford University Press, New York, US; Beck, S.R., Robinson, E.J., Carroll, D.J., Apperly, I.A., Children's thinking about counterfactuals and future hypotheticals as possibilities (2006) Child Development, 77 (2), pp. 413-426; Behne, T., Carpenter, M., Call, J., Tomasello, M., Unwilling versus unable: Infants' understanding of intentional action (2005) Developmental Psychology, 41, pp. 328-337; Blakemore, S., Frith, C., Self-awareness and action (2003) Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 13 (2), pp. 219-224; Brandone, A.C., Wellman, H.M., You can't always get what you want: Infants understand failed goal-directed actions (2009) Psychological Science, 20 (1), pp. 85-91; Bratman, M., (1987) Intention, plans, and practical reason, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass; Browne, C.A., Woolley, J.D., Preschoolers' magical explanations for violations of physical, social, and mental laws (2004) Journal of Cognition and Development, 5 (2), pp. 239-260; Carlson, S.M., (2010) Development of conscious control and imagination, pp. 135-152. , Oxford University Press, New York, NY US, R.F.

The efficacy of such groups can be understood by the effects they have on members' social identity and also through associated group processes. The current paper introduces the Social Identity Model of Cessation Maintenance (SIMCM). Methods: The SIMCM outlines how a number of processes (including self/collective efficacy and esteem, normative structure and social support and control) may affect cessation maintenance. It also provides a framework to make predictions about how automatic and/or implicit processes influence the activation of addiction relevant identities through cognitive accessibility and complexity in particular. Results: A review of initial empirical evidence supporting some of the key specified relationships is provided, along with potential applications in therapy settings. Conclusions: Insights into how SIMCM could be generalized beyond treatment contexts and avenues for future research are outlined. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Addiction; Automaticity; Identity; Implicit; Recovery; Social","Abrams, D., Marques, J., Bown, N., Dougill, M., Anti-norm and pro-norm deviance in the bank and on the campus: Two experiments on subjective group dynamics (2002) Group Processes & Intergroup Relations, 5, pp. 163-182; Abrams, D., Marques, J.M., Brown, N., Henson, M., Pro-norm and anti-norm deviance within and between groups (2000) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78, pp. 906-912; (2001) Alcoholics Anonymous, , Alcoholics Anonymous, A.A.

In this study, we examined the feasibility of a web-based program enabling professional support of patients with chronic conditions in their daily functioning. Method: A triangulated research method was applied involving a combination of the results of semi-structured interviews and standardized questionnaires. We conducted face-to-face interviews with clients (. n=. 11) and telephone interviews with coaches (. n=. 10) on their initial experiences with the program. In addition, clients took an online pre-test (. n=. 39) - post-test questionnaire (. n=. 30) which measured quality of life, empowerment, mastery, social cohesion and satisfaction with care. Clients and coaches both received a questionnaire to report on the perceived usability of the program. Results: Clients and coaches used the program and were positive about this new way of communicating. Clients were pleased that they could contact the coach at any time and experienced increased control over the support they received. Coaches reported positive effects on the levels of independence among clients, saved time and experienced greater flexibility in their scheduling. The implementation of the program did not lead to changes in quality of life, empowerment, mastery, social cohesion or satisfaction with care. Clients and coaches reported that the usability of the MPC could be improved through the use of an enhanced Internet connection. Conclusion: The initial results of the use of web-based support for this client population seem promising and justify further research on online support for clients with mild intellectual disabilities or chronic psychiatric disorders. © 2015 .","Chronic psychiatric disorders; Feasibility; Intellectual disability; Online support","Andersson, G., Cuijpers, P., Carlbring, P., Riper, H., Hedman, E., Guided Internet-based vs. face-to-face cognitive behaviour therapy for psychiatric and somatic disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis (2014) World Psychiatry, 13 (3), pp. 288-295; Andrews, G., Cuijpers, P., Craske, M.G., McEvoy, P., Titov, N., Computer therapy for the anxiety and depressive disorders is effective, acceptable and practical health care: a meta-analysis (2010) PLoS ONE, 5 (10), p. e13196; Bangor, A., Kortum, P.T., Miller, J.T., An empirical evaluation of the System Usability Scale (2008) Int.

Methods: Women with endometrial cancer completed a survey around the time of diagnosis and again 3–5 years later. The follow-up survey asked women about their physical and psychosocial functioning and supportive care needs (CaSUN). Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression identified the predictors and correlates of women’s unmet needs 3–5 years after diagnosis. Results: Of the 629 women who completed the cancer survivors’ unmet needs measure (CaSUN), 24 % (n = 153) women reported one or more unmet supportive care needs in the last month. Unmet needs at 3–5 years post-diagnosis were predicted by younger age (OR = 4.47; 95 % CI: 2.09–9.56) and advanced disease stage at diagnosis (OR = 2.47; 95 % CI: 1.38–4.45) and correlated with greater cancer symptoms (OR = 1.78; 95 % CI: 1.05–3.02), lower limb swelling (OR = 2.50; 95 % CI: 1.51–4.15), symptoms of anxiety (OR = 2.21; 95 % CI: 1.31–3.72), and less availability of social support (OR = 3.42; 95 % CI: 1.92–6.11). Women with a history of comorbidities (OR = 0.47; 95 % CI: 0.27–0.82) and those living in a rural area at the time of diagnosis (OR = 0.56; 95 % CI: 0.34–0.92) were less likely to report unmet needs. Conclusions: Sociodemographic, health, and psychosocial factors seem important for identifying women who will or will not have unmet needs several years following endometrial cancer. Longitudinal assessments of people’s needs over the course of their cancer trajectory may be an effective way to identify areas that should receive further attention by health providers. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Endometrial cancer; Gynecological cancer; Psychosocial; Supportive care needs","Amant, F., Moerman, P., Neven, P., Timmerman, D., Van Limbergen, E., Vergote, I., Endometrial cancer (2005) Lancet, 366, pp. 491-505. , PID: 16084259; Armes, J., Crowe, M., Colbourne, L., Morgan, H., Murrells, T., Oakley, C., Palmer, N., Richardson, A., Patients’ supportive care needs beyond the end of cancer treatment: a prospective, longitudinal survey (2009) J Clin Oncol, 27, pp. 6172-6179. , PID: 19884548; Beesley, V., Eakin, E., Steginga, S., Aitken, J., Dunn, J., Battistutta, D., Unmet needs of gynaecological cancer survivors: implications for developing community support services (2008) Psycho-Oncology, 17, pp. 392-400. , PID: 17680554; Beesley, V., Janda, M., Eakin, E., Obermair, A., Battistutta, D., Lymphedema after gynecological cancer treatment: prevalence, correlates, and supportive care needs (2007) Cancer, 109, pp. 2607-2614. , PID: 17474128; Beesley, V.L., Price, M.A., Webb, P.M., O'Rourke, P., Marquart, L., Butow, P.N., Changes in supportive care needs after first-line treatment for ovarian cancer: identifying care priorities and risk factors for future unmet needs (2013) Psycho-Oncology, 22, pp. 1565-1571; Boyes, A., Girgis, A., Lecathelinais, C., Brief assessment of adult cancer patients’ perceived needs: development and validation of the 34-item Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS-SF34) (2009) J Eval Clin Pract, 15, pp. 602-606. , PID: 19522727; Butow, P.N., Phillips, F., Schweder, J., White, K., Underhill, C., Goldstein, D., Psychosocial well-being and supportive care needs of cancer patients living in urban and rural/regional areas: a systematic review (2012) Support Care Cancer Off J Multinatl Assoc Support Care Cancer, 20, pp. 1-22; Carlson, L.E., Waller, A., Mitchell, A.J., Screening for distress and unmet needs in patients with cancer: review and recommendations (2012) J Clin Oncol, 30, pp. 1160-1177. , PID: 22412146; Cella, D.F., Tulsky, D.S., Gray, G., Sarafian, B., Linn, E., Bonomi, A., Silberman, M., Brannon, J., The functional assessment of cancer therapy scale: development and validation of the general measure (1993) J Clin Oncol, 11, pp. 570-579. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK3s7oslKqsQ%3D%3D, PID: 8445433; Charlson, M., Szatrowski, T.P., Peterson, J., Gold, J., Validation of a combined comorbidity index (1994) J Clin Epidemiol, 47, pp. 1245-1251. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK2M3jvFantQ%3D%3D, PID: 7722560; Eaker, S., Bergstrom, R., Bergstrom, A., Adami, H.O., Nyren, O., Response rate to mailed epidemiologic questionnaires: a population-based randomized trial of variations in design and mailing routines (1998) Am J Epidemiol, 147, pp. 74-82. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK1c7gtlGrtw%3D%3D, PID: 9440402; Finnane, A., Hayes, S.C., Obermair, A., Janda, M., Quality of life of women with lower-limb lymphedema following gynecological cancer (2011) Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res, 11, pp. 287-297. , PID: 21671698; Fiszer, C., Dolbeault, S., Sultan, S., Bredart, A., Prevalence, intensity, and predictors of the supportive care needs of women diagnosed with breast cancer: a systematic review (2014) Psycho-Oncology, 23, pp. 361-374. , PID: 24677334; Harrison, J.D., Young, J.M., Price, M.A., Butow, P.N., Solomon, M.J., What are the unmet supportive care needs of people with cancer?

We analyzed hedonic, psychological, and social well-being in a sample of 1250 immigrants from Bolivia, Colombia, Morocco, Romania and Sub-Saharan Africa, together with that of 500 matched host nationals from Spain. Participants were selected by means of probability sampling with stratification by age and sex. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that the re-specified tripartite model of well-being, including hedonic, psychological, and social components of the individual's functioning, was the best fitting model, as compared to alternative models. Importantly, after adjustment for perceived friendship and support, marital status, income, sex and age, immigrants presented higher levels of well-being than host nationals. Compared to host nationals, immigrants reported especially higher eudaimonic well-being: social contribution and actualization, personal growth, self-acceptance, and purpose in life, and lower levels of well-being only in terms of positive relations with others and negative affect. These results are discussed in the context of positive psychology. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Hedonic well-being; Immigrant; Income; Psychological well-being; Social support; Social well-being","Abbott, R.A., Ploubidis, G.B., Huppert, F.A., Kuh, D., Wadsworth, M.E.J., Croudace, T.J., Psychometric evaluation and predictive validity of Ryff's psychological well-being items in a UK birth cohort sample of women (2006) Health Qual.

However, prior work has unfortunately been restricted primarily to considerations of slurs that typically target females, homosexuals, and African Americans. This is problematic because such a narrowly focused attention to slurs in prior work has left theorizing of how slurs generally function relatively uninformed by facts of actual language use. As a result, theoretical accounts of slurs that have so far been proposed have largely failed to accurately reflect actual usage, account for the empirical findings about slurs and general pejoratives from the social sciences, and offer any informative predictions to help guide future research. At this time more empirically oriented homework on the variety of ways that different slurs have been used in different cases would be helpful for theorists to consider so that they can proceed to develop more nuanced and empirically informed theories about slurs, their usage, and their effects. Accordingly, since no account of slurs for Italian Americans has so far been offered, this article provides a systematic and empirically informed analysis of slurs for Italian Americans that accounts for both their derogatory and appropriative use. Further, this article demonstrates that the family resemblance account of slurs maintained here has major advantages over previous accounts insofar as it is flexible yet robust enough to accommodate both the derogatory and appropriative use of slurs, can explain many of the psychological effects that slurs actually have on both their users and targets, and is more in accord with the real rather than ideal nature of our organic human psychology. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Appropriation; Italian; Pragmatics; Semantics; Slurs; Stereotypes","Adler, S.H., (2008) Justice Defeated: Victims: OJ Simpson and the American Legal System, , AuthorHouse, Bloomington; Alba, R.D., (2009) Blurring the Color Line: The New Chance for a More Integrated America, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge; Aldridge, K., Slurs often adopted by those they insult (2001) The Cincinnati Enquirer, , http://enquirer.com/editions/2001/08/05/loc_2slurs_often_adopted.html, 5 August; Alim, H.S., Lee, J., Carris, L., ""Short fried-rice-eating Chinese MCs"" and ""good hair-havin uncle Tom niggas"": performing race and ethnicity in freestyle rap battles (2010) J.

These stimuli inflict a strong illusion of a novel face on their viewers, and are often considered to be processed holistically. The current study challenges this holistic view. Here I present provocative evidence from various classic attention paradigms such as the Garner (1974) and the redundant target (Miller, Cognitive Psychology, 14, 247–279, 1982; Townsend & Nozawa, Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 39, 321–359, 1995) tasks showing that face parts are perceived and processed in an analytic rather than holistic fashion. In Experiment 1, composite faces failed to exhibit Garner interference, indicating perfect selective attention to the constituent parts. In Experiments 2 and 3, composite faces failed to exhibit super-capacity with same-identity composites, demonstrating limited or unlimited capacity. This pattern is consistent with analytic perception. Taken together, the results cast serious doubts on the validity of the holistic processing approach. In many respects, the study proposes disillusionment from the composite face illusion. In addition, the study highlights the importance of converging operations, model testability, and individual differences in the study of faces. © 2015 The Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Face recognition",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928660415

At present only three of these domains have been studied from an empirical perspective, leaving Body as the one domain requiring further analysis. Given this state of affairs, the purpose of the present study is to determine the everyday and theoretical meanings of body. To accomplish this task participants coded randomly selected body- related words into groups on the basis of having similar meanings. Once these groupings were established they were then evaluated by statistical clustering and multidimensional scaling procedures. Results indicated that it was possible to define the everyday meaning of the human experience of the human body in terms of the following set of themes: (1) inside/outside, (2) visible/not visible, (3) vitality and activity, (4) instrument and object and (5) appearance and self-expression. Concerns about the representativeness of the words studied led to the development and use of individual word pools from which a set of 50 partially different words was randomly selected for each participant. Results indicated little difference between themes produced in the present study when compared with those of an earlier study. The specific themes derived from the present study were then related to embodiment issues as reflected in the philosophical writings of Merleau-Ponty, the psycholinguistic analyses of Lakoff and Johnson and experimental psychology. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Body; Dialogue as method; Embodied cognition; Phenomenology",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928665550

Several authors have called for a better understanding of the processes by which healthcare students develop their professional identities, and suggested helpful theoretical frameworks borrowed from the social science and psychology literature. However to our knowledge, there has been little empirical work examining these processes in actual healthcare students, and we are aware of no data driven description of PSI development in healthcare students. Here, we report a data driven model of PSI formation in healthcare students. Methods: We interviewed 17 student doctors and dentists who had indicated, on a tracking questionnaire, the most substantial changes in their PSI. We analysed their perceptions of the experiences that had influenced their PSI, to develop a descriptive model. Both the primary coder and the secondary coder considered the data without reference to the existing literature; i.e. we used a bottom up approach rather than a top down approach. Results: The results indicate that two overlapping frames of reference affect PSI formation: the students' self-perception and their perception of the professional role. They are 'learning' both; neither is static. Underpinning those two learning processes, the following key mechanisms operated: [1] When students are allowed to participate in the professional role they learn by trying out their knowledge and skill in the real world and finding out to what extent they work, and by trying to visualise themselves in the role. [2] When others acknowledge students as quasi-professionals they experience transference and may respond with counter-transference by changing to meet expectations or fulfil a prototype. [3] Students may also dry-run their professional role (i.e., independent practice of professional activities) in a safe setting when invited. Conclusions: Students' experiences, and their perceptions of those experiences, can be evaluated through a simple model that describes and organises the influences and mechanisms affecting PSI. This empirical model is discussed in the light of prevalent frameworks from the social science and psychology literature. © 2015 Vivekananda-Schmidt et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Healthcare; Medical; Model; Professional Identity; Professionalism",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928792996

We examined associations of traumatic events (TEs) and current stressors with mental disorder and functioning, amongst 230 West Papuan refugees residing in six settlements in Port Morseby, Papua New Guinea (PNG). We used culturally adapted modules to assess exposure to TEs and mental disorders. Current stressors and functioning were assessed using modifications of measures developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). 129 of 230 respondents (56%) reported exposure to at least one traumatic event (TE), including: political upheaval (36.5%), witnessing or hearing about family members tortured and murdered (33.9%), and not being able to access medical care for family members (33%). One fifth of respondents (47, 20.4%) experienced exposure to high levels of TEs (16 to 23). 211 (91.7%) endorsed at least one or more ongoing stressors, including: exposure to illicit substance use in the community (91.7%), problems with safety and the protection of women (89.6%), no access to legal rights and citizenship (88.3%), and lack of adequate shelter and facilities (85.2%). A quarter (26.9%) met criteria for one or more current mental disorder, and 69.1%reported functional impairment ranging from mild to extreme. Mental disorder was associated with being male (adjusted odds ratio=2.00; 95% CI=1.01-3.97), and exposure to the highest category of ongoing stressors (AOR=2.89; 95% CI=1.08-7.72). The TE count showed a doseresponse pattern in its relationship with functional impairment, the greatest risk (AOR=11.47; 95% CI=2.11-62.37) being for those experiencing the highest level of TE exposure (16-23 events). West Papuans living in settlements in Port Moresby reported a range of TEs, ongoing stressors and associated mental disorders characteristic of populations exposed to mass conflict and persecution, prolonged displacement, and ongoing conditions of extreme hardship. © 2015 Tay et al.",,"Rees, Van De Pas, R., Silove, D., Kareth, M., Health and human security in West Papua (2008) Med J Aust, 189 (11-12), pp. 641-643. , PMID: 19012564; Rees, S., Silove, D., Speaking out about human rights and health in West Papua (2007) Lancet, 370 (9588), pp. 637-639. , PMID: 17719999; Rees, S., Silove, D.M., Tay, K., Kareth, M., Human rights trauma and the mental health of West Papuan refugees resettled in Australia (2013) The Medical Journal of Australia, 199 (4), pp. 280-283. , Epub 2013/08/30.

Particularly, it asks whether in light of the overhomogenization of the term “qualitative methods” researchers actually can still assume that they talk about the same thing when using this terminology. In addressing the topic of what constitutes the object of psychological research and what accordingly could be a genuinely psychological qualitative research it acknowledges the need to return to the study of persons’ unique experience. In light of the risk of “McDonaldization” in present qualitative research, it argues that we need to return to learning research methods as craft skills. It will then give an outlook on how recent developments in discursive and narrative psychology offer a fruitful avenue for studying unique psychological experience as people manage to ‘move on’ in a material world and in irreversible time. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Craft skills; Future; Language practices; Psychology; Qualitative methods; Unique experience",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928473478

Two distinct populations are addressed – children with intellectual disability and deaf children without related disabilities – with the aim of identifying the main methodological issues and proposing arrangements to encourage them to express themselves during research interviews. It transpires that the common features between interviews conducted with these two populations relate to the need to get to know the child and his or her environment, resort to visual aids and manage as best one can the investigative relation. The differences between these two populations hinge around both communication (the difficulties experienced by the children in understanding and/or expression) and how the interview is conducted (social desirability shown by the children and strategies in conducting the interview by the researcher). © 2015 Taylor & Francis","deafness; intellectual disability; psychology; qualitative research interview; sociology",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928679186

Yet, up to the mid-1990s, a large number of experimental reports questioned whether the NP effect is based on attentional inhibition and/or episodic retrieval processes. In this review, we summarize findings since the mid-1990s and discuss new and old theoretical approaches to Negative Priming. We conclude that more than one process contributes to NP and that future research should analyze the conditions under which a particular process contributes to NP. Moreover, we argue that the paradigm – although it does not measure a single cognitive process alone – is still a useful tool for understanding selection in cognition. In fact, it might be a virtue of the paradigm that several cognitive processes work here together as selection in nonexperimental contexts is surely a multidimensional process. From this perspective, research on NP is relevant for all research fields analyzing selection. We therefore close our review by discussing the implications of the new evidence on NP for theories of selective attention. © 2015 Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Attention; Memory; Negative priming; Selective attention",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928601176

This study was designed as an attempt to understand the nature of sport and sport-based youth development in the community of the Kayamandi Township in South Africa. Three topics related to sport-based youth development in a South African Xhosa township were examined: (a) required competencies for young people to develop in order to have a happy and productive life; (b) competencies acquired by young people through sport participation; and (c) transferable competencies from the sport domain into the everyday lives of young people. A phenomenological methodology was used by gathering participants’ perceptions and meanings through semi-structured interviews. Individual interviews were conducted with 10 coaches, 11 community members, and 19 athletes, with the data analysed through independent comprehensive inductive content analysis with constant comparison and critical reflection. The results of this investigation identified specific competencies developed through sport and transferred out of the sport domain, including the southern African philosophy of ubuntu (e.g. respect and caring for others), self-concept, self-discipline, and group skills. These competencies may help young people prepare to overcome the challenges of growing up in this community. The community-driven nature of the study allowed culturally relevant topics to emerge from the data, thus highlighting the need for community-driven research and programmes with widespread community involvement. © 2015 International Society of Sport Psychology","global sport; life skills; positive youth development; South Africa; sport for development; sport-based youth development",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928654215

In the main experiment, 363 faculty members evaluated narrative summaries describing hypothetical female and male applicants for tenure-track assistant professorships who shared the same lifestyle (e.g., single without children, married with children). Applicants' profiles were systematically varied to disguise identically rated scholarship; profiles were counterbalanced by gender across faculty to enable between-faculty comparisons of hiring preferences for identically qualified women versus men. Results revealed a 2:1 preference for women by faculty of both genders across both math-intensive and non-math-intensive fields, with the single exception of male economists, who showed no gender preference. Results were replicated using weighted analyses to control for national sample characteristics. In follow-up experiments, 144 faculty evaluated competing applicants with differing lifestyles (e.g., divorced mother vs. married father), and 204 faculty compared same-gender candidates with children, but differing in whether they took 1-y-parental leaves in graduate school. Women preferred divorced mothers to married fathers; men preferred mothers who took leaves to mothers who did not. In two validation studies, 35 engineering faculty provided rankings using full curricula vitae instead of narratives, and 127 faculty rated one applicant rather than choosing fromamixed-gender group; the same preference for women was shown by faculty of both genders. These results suggest it is a propitious time for women launching careers in academic science. Messages to the contrary may discourage women from applying for STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) tenure-track assistant professorships. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

For the purpose of this paper we also allow consumption to cause environmental damage. Analysing the social context of consumption naturally lends itself to the use of game theoretic tools. We shall be concerned with two ways in which social interactions affect consumer preferences and behaviour: socially-embedded preferences, where the behaviour of other consumers affect an individual’s preferences and hence consumption (we consider two examples: conspicuous consumption and consumption norms) and socially-directed preferences where people display altruistic behaviour. Our aim is to show that building links between sociological and behavioural economic approaches to the study of consumer behaviour can lead to significant and surprising implications for conventional economic analysis and policy prescriptions, especially with respect to environmental policy. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Altruism; Competitive consumption; Consumer behaviour; Consumption norms; Environmental policy; Game theory; Kantian calculus; Moral behaviour; Social context",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928608288

Building upon the marketing, social psychology, and information system literature, this study empirically examines a set of functional determinants derived from the technology acceptance model and socio-psychological determinants drawn from the theory of reasoned action and social cognitive theory that may be responsible for the motivations of participants in online social networks. We propose a model by integrating functional, social, and psychological factors in predicting attitude and online social network usage. The survey outcomes from a cross-sectional study among 387 Facebook users in Malaysia support the hypothesised model. This study contributes by extending the cognitive learning theories in predicting online social networking usage. Particularly, this research presents a different perspective on online social networking by exploring the mediating effect of attitude and the moderating role of individual characteristics. This study demonstrates that desirable changes in the perception of functional benefits, self-efficacy, and need for cognition as well as perceptions of social pressure from significant others might lead to corresponding changes in attitude towards online social networking. Results of the study support the model efficacy and predictive ability of the proposed integrative model which may serve as a theoretical foundation for future researchers interested in examining other virtual community engagements such as blogging, online advertising, and online public relations activities. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","attitude; cognitive learning theories; need for cognition; online social network; self-efficacy; social influence; social networking behaviour",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928399859

Figures 5 and 8 were inadvertently printed in greyscale through a production related error. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-31350-001.) The Common Core set a standard for all children to read increasingly complex texts throughout schooling. The purpose of the present study was to explore text characteristics specifically in relation to early-grades text complexity. Three hundred fifty primary-grades texts were selected and digitized. Twenty-two text characteristics were identified at 4 linguistic levels, and multiple computerized operationalizations were created for each of the 22 text characteristics. A researcher-devised text-complexity outcome measure was based on teacher judgment of text complexity in the 350 texts as well as on student judgment of text complexity as gauged by their responses in a maze task for a subset of the 350 texts. Analyses were conducted using a logical analytical progression typically used in machine-learning research. Random forest regression was the primary statistical modeling technique. Nine text characteristics were most important for early-grades text complexity including word structure (decoding demand and number of syllables in words), word meaning (age of acquisition, abstractness, and word rareness), and sentence and discourse-level characteristics (intersentential complexity, phrase diversity, text density/information load, and noncompressibility). Notably, interplay among text characteristics was important to explanation of text complexity, particularly for subsets of texts.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-04976-001.) Objective: The number of individuals seeking refuge and safety in European and Western host-societies has increased in recent years, and there is no evidence to suggest that this trend will reverse in the foreseeable future. Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and youth are particularly vulnerable to risk. The detrimental influence of political conflicts, war, and forced migration on asylum-seeking individuals' mental health is well-documented; however, the stressors encountered after arrival to the host country have been investigated less frequently. This study explored how a group of 6 male refugees from Afghanistan experienced arriving to the Swedish host-society as unaccompanied minors, and how they perceived the support available to them. Method: Based on individual semistructured interviews, an interpretative phenomenological analysis was carried out to explore the perceived risks and protective factors during the first months and years in the host-society. Results: The qualitative findings draw attention to the crucial importance of clarifying the complex asylum-seeking process, the protective influence of social support, the importance of educational guidance, and participants' strong desire to fit in and move forward with their lives. Conclusion: The resulting information can inform the practice of supporting asylum-seeking youths' adaptation in host-societies and in developing assessment measures and interventions for these groups. Specifically, the results indicate the protective role of social support and highlight the potential value of mentoring schemes.

Thus, we sought to further explore the embodied and disordered eating experiences of male distance runners through the use of visual narrative methods (i.e. drawing or constructing a visual story/collage), allowing participants to creatively express their storied relationship with running, their bodies and food. Participants included four competitive male distance runners. A visual thematic and dialogic/performance analysis was performed on all four visual narratives. All of the runners drew upon dominant cultural images, messages and texts to create their visual narratives. Within the visual stories, two emerging narratives, a transformative narrative and a rollercoaster narrative, were identified. These narratives were woven together with a performance narrative and gendered meanings around the body, food and exercise to frame the runners’ embodied and disordered eating experiences. This study extends previous literature on the performance narrative and the construction of meaning around the body, food and exercise for male athletes. Practical implications include the need to provide male athletes with narratives outside of those (re)produced through the sport-exercise-media complex, allowing for more diverse meaning-making processes and leading to more positive embodied experiences. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","body; distance running; food; gender; men; narratives; visual methods",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928593789

An online survey was sent to students, academic faculty, and practitioners from the disciplines of social work and psychology throughout Australia, addressing issues related to work with older adults. Thematic analysis was used to extract themes and subthemes from the responses (N = 252). The most important finding was that a barrier to working with older adults appears to be a consequence of a perpetuating cycle among students, academic faculty, and professionals collectively. Faculty members did not feel knowledgeable in the area of gerontology and were therefore not able to educate students in this area appropriately, leading to students to enter the workforce as either faculty members and/or practitioners without expertise to work with older adults. This study highlighted the importance of including more comprehensive gerontological information within social sciences’ curriculum, which may promote more realistic images of older adults and help alleviate barriers to working with this population. © 2015, Routledge.

Data used in this study are taken from surveys among students, college teachers and placement supervisors. The results of this study do not corroborate with the notion of clashing epistemological beliefs between the educational field and the field of practice. However, the results do indicate that the way theories are taught and how students study may influence student views of the importance of theoretical knowledge for professional practice. The general teacher-training programme, more than the other programmes, faces challenges in linking theory to practice. The nursing programme also encounters difficulties in college teachers being able to relate some of the nursing-specific theories to practice in the classroom setting. Moreover, the findings imply that not only programme coherence, but also students' study efforts might be essential aspects in explaining why some students do not perceive theoretical knowledge as important for professional practice. © 2015 The Editors of Nordic Psychology","coherence; epistemological beliefs; profession; professional knowledge",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928397280

The effect of lithium on osteogenesis or on the human fracture risk has been widely reported. However, little is known on its role in distraction osteogenesis to date. In this study, the effect of systematic administrated lithium on distraction osteogenesis in a rat model was investigated. The osteotomy was performed on the right tibia in 40 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Then they were randomly assigned into two equal groups (n = 20/group), which underwent Lithium or saline treatment through gastric gavage until the day they were killed. One week after the osteotomy, the tibias were distracted for 14 days (rate 0.6 mm/day). Following 8 weeks consolidation period, the distracted tibias in both groups were harvested and examined by X-ray plain radiography, histology, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, Micro-CT, and biomechanical tests. The results showed that lithium group possessed higher bone mineral density, more mature new bone tissue, and better regenerated bone mass continuity in the distraction gaps without any local or systemic adverse effects was encountered. This study suggested lithium could increase bony callus ossification volume and accelerate distracted tissue mineralization to facilitate bone regeneration in distraction gap. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Bone regeneration; Distraction osteogenesis; Limb lengthening; Lithium",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928333574

Consequently, this study was designed to use the interpretative phenomenological analysis approach to explore the motivators and practices of three older active males who independently initiated regular PA participation during middle age. Participants discussed the role of mentors and other influences, and their awareness of effort or intensity during activity. Data analysis suggested that these men assertively managed their environments and used internal restraints in order to regulate their PA participation, consistent with some elements of Bandura's social cognitive theory.

The aim of the present study was to verify the role of multicomponent therapy in controlling the MetS, inflammation and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in obese adolescents. The second aim was to investigate the relationships between adipokines, the MetS parameters and cIMT. A total of sixty-nine obese adolescents participated in the present study and completed 1 year of multicomponent therapy (a combination of strategies involving nutrition, psychology, physical exercise and clinical therapy), and were divided according to their MetS diagnosis as follows: MetS (n 19); non-MetS (n 50). Blood analyses of glucose, lipid and adipokine concentrations (adiponectin, leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and C-reactive protein) were collected. Insulin resistance was assessed using the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and homeostasis model assessment-adiponectin. cIMT and visceral and subcutaneous fat were estimated using ultrasonography. At baseline, the MetS group presented higher waist circumference, glucose and insulin levels, and systolic and median blood pressures compared with the non-MetS group. After therapy, both groups showed improvements in the anthropometric profile, body composition, insulin level, insulin resistance, insulin sensibility, TAG and VLDL-cholesterol, adiponectin, leptin and PAI-1 levels, blood pressure and cIMT. The prevalence of the MetS was reduced from 27·5 to 13·0 %. Metabolic syndrome patients showed resistance in the attenuation of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and leptin:adiponectin and adiponectin:leptin ratios. In the MetS group, the variation in the adiponectin:leptin ratio was correlated with variations in glucose, insulin sensibility, total cholesterol, LDL-c and systolic blood pressure. Additionally, the number of MetS parameters was correlated with the carotid measurement. Moreover, the variation in cIMT was correlated with the variations in insulin sensibility, total cholesterol and LDL-c. For the entire group, the number of MetS alterations was correlated with the leptin level and leptin:adiponectin ratio and adiponectin:leptin ratio after therapy. In conclusion, multicomponent therapy was effective in controlling the MetS, inflammation and cIMT in the obese adolescents. However, the MetS patients showed resistance in the attenuation of the atherogenic lipid profile and leptin:adiponectin ratio and adiponectin:leptin ratio. These results suggest that the MetS patients have increased cardiovascular risks, and that it is important to attempt to control the inflammatory process that occurs due to obesity in clinical practice in order to improve the health of adolescents.

Background: A group of international researchers, clinicians and service users met in 2006 to establish the state of clinical and academic knowledge relating to PTSD FC. A paper identified four key areas of research knowledge at that time. Methods: Fourteen clinicians and researchers met in Oxford, UK to update the previously published paper relating to PTSD FC. The first part of the meeting focused on updating the four key areas identified previously, and the second part on discussing new and emerging areas of research within the field. Results: A number of advances have been made in research within the area of PTSD FC. Prevalence is well established within mothers, several intervention studies have been published, and there is growing interest in new areas: staff and pathways; prevention and early intervention; impact on families and children; special populations; and post-traumatic growth. Conclusion: Despite progress, significant gaps remain within the PTSD FC knowledge base. Further research continues to be needed across all areas identified in 2006, and five areas were identified which can be seen as ‘new and emerging’. All of these new areas require further extensive research. Relatively little is still known about PTSD FC. © 2015 Society for Reproductive and Infant Psychology","childbirth; PTSD; research; review; theory",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928670931

Research design and methods: Cross-sectional analyses at study baseline were conducted with a national Latino cohort (n = 1,388) that included Mexican Americans, Dominican Americans, Puerto Rican Americans and Central/South Americans. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were conducted to test the effects of psychosocial variables (chronic stress, depressive symptoms, and social support) on MetS. In addition, separate subgroup-specific models, controlling for nationality, age, gender, socioeconomic position, language spoken at home, exercise, smoking and drinking status, and testing for the effects of chronic stress, depressive symptoms and inflammation (IL-6, CRP, fibrinogen) in predicting risk for MetS were conducted. Results: In the overall sample, high chronic stress independently predicted risk for MetS, however this association was found to be significant only in Mexican Americans and Puerto Rican Americans. Social support did not moderate the associations between chronic stress and MetS for any group. Chronic stress was not associated with inflammatory markers in either the overall sample or in each group. Conclusions: Our results suggest a differential contribution of chronic stress to the prevalence of MetS by national groups. © 2015 Ortiz et al.",,"Ford, E.S., Li, C., Zhao, G., Prevalence and correlates of metabolic syndrome based on a harmonious definition among adults in the US (2010) J Diabetes, 2, pp. 180-193. , PMID: 20923483; CDC, Prevalence of diabetes among Hispanics - Selected Areas, 1998-2002 (2004) Morbidity and Mortality.

Governmental policy makers can apply established tools from the governmental toolbox to this end (e.g., laws, regulations, incentives, and disincentives). Alternatively, they can employ new tools that capitalize on the wealth of knowledge about human behavior and behavior change that has been accumulated in the behavioral sciences (e.g., psychology and economics). Two contrasting approaches to behavior change are nudge policies and boost policies. These policies rest on fundamentally different research programs on bounded rationality, namely, the heuristics and biases program and the simple heuristics program, respectively. This article examines the policy–theory coherence of each approach. To this end, it identifies the necessary assumptions underlying each policy and analyzes to what extent these assumptions are implied by the theoretical commitments of the respective research program. Two key results of this analysis are that the two policy approaches rest on diverging assumptions and that both suffer from disconnects with the respective theoretical program, but to different degrees: Nudging appears to be more adversely affected than boosting does. The article concludes with a discussion of the limits of the chosen evaluative dimension, policy–theory coherence, and reviews some other benchmarks on which policy programs can be assessed. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Bounded rationality; Defaults; Ecological rationality; Heuristics-and-biases program; Nudging; Simple heuristics program",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928326618

Second, the purpose was to examine psychological factors that enable an ultra-distance runner during an event. A case study report from a 49-year-old female ultra-distance runner, running a 3641 kilometre adventure event during a 10-week period was made. Data were collected during 15 weeks with three self-report questionnaires – more specifically, an initial report 3 weeks prior to the run, a weekly report during the 10 weeks of running, and, finally, a report 2 weeks after the run. In addition, a follow-up narrative interview was performed nine months after the run was completed. The main result showed that perceived exertion level had a statistically significant negative relationship with negative mood and a positive statistically significant relationship with positive mood. Results also showed a statistically significant difference between the three measurement points based on the variable perceived exertion level. In addition, the runner's narration suggested four main categories of psychologically assisting attributes: motivation, group cohesiveness, self-awareness, and mental stamina. The findings highlight the complex balance between extreme physical load and feelings of comfort and elevated mood. Another finding is that the joint effect of different psychological factors – especially the runner's high self-awareness, strong-minded attitude, and ability to use humour in problematic situations – was helpful during the run.

Seventy-two pupils in curriculum year 5 were asked to produce two drawings of themselves in school (144 drawings), one in a ‘happy’ situation and one in an ‘unhappy’ situation. They were encouraged to add titles and speech bubbles. The drawings were thematically analysed using a phenomenological framework, which explored the affective, behavioural and cognitive elements of each drawing. The initial emerging themes were the location of the drawing, the school setting, the activity occurring and the people present. Further analysis explored the ‘unhappy’ drawings, with the emerging subthemes of Learning (being tested, not knowing what to do and comparing self to peers) and Social Interaction (friendships and conflict). The most noticeable conclusions were the impact of peer relationships (96 drawings included peers), the relatively few teachers and other adults included (only in 22 pictures) and the evidence of a wide variety of negative learning and social interactions. The study also provided evidence that asking children to draw pictures of themselves in school at this age was an effective way of accessing their views about a range of experiences and situations in school. © 2015 NAPCE","children’s drawings; children’s views; Personal Construct Psychology; research",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928252763

However, the roles of the objects frequently differ for the rows and the columns. For example, in a visual alphabetic confusion matrix from an experimental psychology study, both the rows and columns pertain to letters of the alphabet. Yet the rows correspond to the presented stimulus letter, whereas the columns refer to the letter provided as the response. Other examples abound in psychology, including applications related to interpersonal interactions (friendship, trust, information sharing) in social and developmental psychology, brand switching in consumer psychology, journal citation analysis in any discipline (including quantitative psychology), and free association tasks in any subarea of psychology. When seeking to establish a partition of the objects in such applications, it is overly restrictive to require the partitions of the row and column objects to be identical, or even the numbers of clusters for the row and column objects to be the same. This suggests the need for a biclustering approach that simultaneously establishes separate partitions of the row and column objects.

In psychological research, reward processing has typically been studied in relation to behavioral outcomes. In contrast, neuroscientists have been examining how rewards are processed by brain structures that are related to the reward circuitry, and in a few instances have also evaluated behavioral outcomes. In this article, I first present findings from both the social and educational psychology and neuroscientific research on reward processing that have frequently been reported without acknowledgment of the presence of the other. Subsequently, five topics pointing to the need for integration of research findings across these two fields are considered. These include the following: (a) distinctions between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, (b) causes of undermining effects of rewards, (c) potential benefits of choice provided for individuals, (d) differences in reward types, and (e) individual differences in reward processing. It is argued that, if positive aspects of rewards are to be utilized and their potentially negative effects are to be avoided, neuroscientific, social, and educational research findings need to be integrated. This paper provides a first step toward such integration. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Brain activation; Learning; Motivation; Neuroscience; Reward circuitry; Rewards",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928128803

We become attached to our careers, to our homes, to certain ideas, and perhaps most importantly, to other people. Interestingly, despite its import and ubiquity in our everyday lives, the topic of attachment per se has been largely ignored in the philosophy literature. I address this lacuna by identifying (a type of) attachment as a rich “mode of mattering” that can help to inform certain aspects of agency and emotion. First, drawing on insights from Ancient stoicism and developmental and clinical psychology, I suggest that the relevant form of attachment involves a felt need for its object and a particular relationship between the object and the attached agent’s sense of security. I then argue that these features serve to distinguish the attitude from the more philosophically familiar notion of caring. Finally, I show that recognizing this form of attachment as a distinct mode of mattering has important implications for understanding grief. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Attachment; Caring; Emotion; Grief; Security; Well-being",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928142993

We analyzed the interview data obtained from 17 clinical psychologists using grounded theory approach. Two major category groups were generated: Developing as a Clinician and Difficulties. The primary positive learning experiences in Developing as a Clinician were labeled “Hot Learning,” in which trainees acquired professional knowledge and skills through close interpersonal engagement with clients, peers, faculty, and supervisors. In contrast, Difficulties involved trainees’ negative experiences resulting in feelings of self-doubt and incompetence. These experiences occurred in close but sometimes conflicted interpersonal contexts, where trainees felt evaluated in a manner incommensurate with the support they received.

Despite this, forgiveness literature from the rational-emotive behavior therapy (REBT) perspective has been rare. This is unfortunate, given the elegance of the REBT model and that Ellis touched favorably upon forgiving as far back as 1961. The REBT model is dialogued with the works of Enright and Fitzgibbons (Helping clients forgive. American Psychological Association, Washington, 2000; Forgiveness therapy. American Psychological Association, Washington, 2015) with reference to others. Among recommendations are: (1) using and researching REBT regarding forgiveness; (2) focusing on unforgiveness-reduction when clients cannot contemplate forgiving; (3) recognizing an “Acceptance continuum” of healthy responses from “non-forgiving” to “forgiving”; (4) considering use of REBT with combined unforgiveness and trauma, as well as exploring parallels between the two phenomena; (5) giving primacy to “Unconditional Self Acceptance (followed by Unconditional Life and Other Acceptance); and (6) complementing forgiveness outcomes studies with phenomenological research.

To date, this topic has garnered relatively little research attention even though work is often identified as a central aspect of men’s identity. Although millions of men perform “women’s work” in a broad range of fields, the extant database around the world focuses primarily on male nurses and teachers and tends to focus on ways to recruit and retain men in these professions. We argue that studying men in female-dominated vocations is important because it furthers our understanding of the workplace in general, as well as the ways in which men experience, understand, and navigate challenges to their masculinity. Moreover, expanding our knowledge of men in female-dominated vocations has important theoretical implications for theories addressing gender-based equality and power dynamics, the psychology of men and masculinity, and intersecting identities (or intersectionality). After a brief overview of the literature and establishing this rationale, we introduce the articles in the special issue.

It is also assumed that the mate’s value is a central factor in determining an individual’s sexual strategy. Thus, the current study was developed to investigate whether intra-sex variation exists in the ideal romantic preferences of both genders and whether these preferences are associated with self-perception. To investigate these questions, cluster analyses were performed on the descriptions of ideal mates for short- and long-term relationships given by 366 Brazilian undergraduates (145 men and 221 women). Subsequently, comparisons were made between the lists of self-perceived attributes related to reproduction generated by the resulting groups. The results suggest that males and females use different mating tactics for short-term mating and that males use different tactics for long-term mating. Among men, the mating tactics observed seem to be related to male mate value and their tactics changed when they described ideal short- and long-term partners. Women’s results showed different preference patterns in short-term assessments but minor differences were observed between them in terms of female mate value. For long-term relationships, female patterns were less distinct, indicating a single preference pattern. These findings indicate that a number of different tactics may be clustered together in investigations that address ideal preferences, and that studies of mate preferences must consider individual self-perceptions. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Evolutionary psychology; Human mate selection; Human sex differences; Self-perception; Sexual selection",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928136812
