At most stations, the orientation of the faster polarized shear wave is parallel to the axes of the maximum horizontal compressional strain rate and stress, indicating that stress-induced anisotropy is dominant in the analyzed region. Furthermore, near the source faults, the orientation of the faster polarized shear wave is oblique to the strike of the source faults. This suggests that microcracks parallel to the strike of the source fault, which would be produced by the fault movement of the Nobi earthquake, have healed with the healing of the faults. For stress-induced anisotropy, time delays normalized by path length in the anisotropic upper crust as a function of the differential strain rate are coincident with those in the inland high strain rate zone, Japan. These data, together with those of a previous study, show that the variation in the stressing rate, estimated from shear wave splitting, is close to that estimated from geodetic observation. This implies that the variation in the stressing rate in the brittle upper crust is linked to that in the strain rate on the ground surface. © 2015 Hiramatsu et al.; licensee Springer.","Brittle-ductile transition zone; High strain rate zone; Inland earthquake; Seismic anisotropy; Shear wave splitting; Stressing rate","Ando, M., The stress field of the Japanese Islands in the last 0.5 million years (1979) Earth Mon Symp, 7, pp. 541-546. , in Japanese; Booth, D.C., Crampin, S., Shear-wave polarizations on a curved wavefront at an isotropic free surface (1985) Geophys J Roy Astron Soc, 83, pp. 31-45; Hiramatsu, Y., Honma, H., Saiga, A., Furumoto, M., Ooida, T., Seismological evidence on characteristic time of crack healing in the shallow crust (2005) Geophys Res Lett, 32, p.

However, previous studies have revealed that the metadata describing these data can possibly be contaminated by instrumentation response errors that are often difficult to recognize from visual waveform checks. Herein, we report on the development of a systematic method of assessing seismometer conditions when recording ground motions at a period range of 50 to 200 s in observation networks whose station intervals are smaller than 200 km. Findings: The method is based on comparisons between teleseismic surface wave records at a target station and those at multiple surrounding reference stations, from which we calculate three index parameters and evaluate in situ instrumentation conditions, including amplitude and phase responses against input ground motions. In our experiments, we applied the proposed method to F-net broadband seismometers covering the Japanese Islands, where station intervals are approximately 100 km. This allows us, through calculations of the index parameters, to evaluate instrumentation health at each station at least once every 60 days. Using our proposed method, we found that approximately 75% of the evaluated index parameters distributed well around the standard values, and for most examined broadband seismometers, response anomalies are not detected at the period range of 50 to 200 s. However, instrumentation errors, such as gain decrease over the evaluated periods and gradual changes in amplitude and phase frequency responses (sometimes covering several years) were identified at a few stations. Additionally, overdamping errors at the STS-1 seismometers, which experience significant amplitude and phase frequency response variations around the 360-s corner, appear to have been common at several stations. In contrast, STS-2 seismometers appear to have functioned more reliably than STS-1 seismometers. Conclusions: We developed a method to evaluate broadband seismometer instrument conditions by comparing teleseismic surface waves observed at a target station with those at multiple surrounding stations. It is believed that the systematic evaluation of instrumentation health using our method will enhance the operation of seismic networks, and allow researchers to eliminate contaminated data before conducting various data analyses. © 2015 Kimura et al.; licensee Springer.","Amplitude frequency response; Broadband seismometer; Phase frequency response; Seismic instrumentation health; Teleseismic surface wave","Davis, P., Berger, J., Calibration of the global seismographic network using tides (2007) Seismol Res Lett, 78 (4), pp. 454-459; Davis, P., Ishii, M., Masters, G., An assessment of the accuracy of GSN sensor response information (2005) Seismol Res Lett, 76 (6), pp. 678-683; Dziewonski, A.M., Chou, T.-A., Woodhouse, J.H., Determination of earthquake source parameters from waveform data for studies of global and regional seismicity (1981) J Geophys Res, 86, pp. 2825-2852; Efron, B., Bootstrap methods: Another look at the jackknife (1979) Ann Stat, 7, pp. 1-126; Ekström, G., Dalton, C.A., Nettles, M., Observations of time-dependent errors in long-period instrument gain at global seismic stations (2006) Seismol Res Lett, 77 (1), pp. 12-22; Ekström, G., Nettles, M., Dziewonski, A.M., The global CMT project 2004-2010: Centroid-moment tensors for 13,017 earthquakes (2012) Phys Earth Planet Inter, 200-201, pp. 1-9; Forsyth, D.W., Li, A., Seismic array analysis of two-dimensional variations in surface wave phase velocity and azimuthal anisotropy in the presence of multipathing interference (2005) Seismic Earth: Array Analysis of Broadband Seismograms Geophysical Monograph Series, 157, pp. 81-97; Fukuyama, E., Ishida, M., Hori, S., Sekiguchi, S., Watada, S., Broadband seismic observation conducted under the FREE SIA project (1996) Rep Nat'l Res Inst Earth Sci Disas Prev, 57, pp. 23-31. , in Japanese with English abstract; Fukuyama, E., Ishida, M., Dreger, D.S., Kawai, H., Automated seismic moment tensor determination by using on-line broadband seismic waveforms (1998) Zisin, 51, pp. 149-156. , in Japanese with English abstract; Hutt, C.R., Ringler, A.T., Some possible causes of and corrections for STS-1 response changes in the global seismographic network (2011) Seismol Res Lett, 82 (4), pp. 560-571; Ito, Y., Obara, K., Shiomi, K., Sekine, S., Hirose, H., Slow earthquakes coincident with episodic tremors and slow slip events (2007) Science, 310, pp. 503-506; Matsumoto, T., Hori, S., Matsubayashi, H., Broadband seismic observation - NIED F-net (2009) Zisin, 61, pp. 9-S18. , in Japanese with English abstract; Matsumura, M., Ito, Y., Kimura, H., Obara, K., Sekiguchi, S., Hori, S., Kasahara, K., Development of accurate and quick analysis system for source parameters (AQUA) (2006) Zisin, 59, pp. 167-184. , in Japanese with English abstract; Okada, Y., Kasahara, K., Hori, S., Obara, K., Sekiguchi, S., Fujiwara, H., Yamamoto, A., Recent progress of seismic observation networks in Japan - Hi-net, F-net, K-NET and KiK-net (2004) Earth Planets Space, 56, pp. xv-xxviii; Ringler, A.T., Gee, L.S., Hutt, C.R., McNamara, D.E., Temporal variations in global seismic station ambient noise power levels (2010) Seismol Res Lett, 81 (4), pp. 605-613; Ringler, A.T., Gee, L.S., Marshall, B., Hutt, C.R., Storm, T., Data quality of seismic records from the Tohoku, Japan, earthquake as recorded across the Albuquerque seismological laboratory networks (2012) Seismol Res Lett, 83 (3), pp. 575-584; Tanimoto, T., Rivera, L., The ZH ratio method for long-period seismic data: Sensitivity kernels and observational techniques (2008) Geophys J Int, 172 (1), pp. 187-198; Vidale, J.E., Complex polarization analysis of particle motion (1986) Bssa, 76 (5), pp. 1393-1405; Wessel, P., Smith, W.H.F., New, improved version of the Generic Mapping Tools released, EOS Trans (1998) AGU, 79, p. 579; Yamada, I., A problem in long-term stability of STS-1 seismometer (2001) Zisin, 53, pp. 259-262. , in Japanese; Yoshizawa, K., Miyake, K., Yomogida, K., 3-D upper mantle structure beneath Japan and its surrounding region from inter-station dispersion measurements of surface waves (2010) Phys Earth Planet Inter, 183, pp. 4-19; Yuki, Y., Ishihara, Y., Methods for maintaining the performance of STS-1 seismometer (2002) Front Res Earth Evolution, 2, pp. 1-5",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929161518

To this aim it is proposed for the first time to exploit the structure-soil-structure mechanism to develop a device, hosted in the soil but detached from the structure, able to absorb part of the seismic energy so to reduce the vibration of neighbourhood structures. The design of the device is herein addressed to protect monopile structures from earthquake induced ground motion. By modelling the ground motion as zero-mean quasi-stationary response-spectrum-compatible Gaussian stochastic process, the soil as visco-elastic medium and the target monopiled-structure as a linear behaving structure the device, herein called Vibrating Barrier (ViBa), has been designed through an optimization procedure. Various numerical and experimental results are produced to show the effectiveness of the ViBa. Remarkably, a significant reduction of the structural response up to 44% has been achieved. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Ground motion excitation; Piled-structures; Structure-soil-structure-interaction; Vibrating barrier; Vibration control","Woods, R.D., Screening of surface waves in soils (1968) J Soil Mech Found Eng Div ASCE, 94 (4), pp. 951-979; Warburton, G.B., Richardson, J.D., Webster, J.J., Forced vibrations of two masses on an elastic half space (1971) J Appl Mech, 38 (1), p. 148; Luco, J.E., Contesse, L., Dynamic structure-soil-structure interaction (1973) Bull Seismol Soc Am, 63 (4), pp. 1289-1303; Kobori, T., Kusakabe, K., Cross-interaction between two embedded structures in earthquakes (1980) Proceedings of the seventh world conference on earth-quake engineering, pp. 65-72. , Istanbul (Turkey); Mulliken, J.S., Karabalis, D.L., Discrete model for dynamic through-the-soil coupling of 3-D foundations and structures (1998) Earthq Eng Struct Dyn, 27 (7), pp. 687-710; Naserkhaki, S., Pourmohammad, H., SSI and SSSI effects in seismic analysis of twin buildings: discrete model concept (2012) J Civ Eng Manag, 18 (6), pp. 890-898; Menglin, L., Huaifeng, W., Xi, C., Yongmei, Z., Structure-soil-structure interaction: literature review (2011) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 31, pp. 1724-1731; Clouteau, D., Aubry, D., Modifications of the ground motion in dense urban areas (2001) J Comput Acoust, 9, pp. 1659-1675; Chávez-García, F.J., Cárdenas-Soto, M., The contribution of the built environment to the free-field ground motion in Mexico city (2002) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 22, pp. 773-780; Kham, M., Semblat, J.-F., Bard, P.-Y., Dangla, P., Seismic site-city interaction: main governing phenomena through simplified numerical models (2006) Bull Seismol Soc Am, 96 (5), pp. 1934-1951; Guéguen, P., Bard, P.-Y., Chavez-Garcia, F.J., Site-city interaction in Mexico city-like environments: an analytical study (2002) Bull Seismol Soc Am, 92 (2), pp. 794-811; Boutin, C., Roussillon, P., Assessment of the urbanization effect on seismic response (2004) Bull Seismol Soc Am, 94 (1), pp. 251-268; Behnamfar, F., Sugimura, Y., Dynamic response of adjacent structures under spatially variable seismic waves (1999) Probab Eng Mech, 14, pp. 33-44; Alexander, N.A., Ibraim, E., Aldaikh, H., A simple discrete model for interaction of adjacent buildings during earthquakes (2013), 124, pp. 1-10. , Computers & Structures.

In more recent years, attempts to assess the liquefaction potential have also been made through measurement of shear wave velocity (V<inf>S</inf>) in boreholes or from the surface. The latter approach has the advantage of being non-invasive and low cost and of surveying lines rather than single points. However, the resolution of seismic surface techniques is lower than that of borehole techniques and it is still debated whether it is sufficient to assess the liquefaction potential. In this paper we focus our attention on surface seismic techniques (specifically the popular passive and active seismic techniques based on the correlation of surface waves such as ReMiTM, MASW, ESAC, SSAP, etc.) and explore their performance in assessing the liquefaction susceptibility of soils. The experimental dataset is provided by the two main seismic events of M<inf>L</inf>=5.9 and 5.8 (M<inf>W</inf>=6.1, M<inf>W</inf>=6.0) that struck the Emilia-Romagna region (Northern Italy) on May 20 and 29, 2012, after which extensive liquefaction phenomena were documented in an area of 1200km2.The CPT and drillings available in the area allow us to classify the soils into four classes: A) shallow liquefied sandy soils, B) shallow non-liquefied sandy soils, C) deep non-liquefied sandy soils, and D) clayey-silty soils, and to determine that on average class A soils presented a higher sand content at the depth of 5-8m compared to class B soils, where sand was dominant in the upper 5m. Surface wave active-passive surveys were performed at 84 sites, and it was found that they were capable of discriminating among only three soil classes, since class A and B soils showed exactly the same V<inf>S</inf> distribution, and it is possible to show both experimentally and theoretically that they appear not to have sufficient resolution to address the seismic liquefaction issue. As a last step, we applied the state-of-the art CSR-V<inf>S</inf> method to assess the liquefaction potential of sandy deposits and we found that it failed in the studied area. This might be due to the insufficient resolution of the surface wave methods in assessing the Vs of thin layers and to the fact that Vs scales with the square root of the shear modulus, which implies an intrinsic lower sensitivity of Vs to the shear resistance of the soil compared to parameters traditionally measured with the penetration tests. However, it also emerged that the pure observation of the surface wave dispersion curves at their simplest level (i.e. in the frequency domain, with no inversion) is still potentially informative and can be used to identify the sites where more detailed surveys to assess the liquefaction potential are recommended.",,"Bertolini, G., Fioroni, C., Aerial inventory of surficial geological effects induces by the recent Emilia earthquake (Italy): preliminary report (2012) Ann Geophys, 55, pp. 705-711; Castellaro, S., Mulargia, F., Vs30 estimates using constrained H/V measurements (2009) Bull Seismol Soc Am, 99, pp. 761-773; Castellaro, S., Mulargia, F., The effect of velocity inversions on H/V (2009) Pure Appl Geophys, 166, pp. 567-592; Castellaro, S., Mulargia, F., Simplified seismic soil classification: the VfZ matrix (2014) Bull Earthq Eng, 12, pp. 735-754; Cubrinovski, M., Bradley, B., Wotherspoon, L., Green, R., Bray, J., Wood, C., Geotechnical aspects of the 22 February 2011 christchurch earthquake (2011) Bull N Z Soc Earthq Eng, 44, pp. 205-226; Di Manna, P., Guerrieri, L., Piccardi, L., Vittori, E., Castaldini, D., Berlusconi, A., Ground effects induced by the 2012 seismic sequence in Emilia: implications for seismic hazard assessment in the Po Plain (2012) Ann Geophys, 55, pp. 697-703; Liquefaction phenomena associated with the Emilia earthquake sequence of May-June 2012 (Northern Italy) (2013) Nat Hazards, 13, pp. 1-13; Green, R.A., Wood, C., Cox, B., Cubrinovski, M., Wotherspoon, L., Bradley, B., Use of DPC and SASW tests to evaluate liquefaction potential: predictions vs. observations during the recent New Zealand earthquakes (2011) Seismol Res Lett, 82, pp. 927-938; Gucunski, N., Woods, R.D., Numerical simulation of the SASW test (1992) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 11, pp. 213-227; Idriss, I.M., Boulanger, R.W., (2008) Soil liquefaction during earthquakes, p. 261. , Monograph MNO-12, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, Oakland, CA; Iwasaki, T., Tokida, K., Tatsuoka, F., Watanabe, S., Yasuda, S., Sato, H., Microzonation for soil liquefaction potential using simplified methods (1982) Proceedings of the 3rd international earthquake microzonation conference.

The current study constitutes the second part of an experimental investigation carried out for (i) evaluating the seismic response of RC wide and shallow beam-narrow column joints when designed and detailed under gravity load; and (ii) for exploring the potential of improving the seismic performance of the same joints without introducing significant changes in the design and construction practices. The first part of the investigation concentrated on exterior joints, the results of which were reported elsewhere (Elsouri, 2013). This study concentrates on interior joints, in which four full-scale beam-column sub-assemblages were tested under quasi-static cyclic loading. Two of the joints, referred to as ""as-built"", were designed and detailed for gravity load in accordance with local design and construction practices. The other two joints, referred to as ""earthquake-resistant"", were also designed assuming gravity load but their reinforcement detailing were improved to satisfy part of the ACI 318-08 requirements and ACI-ASCE 352-02 recommendations for seismic-resistant structures. The as-built joints experienced shear failure within the joint core at early lateral drift. With a slight improvement of the reinforcement detailing, despite violating the limits of joint dimensions and some detailing requirements of ACI 318-08, the earthquake-resistant joints acquired considerably improved seismic performance by preventing or delaying joint shear failure; and by developing higher lateral load, deformation, and energy dissipation capacities when compared with the as-built joints. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Concrete; Connection; Cyclic; Earthquake; Joint; Reinforced; Seismic","Building code requirements for reinforced concrete and commentary (2008) ACI 318-2008/ACI 318R-08., , Farmington Hills, MI: American Concrete Institute;; Recommendation for design of beam-column connections in monolithic reinforced concrete structures (2010) ACI 352R-02., , Detroit, MI: American Concrete Institute; Reapproved; Benavent-Climent, A., Cahís, X., Vico, J.M., Interior wide beam-column connections in existing RC frames subjected to lateral earthquake loading (2010) Bull Earthquake Eng, 8, pp. 401-420; Benavent-Climent, A., Seismic behavior of RC wide beam-column connections under dynamic loading (2007) J Earthquake Eng, 11, pp. 493-511; Benavent-Climent, A., Cahís, X., Zahran, R., Exterior wide beam-column connections in existing RC frames subjected to lateral earthquake loads (2009) J Eng Struct, 31 (7), pp. 1414-1424; Chow, H.-L., Selna, L.G., Seismic response of shallow-floor buildings.

The limitations are mainly related to the beam-to-column connections as the main load transfer paths. Two distinct exterior beam-column connections made of normal-strength concrete are investigated experimentally. Both dry and wet type installment techniques are used in the industrial type joints while the residential type joints are wet connections. The specimens are subjected cyclic displacement reversals in order to obtain information on strength, stiffness and ductility characteristics of the connection details. The preliminary design of the joints has been updated during the tests based on the damages observed, thus a set of improved specimens have also been built and tested, and a relatively better performance is obtained expectedly. The industrial and residential types of connections showed stable load-displacement cycles with high energy dissipation up to structural drift of 2%, though a significant level of pinching and deterioration of the critical section have occurred at around 3% drift level. The tested specimens have been numerically modeled to calibrate the analytical tools, and a satisfactory approximation has been obtained between experimental and numerical results. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Beam-column connection; Cyclic behavior of connection; Exterior connection; Joint; Precast construction","Park, R., A perspective on the seismic design of precast concrete structures in New Zealand (1995) PCI J, 1995, pp. 40-50. , [May-June]; Structural connections for precast concrete buildings (2008) Bulletin, 43; Bhatt, P., Kirk, D.W., Test on an improved beam column connection for precast concrete (1985) ACI J, 82 (6), pp. 834-843; Seckin, M., Fu, H.C., Beam-column connections in precast reinforced concrete constructions (1990) ACI Struct J, 87 (3), pp. 252-261; French, C.W., Amu, O., Tarzikhan, C., Connections between precast elements-failure outside connection region (1989) J Struct Eng, 115 (2), pp. 316-340; French, C.W., Hafner, M., Jayashankar, V., Connection between precast elements-failure within connection region (1989) J Struct Eng, 115 (12), pp. 3171-3192; Ersoy, U., Tankut, T., Precast concrete members with welded plate connections under reversed cyclic loading (1993) PCI J, 38 (4), pp. 94-100; Priestley, M.J.N., Tao, J., Seismic response of precast prestressed concrete frames with partially debonded tendons (1993) PCI J, 38 (1), pp. 58-69; Nakaki, S.D., Englekirk, R.E., Plaehn, J.L., Ductile connectors for a precast concrete frame (1994) PCI J, 39 (5), pp. 46-59; Priestley, M.J.N., The PRESSS program - current status and proposed plans for phase III (1996) PCI J, 41 (2), pp. 22-40; Nakaki, S.W., Standon, J., Sritharan, S., An overview of the PRESSS five story precast test building (1999) PCI J, 44 (2), pp. 26-39; Korkmaz, H.H., Tankut, T., Performance of a precast concrete beam to beam connection subject to reversed cycling load (2005) Eng Struct, 27, pp. 1392-1407; Ertas, O., Ozden, S., Ozturan, T., Ductile connections in precast concrete moment resisting frames (2006) PCI J, pp. 2-12. , [May-June]; Kaya, M., Arslan, A.S., Analytical modeling of post-tensioned precast beam-to-column connections (2009) Mater Des, 30, pp. 3802-3811; Parastesh, H., Hajirasouliha, I., Ramezani, R., A new ductile moment-resisting connection for precast concrete frames in seismic regions: an experimental investigation (2014) Eng Struct, 70, pp. 144-157; Negro, P., Bournas, D., Molina, F.J., Pseudodynamic tests on a full-scale 3-storey precast concrete building: global response (2013) Eng Struct, 57, pp. 596-608; Bournas, D., Negro, P., Molina, F.J., Pseudodynamic tests on a full-scale 3-storey precast concrete building: behavior of the mechanical connections and floor diaphragms (2013) Eng Struct, 57, pp. 609-627; Noor, F.A., Boswell, L.F., (1992) Small scale modeling of concrete structures, , Elsevier Science Publisher Ltd; Karadogan, F., Yuksel, E., Bal, I.E., (2012) The seismic behavior of an asymmetric exterior precast beam-column connection, , 15WCEE, Lisboa, Portugal; Yuksel, E., Surmeli, M., Quasi-static cyclic displacement pattern for seismic evaluation of reinforced concrete columns (2011) Struct Eng Mech, 37 (3), pp. 267-283; (2007), Interim testing protocols for determining the seismic performance characteristics of structural and nonstructural components(2011) Open system for earthquake engineering simulation, , OpenSees.

The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of waiting time values in the original catalogue that can be regarded as statistically distinguishable or indistinguishable from the baseline time intervals datasets where the original structure of the temporal distribution of earthquakes was disrupted. We compiled two types of time structure-distorted baseline sequences, which comprised mean values of: (a) shuffled original interevent data and (b) interevent times data from time-randomized catalogues. To compare the dynamical characteristics of the original and time structure-distorted baseline sequences, we used several data analysis methods such as power spectrum regression, detrended fluctuation, and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. We also tested the nonlinear structure of the original and baseline sequences using the magnitude and sign scaling analysis method. We calculated theZscore in order to assess whether the interevent time values in the original dataset shared statistical similarity or dissimilarity with the time structure-distorted baseline interevent data sequence. We compared the interevent time values in the original dataset with the mean baseline interevent times computed for two types of time structure-distorted sequences. The results showed that about 30% of the original interevent times were statistically indistinguishable from the mean of the shuffled dataset and 10% from the mean of the time structure-distorted baseline interevent dataset. We performed similar analyses for other catalogues obtained from different parts of the world. According to the results of this analysis, the proportion of events in the original catalogues that were indistinguishable from sequences with disturbed time structure did not contradict the results obtained for the Southern California catalogue. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Correlation; Dynamics; Interevent time; Seismicity; Statistics","Goltz, C., (1998) Fractal and Chaotic Properties of Earthquakes, , Lecture Notes in Earth Sciences Springer Berlin; Matcharashvili, T., Chelidze, T., Javakhishvilli, Z., Nonlinear analysis of magnitude and interevent time interval sequences for earthquakes of the Caucasian region (2000) Nonlin.

Here, we implement a novel way to aggregate these separate measures of disaster impact and apply it to two catastrophic events from 2011: the Christchurch (New Zealand) earthquakes and the Greater Bangkok (Thailand) flood. This new measure, which is similar to the World Health Organization's calculation of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost due to the burden of diseases and injuries, is described in detail in Noy [7]. It allows us to conclude that New Zealand lost 180 thousand lifeyears as a result of the 2011 events, and Thailand lost 2644 thousand lifeyears.

A set of 30 archetype RC moment frames, designed based on the ASCE 7-05 and ACI 318-05 requirements, is selected for the evaluation purpose. The buildings are classified into 4-, 8- and 12-story and are designed with different levels of structural system ductility. The archetypes are assumed to be located in three zones with low, moderate and high levels of seismic hazard. The findings of the collapse assessment procedure indicate that the seismicity of the location significantly affects the collapse performance and the ductility, as long as the structure conforms to the requirements of modern design codes, has the least influence on the collapse risk. Also, it has been found that the expected annual repair costs lie in an interval with the minimum and maximum of 0.02% and 1.5% of the replacement cost and expected annual number of deaths ranges from 2×10-4% to 29×10-3% of the total occupants with the buildings located in the low seismicity zone having the minimum amounts of losses.

We determine the expected damages and the concentration demands on short piers of bridges with columns of unequal height located on soft and rigid soil sites. Medium length span bridges are analyzed using the most common structural configurations built in many countries with several height pier configurations. The structures were subjected to strong seismic ground motions recorded on soft and hard soils of earthquakes generated at subduction seismic sources. The parameters of interest in the study are the strength and stiffness characteristics of the substructure and the influence of the dynamic characteristics of the seismic records. The parameter combinations produced more than three hundred 3D non-linear time history analyses conducted with the Perform-3D software. Based on the evaluation of damages indexes, we determine the pier expected damages and the importance of the soil type, on the behavior of irregular pier bridge substructures. It is also quantified the impact of the pier configuration in the global behavior of the bridges and the influence of the shortest pier in the expected damages of the other piers. In most of the cases, the piers adjacent to the tallest piers of the bridge were the elements more affected by the irregularity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bridges on hard and soft soil conditions; Damage index; Pier irregularity; Seismic response of irregular bridges","(2010) LFRD bridge design specifications, , Washington, DC, USA: American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials; Akbari, R., Seismic fragility analysis of reinforced concrete continuous span bridges with irregular configuration (2012) Struct Infrastruct Eng, 8 (9), pp. 873-889; Alabanesi, T., Lavorato, D., Nuti, C., Santini, S., (2008) Experimental test on repaired and retrofitted bridge piers, , Tailor Made Concrete Structures, Taylor & Francis Group, ISBN 978-0-415-45535-8; Cosenza, E., Manfredi, G., Ramasco, R., The use of damage functionals in earthquake-resistant design: a comparison among different procedures (1993) Struct Dyn Earthq Eng, 22, pp. 855-868; (2010), SAP2000 V14.2.

Permanent plastic deformation of steel rebars is among the main reasons for the disruption of the functionality of RC structures after major seismic events. It can also pose life threatening risks in case of strong aftershock occurrence. In an attempt to address the problem of excessive permanent deformations and their impact on the post-earthquake functionality of concrete moment resisting frame (MRF) structures, this paper studies analytically a new type of reinforcing bars made of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) with embedded superelastic shape memory alloy (SMA) fibers. SMA-FRP reinforcement is characterized with both ductility and pseudo-elasticity which are two important characteristics that are sough in this study to enhance the ability of RC moment frames to withstand strong sequential ground motions (i.e. main shock followed by one or more aftershocks). In this study, experimentally validated SMA-FRP material models are used in structural level models to assess the performance of RC frame structures under seismic loading. Three-story, one-bay prototype RC MRFs, reinforced with steel and SMA-FRP composite reinforcements are first designed using performance based criteria and then subjected to incremental dynamic analysis under sequential ground motions. Comparison is drawn between steel and SMA-FRP reinforced frames based on accumulation of damage and residual drifts. Numerical results show superior performance of SMA-FRP composite reinforced MRF in terms of dissipation of energy and accumulation of lower residual drifts. Increased demands from the effects of aftershock causes accumulation of residual drifts in steel reinforced frames which is mitigated in SMA-FRP reinforced frame through re-centering capability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Aftershocks; Concrete; Fiber reinforced polymer; Moment resisting frames; Performance based design; Shape memory alloys; Superelastic","Elnashai, A.S., Luigi, D.S., (2008) Fundamentals of earthquake engineering, , Wiley, New York; Nakahara, H., Saniko, K., Esaki, F., Experimental study for developing self-centering RC structural frames with column yielding mechanism (2008) J Struct Constr Eng AIJ, 73 (628), pp. 957-964; Fahmy, M.F.M., Wu, Z., Wu, G., Sun, Z., Post-yield stiffnesses and residual deformations of RC bridge columns reinforced with ordinary rebars and steel fiber composite bars (2010) Eng Struct, 32, pp. 2969-2983; Saiidi, M., Zadeh, M., Ayoub, C., Itani, A., A pilot study of behavior of concrete beams reinforced with shape memory alloys (2007) J Smart Mater Civil Eng ASCE, 19 (6), pp. 454-461; Nehdi, M., Alam, M.S., Youssef, M.A., Development of corrosion-free concrete beam column joint with adequate seismic energy dissipation (2009) Eng Struct, 32, pp. 2518-2528; Speicher, M.S., DesRoches, R., Leon, R.T., Experimental results of a NiTi shape memory alloy SMA)-based recentering beam-column connection (2011) Eng Struct, , [04.018]; Wierschem, N., Andrawes, B., Superelastic SMA-FRP composite reinforcement for concrete structures (2010) J Smart Mater Struct, 19, p. 13; Naito, H., Sato, J., Funami, K., Matsuzaki, Y., Ikeda, T., Analytical study on training effects of pseudoelastic transformation of shape memory alloys in cyclic loading (2001) J Intell Mater Syst Struct, 12, pp. 295-300; Zafar, A., Andrawes, B., Fabrication and cyclic behavior of highly ductile superelastic shape memory composites (2013) ASCE J Mater Civ Eng; Li, Q., Ellingwood, B.R., Performance evaluation and damage assessment of steel frame buildings under main shock-aftershock sequences (2007) Earthq Eng Struct Dynam, 36, pp. 405-427; Weng Kam, Y., Pampanin, S., The seismic performance of RC buildings in the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake (2011) Struct Concr, 12 (4); Nishiyama, I., Okawa, I., Fukuyama, H., Okuda, Y., Building damages by the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku earthquake and coping activities by NILIM and BRI collaborated with the administration, , Report by National Institute for Land & Infrastructure Management (NILIM) and Building Research Institute (BRI); Garcia, J.R., Moreno, J.Y., Maldonado, I.A., Evaluation of existing Mexican highway bridges under mainshock-aftershock seismic sequences (2008) Proceedings of the 14th world conference on earthquake engineering, , Paper 05-02-0090.

However, specific provision to evaluate quantitatively the increased bar-concrete bond and shear strengths in the beam-column joint is not given in current design codes. In the present study, cyclic loading tests were performed for beam-column connections of which joint detailing was improved by placing additional 45° bent bars and 90° hooked bars. The test results showed that despite small h<inf>c</inf>/. d<inf>b</inf> values, by using the improved details, bond-slip of beam flexural bars and diagonal cracking were substantially decreased in the joint. To address the enhanced performance in the design of beam-column joints, the bond resistance and joint shear strength were quantitatively redefined considering the details of the additional bars. In addition, the relationship between the bond parameter and energy dissipation capacity was proposed.

Such natural disasters have caused damage to some bridges, consequently isolating residential communities located on mountains, and hampering the ability to delivery emergency relief supplies to those communities. In order to provide quick emergency relief, the simple construction of a temporary bridge becomes critical for the transportation of food and medical supplies into the emergency disaster areas. While composite materials for footbridges and vehicular traffic applications have been widely used overseas, they are not suitable for disaster relief applications. The objective of this paper is to present a novel bridge structure for a portable, reusable, and lightweight bridge. This paper focuses on the design concept and experimental verification of a temporary composite bridge for disaster relief. Ultimately, it advocates composite bridges for disaster relief applications. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cable-stayed composite bridge; Composite emergency bridge; Lightweight, portable and reusable bridge","Cheng, L., Karbhari, V.M., New bridge systems using FRP composites and concrete: a state-of-the-art review, readers write (2006) Prog Struct Eng Mater, 8 (4), pp. 143-154; Hollaway, L.C., The evolution of and the way forward for advanced polymer composite in the civil infrastructure (2001) Proceedings of the international conference on FRP composites in civil engineering, pp. 27-40. , Elsevier Science Ltd, Hong Kong; Seible, F., Sun, Z., Ma, G., Glass fiber composite bridges in China (1993), ACTT-93/01, University of California, San DiegoArio, I., Development of a prototype deployable bridge based on origami skill (2013) Autom Constr, 32, pp. 104-111; Lederman, G., A novel deployable tied arch bridge (2014) Eng Struct, 70, pp. 1-10; Teixeira, A.M.A.J., Structural evaluation of a GFRP truss girder for a deployable bridge (2014) Compos Struct, 110, pp. 29-38; (2004) FRP Bridge-Technologies and Prospects, , Japan Society of Civil Engineers, [in Japanese]; Sedlacek, G., Trumpf, H., Mobile light-weight fixed bridges out of pultruded fiber-reinforced polymer profiles (2002) Sci Eng Compos Mater, 10 (6), pp. 383-395; Erki, M.A., Shyu, C.R., Wight, R.G., Multiple bolted connections in pultruded FRP composites (2005), In: Proceedings, Annual conference-Canadian society for civil engineering, GC-218-1-7Nguyen, D.H., Hiroshi, M., Behavior of bolted/bonded joints in pultruded hybrid CFRP/GFRP composites (2010) J Struct Eng, 56 A, pp. 23-31; Specification for structural steel buildings: allowable stress design.

However, it is unrealistic to collect a sufficient amount of human performance data from a real event, such as a great earthquake. As one of the promising solutions, a conceptual framework is suggested in this paper, which is helpful for estimating the response time data of human operators working in the main control room of NPPs under a seismic event. To this end, the four kinds of representative contexts that could be anticipated from seismic events are identified. Then the response times of human operators who are faced with similar contexts are reviewed from existing literatures and databases. As a result, a couple of rules that allow us to extrapolate the response times of human operators under seismic events are extracted. Although underlying rationales being used for determining these rules are still arguable, it is expected that response times under seismic events could be properly understood along with accumulating those of human operators against non-seismic conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Context-based estimation; Human reliability analysis; Probabilistic safety assessment; Response time; Seismic event","Amico, P., Strohm, A., Rattke, J., Advanced human reliability analysis in a seismic damage context (2011) Transactions on SMiRT 21, , New Delhi, India, paper # 595; ASME, ANS, Standard for level 1/large early release frequency probabilistic risk assessment for nuclear power plant applications (2013) American Society of Mechanical Engineers/American National Standard, Addenda to ASME/ANS RA-S-2008, RA-Sb-2013; Bell, J., Holroyd, J., Review of human reliability assessment methods Health and Safety Executive, HSE-RR679; Chang, J.I., Lin, C.C., A study of storage tank accidents (2006) J.

However, only very limited studies has investigated alterations of cortisone levels in stress-related mental disorder such as PTSD. The present study investigated the associations between PTSD symptomatology and hair cortisone levels which can reflect cumulative cortisone secretion over prolonged periods of time and is more robust to the influence of situational confounding. Methods Participants included 201 females who experienced 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and lost their children during the disaster. PTSD symptoms were assessed with the PTSD Checklist (PCL), and depression symptoms with the Center for epidemiological studies depression scale (CES-D). Hair cortisone levels were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer. Results The results indicated that although hair cortisone secretion could not distinguish traumatized individuals with and without PTSD, it was uniquely linked to dysphoric arousal symptoms, a key aspect of the complex PTSD phenotype Limitations A sample of females exposed to specific traumatic events was used, and PTSD was assessed using a self-reported measure. Conclusions The findings provide preliminary evidence supporting the critical role of long-term cortisone changes in the development and maintenance of PTSD symptoms, and add to extant knowledge on the neuroendocrinological underpinnings of posttraumatic psychopathology. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

On observation of the evolution of the maximum coreness, it is found that it has some sudden changes with the occurrence of major shocks. The highest core, which has high clustering characteristic, is tend to be located in the area that can directly or indirectly cause the major shocks.

Multispan continuous concrete box-girder bridges account for the bulk of the California bridge inventory. Although several studies have looked at the seismic response and fragility of individual box-girder bridges, very little research has explored the fragility of the box-girder bridge class holistically. Exacerbating this situation is the lack of considerations of design details unique to the era in which the bridges were designed and constructed, in their fragility development. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the influence of evolution of seismic design principles and details on the seismic performance of multispan continuous concrete box-girder bridge class, as well as the failure probability through the development of fragility curves across three design eras demarcated by the 1971 San Fernando and 1989 Loma Prieta earthquakes. Detailed nonlinear analytical models capturing the bridge characteristics within a design era are developed and nonlinear time history analysis is employed to develop analytical fragility curves. Significant improvement in performance is seen in modern bridges designed according to capacity design principles. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Box-girder bridges; Bridge classes; Evolution of bridge design philosophy; Fragility; HAZUS; Seismic design","Cornell, A.C., Krawinkler, H., Progress and challenges in seismic performance assessment (2000), http://peer.berkeley.edu/news/2000spring/index.html, PEER Center NewsMackie, K., Stojadinovic, B., Probabilistic seismic demand model for California bridges (2001) J Bridge Eng, 6, pp. 468-480; National bridge inventory data (2010), http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi/ascii.cfm, US Dept. of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, Washington, DCMackie, K., Stojadinovic, B., Fragility basis for California highway overpass bridge seismic decision making.

AMS analyses show that the Miocene units of the Upper Red Formation have a well defined magnetic fabric of tectonic origin, with both magnetic lineation and magnetic foliation oriented parallel to the regional fold axes. In most of the cases the magnetic fabric, acquired when the bedding was still horizontal, is related to different degrees of LPS shortening. In some other cases, the magnetic foliation is vertical and oblique to the bedding, suggesting that in the Ferdows thrust-fold structure a cleavage system, not visible at the outcrop scale, has been developed as a consequence of later shortening related to the activity of the thrust system, responsible of the recent earthquakes in the area. Results from this study establish a relationships between the recent tectonics of the area and the evolution of the magnetic fabric and demonstrate that a well defined magnetic fabric of pure tectonic origin can also develop in poorly deformed rocks lacking field evidence of pervasive internal deformation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","AMS; Central Iran; Cleavage; LPS","Allen, M., Jackson, J., Walker, R., Late Cenozoic reorganization of the Arabia-Eurasia collision and the comparison of short-term and long-term deformation rates (2004) Tectonics, 23, p.

Mw). Originating in Sikkim-Nepal border with an intensity of VI+ in MSK scale, this earthquake caused collapse of both unreinforced masonry buildings, heritage structures and framed structures followed by landslides and mud slides at various places of Sikkim. Significant damages have been observed in relatively new framed structures mainly in Government buildings, thick masonry structures, while, the older wooden frame (. ekra) non-engineered structures performed well during the earthquake. Further, it is noteworthy that government buildings suffered more than private ones and damages were observed more in newer framed structures than older ones. Analysis of the damages identify lateral spreading of slope, pounding of buildings, out-of-plane rotation, generation of structural cracks, plastic hinge formation at column capitals and damage of infill wall material as predominant damage features. A few remedial measures are also attempted to be mentioned with future need of research and application. It has been felt to create awareness regarding these issues and is the need of the hour. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Damage analysis; Out-of-plane rotation; Plastic hinge; Pounding; Sikkim Earthquake; Soil deterioration; Structural crack","(2011), http://www.nicee.org/Preliminary_Report_2011_Sikkim_EQ.pdf, IIT Kanpur.

The earthquakes are classified into three categories based on spatial distributions and focal mechanisms of the inferred sub-events: 1) category one, with non-planar distribution and variable focal mechanisms of sub-events, represented by the 1994 Mw 8.2 Bolivia earthquake and the 2013 Mw 8.3 Okhotsk earthquake; 2) category two, with planar distribution but focal mechanisms inconsistent with the plane, including eighteen earthquakes; and 3) category three, with planar distribution and focal mechanisms consistent with the plane, including six earthquakes. We discuss possible physical mechanisms for earthquakes in each category in the context of plane rupture, transformational faulting and shear thermal instability. We suggest that the inferred source processes of large deep-focus earthquakes can be best interpreted by cascading failure of shear thermal instabilities in pre-existing weak zones, with the perturbation of stress generated by a shear instability triggering another and focal mechanisms of the sub-events controlled by orientations of the pre-existing weak zones. The proposed mechanism can also explain the observed great variability of focal mechanisms, the presence of large values of CLVD (Compensated Linear Vector Dipole) and the super-shear rupture of deep-focus earthquakes in the previous studies. In addition, our studies suggest existence of relationships of seismic moment ~ (source duration)3 and moment ~ (source dimension)3 in large deep-focus earthquakes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cascading failure; Deep-focus earthquake; Multiple source inversion; Pre-existing weak zone; Shear thermal instability","Antolik, M., Dreger, D., Romanowicz, B., Finite fault source study of the great 1994 deep Bolivia earthquake (1996) Geophys.

Five earthquakes with magnitudes over 5 that occurred during the past 30. years suggest the fault zone is a seismogenic structure with future seismic potential. The structural pattern, tectonic history, Quaternary activity and seismic potential have previously been unknown due to the Quaternary sedimentary coverage and lack of large historic earthquakes (. M>. 7). In this paper, we use seismic reflection profiles and drilling from petroleum explorations and shallow-depth seismic reflections to study those problems. The total length of the Da'an-Dedu Fault Zone is more than 400. km; modern seismicity delineates it into 4 segments each with a length of 90-100. km. In cross-section view, the folds and associated faults form a complex structural belt with a width of more than 10. km. Shallow-level seismic reflection across the Da'an-Dedu Fault Zone reveals that the Late Quaternary sediments were folded and faulted, indicating its present tectonic activity. The Da'an-Dedu Fault Zone and Songliao Basin have been subjected to three stages of tectonic evolution: a rifting stage characterized by normal faulting and extension (~145-112. Ma), a prolonged stage of thermal subsidence (~112-65. Ma), and a tectonic reversal that has been taking place since ~65. Ma. Our shallow-level reflection profiles show that the folding and reverse faulting have influenced the Late Quaternary sediments. The seismicity and moderate earthquakes suggest that the tectonic activity persists today. The deformation rate across the Da'an-Dedu Fault Zone, however, is measured to be very slow. In conjunction with the inference that most deformation in NE China may be taken up by the Yilan-Yitong Fault Zone bounding the Songliao Basin to the east, we suggest moderate earthquake potential and thus moderate seismic hazards along the Da'an-Dedu Fault Zone. The geological structures, which include anticlines and reverse faults, imply that the Da'an-Dedu Fault Zone has been a contractive structure since ~65. Ma, and this type of contraction dominates the tectonic deformation in the Songliao Basin and the entire NE China, although the reasons for these conditions need to be further studied. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Da'an-Dedu fault zone; Deformation characteristics; Earthquake swarms; Implications; Songliao basin","Allen, M.B., Macdonald, D.I.M., Xun, Z., Vincent, S.J., Brouet-Menzies, C., Early Cenozoic two-phase extension and late Cenozoic thermal subsidence and inversion of the Bohai basin, northern China (1997) Mar.

In this paper, an approximate strain-dependant Newmark sliding-block procedure for pile-reinforced slopes has been developed, for use in analysis and design of the piling scheme, and the model is validated against centrifuge test data. The interaction of the pile within the slipping soil was idealised using a non-linear elasto-plastic (. P-y) model, while the interaction within the underlying stable soil was modelled using an elastic response model in which (degraded) soil stiffness is selected for an appropriate amount of shear strain. This combined soil-pile interaction model was incorporated into the improved Newmark methodology for unreinforced slopes presented by Al-defae et al. [1], so that the final method additionally incorporates strain-dependent geometric hardening (slope re-grading). When combined with the strain-dependent pile resistance, the method is therefore applicable to analysis of both the mainshock and subsequent aftershocks acting on the deformed slope. It was observed that the single pile resistance is mobilised rapidly at the start of a strong earthquake and that this and the permanent slope deformation are therefore strongly influenced by pile stiffness properties, pile spacing and the depth of the slip surface. The model shows good agreement with the centrifuge test data in terms of the prediction of permanent deformation at the crest of the slope (important in design for selecting an appropriate pile layout/spacing i.e. S/. B) and in terms of the maximum permanent bending moments induced in the piles (important for appropriate structural detailing of the piles), so long as the slip surface depth can be accurately predicted. A method for doing this, based on limit analysis, is also presented and validated. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Analytical modeling; Centrifuge modelling; Piles; Sand; Slopes","Al-Defae, A.H., Caucis, K., Knappett, J.A., Aftershocks and the whole-life seismic performance of granular slopes (2013) Géotechnique, 63 (14), pp. 1230-1244; Liang, R.Y., (2002) Drilled shaft foundations of noise battier walls and slope stabilisation.

Box 5048, CN Delft/2600 GA Delft, Netherlands","Instability of submarine slopes and the risk posed by submarine slides are a concern in offshore activities related to energy, communications, food production and tourism. In particular, much of the offshore infrastructure needed for the extraction and transportation of hydrocarbons in deep waters are located on the continental slope, with significant exposure to the risk posed by a submarine landslide. Recent studies of the triggering mechanisms of a submarine landslide show that the combination of a predisposition factor like a weak layer within the soil profile, together with a ""short duration trigger"" such as an earthquake, is one of the most likely scenarios for slide initiation. In this paper, the influence of a weak layer on the stability of a submarine slope before, during and after a strong earthquake event is examined. The slope under study is located in the southern part of the Gulf of Mexico, on the continental slope in a water depth of 500m. The slope stability assessments in the study include static slope stability using the limit equilibrium method and the finite element method, pseudo-static analyses using the limit equilibrium method, as well as 1-D and 2-D non-linear dynamic analyses using the finite element method. The earthquake-induced shear strains within the soil deposit are a key parameter in the slope stability assessment. Therefore, the dynamic analyses focused on estimating the maximum and permanent shear strains within the soil profile.Given the complexity of the problem, the decrease of the soil strength during and after the earthquake loading was estimated through a decoupled approach based on the calculated shear strains and results of advanced laboratory tests. The results of the study show quantitatively the important role of a weak layer in the initiation of a submarine landslide under a strong earthquake. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Advanced laboratory tests; Earthquake; Numerical analyses; Offshore geohazards; Submarine landslide; Submarine slope; Weak layer","Andersen, K., Lunne, T., Kvalstad, T., Forsberg, C., Deep water geotechnical engineering (2012) Norwegian Geotechnical Institute, , Publication No. 208, Oslo, Norway, NGI (Ed.); Biscontin, G., Pestana, J.M., Nadim, F., Seismic triggering of submarine slides in soft cohesive soil deposits (2004) Mar.

In all these evaluations, the results were compared with those by the currently used stress-based method (SBM) under exactly the same seismic and geotechnical conditions. It was found that EBM yields similar results with SBM for several ground motions of recent earthquakes but has easier applicability without considering associated parameters. In Urayasu city, the two methods yielded nearly consistent results by using an appropriate coefficient in SBM for the M9.0 earthquake, though both overestimated the actual liquefaction performance, probably because effects of plasticity and aging on in situ liquefaction strength were not taken into account. In Tanno-cho, EBM could evaluate actual liquefaction performance due to a small-acceleration motion during a far-field large magnitude earthquake while SBM could not. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Case history; Energy-based method; Liquefaction potential evaluation; Seismic wave energy; Stress-based method","Davis, R.O., Berrill, J.B., Energy dissipation and seismic liquefaction of sands (1982) Earthq Eng Struct Dyn, 10, pp. 59-68; Kayen, R.E., Mitchell, J.K., Assessment of liquefaction potential during earthquakes by arias intensity (1997) J Geotech Geoenviron Eng, 123 (12), pp. 1162-1174; Arias, A., A measure of earthquake intensity (1970) Seismic design of nuclear power plants, pp. 438-483. , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, R.J.

The dam presents a 90. m tall embankment built in a narrow canyon and is situated in a highly seismic region. The implemented methodology encompasses the indications provided by the most recent literature to point out the problems potentially caused by earthquakes and to account for the paramount factors affecting the response of the dam. Particular attention has been paid to the concept of performance, defining its goals in accordance with the most recent standards and deriving the correspondent limit conditions from observations reported in the literature. In order to optimize the computational effort, dynamic analyses with two and three dimensional finite difference codes have been combined to study the coupled response of the embankment, rocky foundation and bituminous facing. After validating the numerical models with centrifuge tests performed on small scale models of the embankment, the performance of the dam has been investigated with reference to a number of possible scenarios focusing on the amplification spectra, the deformation of the embankment and the integrity of the bituminous lining. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bituminous facing; Earthquake; Hazard mitigation; Limit states; Performance; Rockfill dam","EN 1998-1, Eurocode 8.

The stratigraphic units at the JFAST site are compared to undeformed Western Pacific sediments from two reference sites (Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1149 and Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 436). The trace element fingerprints in these reference sedimentary units can be correlated to individual JFAST samples. At the JFAST site, we find that the accretionary wedge and downgoing plate sediments in the core are composed primarily of Holocene to Eocene sediments. There are several age reversals and gaps within the sequence, consistent with multiple faults in the bottom 15 m of the JFAST core. Our results point to several candidate faults that could have slipped during the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, in addition to the pelagic clay layer that has been proposed as the main décollement fault. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","DSDP Site 436; IODP Expedition 343; ODP Site 1149; Pacific plate stratigraphy; Shallow subduction structure; Tohoku earthquake","Ammon, C.J., Lay, T., Kanamori, H., Cleveland, M., A rupture model of the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake (2011) Earth Planets Space, 63, pp. 693-696; Anderson, R.F., Bacon, M.P., Brewer, P.G., Removal of 230Th and 231Pa at ocean margins (1983) Earth Planet.

Dry experiments show classical Dieterich healing characterized by a transient peak in friction after each hold period, with no effects of SHS testing on steady-state friction or velocity dependence. By contrast, the wet tests show 1) an increase in apparent steady-state friction upon re-sliding after a hold period, and 2) a pronounced increase in the velocity dependence parameter, (a- b), after the SHS stage. While the first of these ""non-Dieterich-type"" healing effects has been observed in previous hydrothermal experiments on simulated quartz gouges, it has not been reported previously for carbonate gouges. The observed effect of SHS-testing on (a- b) has never been reported. Our findings suggest that, under in-situ hydrothermal conditions, interseismic fluid-assisted deformation processes, such as pressure solution, can significantly promote fault re-strengthening in carbonates and can cause slip stabilization. If the results are applicable to active faults in carbonate terrains, they have important implications for understanding how the extent of the seismogenic zone, and how earthquake magnitude and aftershock distributions, may evolve with repeated cycles of natural seismicity and interseismic healing. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Carbonate gouge; Frictional healing; Hydrothermal conditions; Slip stabilization","Beeler, N.M., Tullis, T.E., Weeks, J.D., Frictional behavior of large displacement experimental faults (1996) J.

Initially, shock spectra were calculated from base motion measurements of internal equipment and components. Attempts were made to envelop these spectra to develop shock design spectra inputs. At that time, earthquake engineers were using this enveloping method to develop design procedures from ground motion measurements to protect structures from earthquakes. However, for the measurements on ships, this procedure resulted in calculated loads that would have caused catastrophic failure of the equipment; yet the equipment had not failed on the ship tests. As a result, the data were re-analyzed over a period of over a year. It was concluded that the dynamic interaction of each component or structure reduced the measured spectral motion at the fixed-base frequencies of the structure by about an order of magnitude. In many cases, there was a dip in the shock spectra at the fixed-base frequencies: the ""spectrum dip"" phenomenon. This re-analysis led to shock spectra design curves for navy ships. This paper presents a review of an experimental study and analytical demonstration to explain the effect of dynamic interaction on the shock or response spectrum. In addition, a practical example of interaction of four single mass dynamic systems mounted on a realistic deck and subjected to a high impact shock input was studied by the authors and some of the results of that study are included.

To achieve this, simplified relations for the estimation of (1) point rotations; (2) spatial variation of strong ground motions, and (3) foundation input motions are derived. The height-wise variation of the earthquake rotational loading of multi-storey buildings is parametrically evaluated by considering the location of the first rigid floor diaphragm and foundation type. In addition, the effect of the kinematic soil-structure interaction on the response spectrum of the rotational and translational components is studied. The numerical results provide a deeper insight into the rotational loading of structures in the middle-field zone, and show how the rotational components may detrimentally affect the structural response of multi-storey buildings depending on their kinematic characteristics. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Coherency; Kinematic soil-structure interaction; Phase delay; Point, surface, and foundation rotation; Random vibration analysis; Response spectrum; Spatial variation of strong ground motion","Newmark, N.M., Torsion in symmetrical building (1969) Proc. fourth world conf. earthquake eng, pp. 19-32. , Santiago, Chile 2, A.3; Trifunac, M.D., A note on rotational components of earthquake motions on ground surface for incident body waves (1982) Int J Soil Dyn Earthquake Eng, 1, pp. 11-19; Ghafory-Ashtiany, M., Singh, M.P., Structural response for six correlated earthquake components (1986) Earthquake Eng Struct Dyn, 14, pp. 103-119; Basu, D., Whittaker, A.S., Constantinou, M.C., Estimating rotational components of ground motion using data recorded at a single station (2012) J Eng Mech, 138, pp. 1141-1156; Basu, D., Whittaker, A.S., Constantinou, M.C., Extracting rotational components of earthquake ground motion using data recorded at multiple stations (2013) Earthquake Eng Struct Dyn, 42, pp. 451-463; Li, B., Al-Bermani, F.G.A., Kitipornchai, S., Maximum response of asymmetric structures subject to a multicomponent earthquake (1993) Earthquake Eng Struct Dyn, 22, pp. 1047-1066; Veletsos, A.S., Prasad, A.M., Wu, W.H., Transfer functions for rigid rectangular foundations (1997) Earthquake Eng Struct Dyn, 26, pp. 5-17; Rutenberg, A., Heidebrecht, A.C., Response spectra for torsion, rocking and rigid foundations (1985) Earthquake Eng Struct Dyn, 13, pp. 543-557; Zembaty, Z., Boffi, G., Effect of rotational seismic ground motion on dynamic response of slender towers (1994) Eur Earthquake Eng, 1, pp. 3-11; Hao, H., Characteristics of torsional ground motions (1996) Earthquake Eng Struct Dyn, 25, pp. 599-610; Ghayamghamian, M.R., Nouri, G.R., On the characteristics of ground motion rotational components using Chiba dense array data (2007) Earthquake Eng Struct Dyn, 36, pp. 1407-1429; Ghafory-Ashtiany, M., Singh, M.P., (1984) Seismic response for multi-component earthquakes, , Report no.

In this area, research findings related to the continuous- vs detached-slab transition are diffused on a wide sector running from central Calabria to the southern Apennines tip and different locations of a subduction-transform edge propagator (STEP) have also been proposed in the recent literature. We present seismic data and analyses aimed to investigate the location of the northern edge of the in-depth continuous slab and the present-day kinematics of the concerned boundary region by also focusing on the possible clues of STEP fault activity. We used both standard linearized and non-linear probabilistic methods to locate, in a recently developed shallow-to-intermediate 3D velocity model, the seismicity that occurred between 1997 and 2012 at the Ionian slab northern boundary. Earthquake kinematics have also been investigated by integrating high-quality focal mechanisms selected from the literature with 70 waveform inversion solutions obtained in the present study.The results allow to identify in central Calabria the northern edge of the in-depth continuous slab and just north of it a ca. 100. km-wide deformation zone reflecting lateral STEP migration in the slab edge area. The migration likely indicates an alternation of tear propagation along a slab edge and slab break-off progressively reducing the lateral extension of the subduction zone. In this framework, the recent seismicity seems also to suggest the possible location of an incipient shallow slab break-off beneath central Calabria. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Fault plane solutions; Ionian subduction zone; Seismicity; Subduction-transform edge propagator","Alpert, L.A., Becker, T.W., Bailey, I.W., Global slab deformation and centroid moment tensor constraints on viscosity (2010) Geochem.

This study investigates the cyclic simple shear responses of three sandy soils: clean sand (Sile Sand 20/55), silty sand (Sile Sand 20/55 with 10% IZ silt) and clayey sand (Sile Sand 20/55 with 10% kaolin) based on many dry and saturated specimens. Drained constant volume cyclic simple shear tests on clean and silty sand specimens have shown that liquefaction potential of those soils could also be determined via dry samples. This is an important observation, since dry specimens are much easier to prepare and less time consuming compared to their saturated counterparts, as the demanding saturation process is eliminated. However, cyclic responses of dry and saturated clayey sand specimens were shown to be quite different, and therefore saturation of these specimens is still a must for liquefaction assessment. For both silt and kaolin, adding 10% fines to the base sand increased the liquefaction potential of resulting sandy soils considerably compared to the clean sand at the same void ratio. But this difference relatively decreased as the specimens became looser. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Clay; Cyclic loading; Liquefaction; Sand; Silt; Simple shear testing","Akin, O., Monkul, M.M., Eseller-Bayat, E., Homogenous and saturated specimen preparation methods for simple shear test (2013) Proceedings of the 5th geotechnical symposium, , Paper no:27, Cukurova University, Adana, Türkiye (CD-ROM) (In Turkish);

The direct method consists of explicitly modeling the surrounding soil to bedrock and the structure resting on the soil. For the soil medium, usually the traditional equivalent linear method with a reduced shear modulus and an increased damping ratio for the soil is used. However, this method does not work in the vicinity of foundation where the soil behavior is highly nonlinear because of presence of large strains. This research proposes a modified equivalent linear method with a further reduction of the soil shear modulus in the near-field of foundation that results in validity of using the equivalent linear method throughout. For regular short, intermediate and tall structures resting on such soft soils, a series of dynamic time-history analysis is implemented using earthquake records scaled to a sample design spectrum and the nonlinear structural responses are compared for different assumptions of soil behavior including the elasto-plastic Mohr-Coulomb, the traditional equivalent linear, and the proposed modified equivalent linear method.

The main aims of the numerical investigations are: (1) to carry out a sufficiently wide sensitivity study on different specific case studies to have an insight into the role played by the geometry - which is always unique for churches - and by the irregularities; (2) to validate or address the limits of applicability of the most widespread conventional static approaches recommended by Italian Code, i.e. kinematic limit and pushover analyses. Non-linear dynamic analyses are carried out assuming that masonry behaves as a non-linear material exhibiting softening and damage, frictional behavior and different strength in tension and compression. The set of case studies investigated in this work shows how conventional static approaches are still capable of roughly identifying the most critical macro-elements that usually activate a failure mechanism, but that the results (e.g. collapse acceleration, behavior factor) are affected by a level of approximation that may considerably depend on in-plan irregularity and hypotheses done on the interlocking between contiguous walls. From the comparative analyses carried out, it is authors' opinion that it is always beneficial to perform different types of analysis in order to have a comprehensive insight into the portions of the structure that can suffer a partial collapse with high probability. Once the active mechanism is identified, non-linear dynamic analyses, with more sophisticated material models and with refined FE discretizations of the critical regions, may be useful to deepen the knowledge of the behavior of such complex structures under seismic actions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Conventional static approaches; Failure analysis of masonry churches; Failure mechanisms; FE models; Non-linear dynamic analyses","Doglioni, F., Moretti, A., Petrini, V., Le chiese e il terremoto.

A back-analysis with simplified procedures based on empirical correlations reveals a small liquefaction potential, which apparently underestimates the observed surface effects. Multiple and close-in-time events were a peculiar aspect of the sequence but cannot be accounted for within the simplified procedure. This study investigates their possible role in excess pore pressure build-up and hence liquefaction triggering. Results of a numerical analysis suggest that aftershocks played a determinant role, leading liquefaction phenomena to such a great extent as observed in the field.

To this end, a combination of Fourier cosine integral transform for depth and Hankel integral transform for radial distance are used, which translate the boundary value problem to a singular integral equation for the shear stress comes out from the continuity of two layers. The integral equation is solved for some collocation points with a smoothed variable of distance, which is adapted with the use of a free parameter. It is shown that, although the shear stress is highly singular, it does not highly depend on this free parameter. Both the analytical and numerical results are verified with both the static isotropic and dynamic transversely isotropic homogeneous cases. In addition, some new graphical results are presented for more understanding in engineering point of view. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Cylindrical cavity; Half-space; Torsion; Two-layered transversely isotropic","Ardeshir-Behrestaghi, A., Eskandari-Ghadi, M., Navayi Neya, B., Vaseghi-Amiri, J., Dynamic Reissner-Sagoci problem for a transversely isotropic half-space containing finite length cylindrical cavity (2014) Soil Dyn.

However, in eastern Hainan Island, China, few near-field geodetic observations are available; thus, the in situ crustal movement remains poorly understood. In this study, the deformation field of the eastern Hainan Island region was captured from 2007 to 2011 by applying the stacking-InSAR approach to ALOS PALSAR images. The results exhibit a trough deformation pattern that extends along the small to moderate earthquake belt with a maximum peak-to-trough range change rate of approximately 9. mm/year. We propose that a magma-fed dyke is responsible for the observed surface deformation pattern. The modeled dyke is approximately 54. km long, 1. km wide, dipping 71° to the west, centered 25. km fixed during modeling beneath eastern Hainan Island, and strikes nearly N-S, parallel to the elongated pattern of seismicity in the area. We infer that the regional stress field favors the formation of dyke beneath eastern Hainan Island; consequently, the intruding magma has accumulated in an elongated, dyke-like storage zone. The zone dilated progressively over time, accompanied by sporadic earthquakes and subtle surface deformation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Dyke-intrusion; Hainan Island; InSAR; Large-scale deformation; Satellite geodesy","Aldersons, F., Ben-Avraham, Z., Hofstetter, A., Kissling, E., Al-Yazjeen, T., Lower-crustal strength under the Dead Sea basin from local earthquake data and rheological modeling (2003) Earth Planet.

With reconsolidation, during which process excess pore pressure is dissipated, the shear strength and stiffness can be regained. However, due to the low permeability of silts (compared to sands), the dissipation of excess pore pressure and the reconsolidation of low-plasticity silt takes much more time. This paper investigates the postliquefaction shear behavior of Mississippi River Valley (MRV) silt at various degrees of reconsolidation using triaxial tests. Test results indicate that there was a steady increase, in shear strength and stiffness, at both large and small deformations, with increase in the degree of reconsolidation. The postliquefaction silt showed the effect of the apparent OCR, which had a close effect on postcyclic shear behavior as did the OCR on the static behavior. The critical state lines of MRV silt were different for pre- and post-liquefaction conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Critical state line; Low-plasticity silt; Postliquefaction behavior; Reconsolidation","Wang, W.S., (1979) Some findings in soil liquefaction, , Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Power Scientific Research Institute, Beijing; Boulanger, R.W., Meyers, M.W., Mejia, L.H., Idriss, I.M., Behavior of a fine-grained soil during the Loma Prieta earthquake (1998) Can Geotech J, 35, pp. 146-158; Bray, J.D., Sancio, R.B., Assessment of the liquefaction susceptibility of fine-grained soils (2006) J Geotech Geoenviron Eng, 132 (9), pp. 1165-1177; Bray, J.D., Frost, D., (2010) Geo-engineering reconnaissance of the 2010 Maule, Chile earthquake, , Report no.

Such analyses are computationally expensive and the results are hard to evaluate. Therefore, a simple numerical model is needed for engineering and design offices to determine the seismic demand of steel pipes at fault crossings. This paper presents a simplified numerical model for buried steel pipes crossing strike-slip faults and oriented perpendicular to the fault. Two pipes with different diameter to thickness (. D/. t) ratios and steel grades are used in the study. The proposed model permits plastic hinge formations in the pipe due to incrementally applied fault movements, allows determination of the critical length of the pipeline and measure strains developed on the tension and compression sides in the pipe. The model also considers the effect of bending as well as axial strains due to stretching. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Buried steel pipes; Continuous pipelines; Critical pipe length; Damage; Fault crossings","Abdoun, T.H., Ha, D., O'Rourke, M.J., Symans, M.D., O'Rourke, T.D., Palmer, M.C., Factors influencing the behavior of buried pipelines subjected to earthquake faulting (2009) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 29, pp. 415-427; Akbas, B., O'Rourke, M., Uckan, E., Shen, J., Caglar, M., Performance-based design of buried steel pipes at fault crossings (2015), In: Proceedings of the ASME 2015 pressure and vessels & piping conference PVP2015-45662 PVP 2015; July 19-23,.

However, the transverse faults in the Kuqa Foreland Basin, the most important gas producing area in China, have rarely been studied. Interpreted seismic sections and earthquake focal mechanism solutions, as well as other geological and geophysical data, allow us to identify a few widely-spaced, approximately NS trending, transverse strike-slip faults separating major structural units, and to clarify the geometry and kinematics of these transverse faults hidden below thrust faults. In the Kuqa Foreland Basin, two major structural domains can be distinguished. Transverse faults in the northern Kuqa Foreland Basin are mainly NNE trending sinistral, indicating clockwise-rotation of fault-bounded blocks. In contrast, the predominant NW trending dextral faults in the southern Kuqa Foreland Basin imply counterclockwise-rotation of fault-bounded blocks. We propose a tectonic model in which crustal blocks are bounded by strike-slip faults in a zone of simple shear rotation about vertical axis. The strike-slip faulting and thrust faulting in the Kuqa Foreland Basin suggest that some of the convergence between South Tianshan and Tarim blocks may have been accommodated not only by obvious crustal shortening and thickening along thrust faults, but also by rotation and possible lateral movement of the crust along transverse faults. Controlled by the remote collision of Indian block with Eurasian block since the Miocene, these reactivated substratum faults, which may inherit from Paleozoic deformation, control various elements relevant to gas accumulation in the Kuqa Foreland Basin which should expect to be paid more attention in the future. These elements include maturity of Tertiary and Jurassic source rocks, a difference in the regional cap of Kumugelimu salt beds from east to west, reservoir bed properties, gas migration channels, and traps formation. In addition, the strike-slip faulting of the transverse faults may affect deformation of the sedimentary cover, including making the western Qiulitag structural belt to form an arcuated structure curved to the SSW. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Deformation of sedimentary cover; Focal solution; Kuqa foreland basin; Petroleum geology; Transverse fault","Baker, C., Jackson, J., Priestley, K., Earthquakes on the Kazerun Line in the Zagros Mountains of Iran: strike-slip faulting within a fold-and-thrust belt (1993) Geophys.

In particular, the Song Ma fault zone plays an important role in understanding the mechanism and revolution of the collision between the Indian plate and Eurasian plate. In order to have better understanding the seismotectonic structures of the Song Ma fault zone, a three-year project is proposed to study the seismotectonic structures of crust in this region. The main goal of this project is to deploy temporary broad-band seismic stations around/near the shear zone to record high quality microearthquakes. By using the data recorded by the temporary array and the local seismic network, we are able to conduct seismological studies which include using waveform inversion to obtain precise fault plane solutions of microearthquakes, one-dimensional (1-D) velocity structure of the crust in the region as well as the characteristics of seismogeneric zone. From the results of earthquake relocation and focal mechanisms, we find that the spatial distribution of events occurred in Song Ma fault zone forms in several distinct groups which are well correlated local geological structures and further use to gain insights on tectonic evolution. © 2015.","1D velocity structure; Song Ma fault zone; Vp; Vs","Bai, L., Tian, X., Ritsema, J., Crustal structure beneath the Indochina Peninsula from teleseismic receiver functions (2010) Geophys.

In particular, the Gondola Slide was originally interpreted as part of a single collapse event that affected the SWAM during the LGM. New high-resolution swath-bathymetry and seismic data were successively acquired to refine and complete the coverage of the Gondola Slide. The new data are used here to detail the architecture of the Gondola Slide, a failed mass involving 40km3 of sediments and affecting an area of 1050km2. They permit the subdivision of the Gondola Slide into three elementary mass transport deposits (G1-, G2-, and G3-MTD), linked to distinct failure episodes, and thus to consider the Gondola Slide as a mass-transport complex (GS-MTC). The G1-MTD, which represents 90% of the entire sediment volume involved in the GS-MTC, is the product of a large failure whose source is in the mid-slope area, which propagated toward the upper-slope in a retrogressive style. The shape and the areal extent of the G1-MTD reflect the topographic confinement on the sliding mass by the pre-existing seafloor morphology of the SWAM. A significant part of the material involved in the G1 failure experienced in-situ remolding and deformation, undergoing only short-distance transport. Cross-cutting relationships of geomorphic elements show that the smaller scale G2- and G3-MTDs were emplaced following the main G1 event, likely as a consequence of late readjustment processes at the edges of the main body of the failed material. The re-examination of previously published and new sediment cores coupled with absolute dating control of tephra layers, means that we can infer the G1-MTD emplacement between 62 and 56kyrBP during the Late MIS 4/Early MIS 3. It also constrains the age of G2-MTD between 21 and 34kyrBP. The new age data predate previous estimates, which constrained the age of the entire GS-MTC during the MIS 2-glacial interval. We suggest that earthquakes are the more likely causes for the repeated failure events that struck the SWAM since, at least, the Late Pleistocene. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Adriatic Sea; Contourite; Debris flow; Landslide geomorphology; Magnetic susceptibility; Submarine landslide","Asioli, A., Trincardi, F., Lowe, J.J., Ariztegui, D., Langone, L., Oldfield, F., Sub-millennial scale climatic oscillations in the central Adriatic during the Lateglacial: palaeoceanographic implications (2001) Quaternary Science Review, 20, pp. 1201-1221; Bourne, A.J., (2012) The late Quaternary tephrochronology of the Adriatic region: implications for the synchronisation of marine records, , University of London, unpublished PhD Thesis; Bourne, A.J., Lowe, J.J., Trincardi, F., Asioli, A., Blockley, S.P.E., Wulf, S., Matthews, I.P., Vigliotti, L., Distal tephra record for the last ca 105,000years from core PRAD 1-2 in the central Adriatic Sea: implications for marine tephrostratigraphy (2010) Quat.

In this paper, we present an experimental study on the seismic performance of steel-polypropylene hybrid fiber reinforced concrete (HFRC) columns, which is of vital significance to postearthquake serviceability of structures. A total of 24 specimens subjected to combined constant axial load and cyclic lateral force were investigated. The main variables involve fiber type, shear span ratio, axial compression ratio, and reinforcement ratio (longitudinal and transverse). The failure modes, ultimate bearing capacity and deformation capacity were analyzed. The experimental results showed that the presence of hybrid fibers in RC columns had positive influence on improving the seismic bearing capacity. The improvement ratio could reach to 15-20% when a relative high axial compression was applied. Moreover, in comparison to RC columns, HFRC columns exhibited a notable synergetic effect in terms of ductility and energy dissipation capacity, particularly for columns with a higher axial compression ratio. Subsequently, on the basis of principles of equilibrium and compatibility, analytical equations to estimate the seismic bending moment capacity and shearing force capacity were developed, which took into account the synergetic effect of hybrid fibers. The analytical solutions were then validated by the test results, and the correlations were observed in reasonable accuracy. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, the dynamic road risk for pedestrian evacuation in a densely populated area of Beijing was studied with consideration of different influencing factors. Firstly, the eight influencing factors including road width, node degree, safety betweenness, road resistor coefficient, building threat, pedestrian counterflow, illegal vehicle parking and traffic flow were considered to assess the road risk for pedestrian evacuation. Secondly, based on complex network theory, electric circuit theory and real situation of the roads, the comprehensive assessment function for road risk was developed quantitatively based on the eight influencing factors. Thirdly, we analyzed road risk for pedestrian evacuation considering different situations: current condition, regular condition, and optimal condition; the risk distribution maps were drawn to directly show the risk level. Through assessments, the roads with high risk for pedestrian evacuation were found, and an optimized evacuation plan was obtained and analyzed. This mathematical model can guide the emergency evacuation in real time. The process and the results are essential for improving the efficiency of evacuations which should considerably reduce the possibility of injuries, deaths and other losses in the disaster. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Complex network; Disaster; Pedestrian evacuation; Risk analysis; Road risk","Hoogendoorn, S.P., Van Wageningen-Kessels, F.L.M., Daamen, W., Duives, D.C., Continuum modelling of pedestrian flows: From microscopic principles to self-organised macroscopic phenomena (2014) Physica A, 416, pp. 684-694; Bohannon, J., Directing the herd: Crowds and the science of evacuation (2005) Science, 310, pp. 219-221; Horner, M.W., Widener, M.J., The effects of transportation network failure on people's accessibility to hurricane disaster relief goods: A modeling approach and application to a Florida case study (2011) Nat.

The granular medium consisted of immersed stones giving a sediment bed thickness of 10. cm. High speed photographic and acoustic passive wireless techniques were employed to obtain the bubble size. The power spectra of the acoustic data for bubble production of 0.5 bubbles/s showed the existence of two principal peaks which are correlated with two discrete events. Firstly, a signal peak at 0.497. kHz, representing asymmetric bubble detachment, and secondly, a peak at 2.070. kHz, which corresponded to interactions of the granular media as inter-particle gaps advance, representing elastic resistance to orifice creation. Provided the signals were windowed to the bubble-detachment event only, the classical bubble-acoustical Minnaert relation for the bubble size agreed with optical data within about 10%. Since seepage generates discrete bubble pulses, appropriate acoustic analyses could both count and size the bubbles formed. The results of this study lead to the proposition that underwater acoustic sensors could warn of critical changes in bubble-seep behavior over time. This could lead to the possibility of remote early warnings, because shifts in production-rate regimes from seeps may herald alterations in the progression of global warming, or impending earthquakes and tsunamis. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Acoustic signals; Bubble detachment; Gas seeps; Hydrophone; Power spectra; Sediment bed","Al-Masry, W., Ali, E., Aqeel, Y., Determination of bubble characteristics in bubble columns using statistical analysis of acoustics sound measurements (2005) Chem.

For example, the 2012 Brawley swarm, which produced two strike-slip shocks with magnitudes larger than 5.3 and surface ruptures in the close vicinity of a geothermal field, started with earthquakes about 5 km deeper than the injection depth (~1.5 km). This makes the causality between the injection and seismicity unclear. Here, we jointly analyze broadband and strong motion waveforms, UAVSAR, leveling measurements and field observations to reveal the detailed seismic and aseismic faulting behaviors associated with the 2012 Brawley swarm. In particular, path calibration established from smaller events in the swarm allows waveform inversion to be conducted up to 3 Hz to resolve finite rupture process of the Mw 4.7 normal event. Our results show that the 2012 earthquake sequence was preceded by aseismic slip on a shallow normal fault beneath the geothermal field. Aseismic slip initiated in 2010 when injection rate rapidly increased and triggered the following earthquakes subsequently, including unusually shallow and relatively high frequency seismic excitations on the normal fault. In this example, seismicity is induced indirectly by fluid injection, a result of mediation by aseismic creep, rather than directly by a pore pressure increase at the location of the earthquakes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aseismic slip; Finite fault model; Fluid injection; Geothermal; High frequency waveform modeling; UAVSAR and InSAR","Allis, R.G., Zhan, X.Y., Predicting subsidence at Wairakei and Ohaaki geothermal fields, New Zealand (2000) Geothermics, 29, pp. 479-497; Bourouis, S., Bernard, P., Evidence for coupled seismic and aseismic fault slip during water injection in the geothermal site of Soultz (France), and implications for seismogenic transients (2007) Geophys.

Experimental data also showed that the coefficient of friction depends on several effects (i.e., sliding velocity, apparent pressure, air temperature, cycling effect) so that it can be assumed as a random variable. The aim of the study consists in evaluating the seismic reliability of a base-isolated structure with FP isolators considering both isolator properties (i.e., coefficient of friction) and earthquake main characteristics as random variables. Assuming appropriate density probability functions for each random variable and adopting the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) method for random sampling, the input data set has been defined. Several 3D non-linear dynamic analyses have been performed considering both the vertical and horizontal components of each seismic excitation in order to evaluate the system response. In particular, monovariate and multivariate (joint) probability density and cumulative distribution functions have been computed and, considering the limit state thresholds and domains (performance objectives) defined respectively on mono/bi-directional displacements, assumed as earthquake damage parameter (EDP) according to performance-based seismic design, the exceeding probabilities (structural performances) have been evaluated. Estimating the reliability of the superstructure, substructure and isolation level led to define and propose reliability-based abacus and equations useful to design the FP system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","FP bearing; LHS method; Seismic reliability; Structural performance","Christopoulos, C., Filiatrault, A., (2006) Principles of passive supplemental damping and seismic isolation, , IUSS Press, Pavia, Italy; Zayas, V.A., Low, S.S., Mahin, S.A., A simple pendulum technique for achieving seismic isolation (1990) Earthquake Spectra, 6, pp. 317-333; Almazàn, J.L., De la Llera, J.C., Physical model for dynamic analysis of structures with FPS isolators (2003) Earthquake Eng Struct Dyn, 32, pp. 1157-1184; Jangid, R.S., Optimum frictional elements in sliding isolation systems (2000) Comput Struct, 76, pp. 651-661; Ayyub, B.M., McCuen, R.H., (2002) Probability, statistics, and reliability for engineers, , CRC Press, NY; Lin, Y.K., Cai, G.Q., (1995) Probabilistic structural dynamics-advanced theory and applications, , McGraw-Hill, NY; Chen, J., Liu, W., Peng, Y., Li, J., Stochastic seismic response and reliability analysis of base-isolated structures (2007) J Earthquake Eng, 11, pp. 903-924; Fan, F.G., Ahmadi, G., Random response analysis of frictional base isolation system (1990) J Eng Mech, 116 (9), pp. 1881-1901; Su, L., Ahmadi, G., Response of frictional base isolation systems to horizontal-vertical random earthquake excitations (1988) Prob Eng Mech, 3 (1), pp. 12-21; Alhan, C., Gavin, H.P., Reliability of base isolation for the protection of critical equipment from earthquake hazards (2005) Eng Struct, 27, pp. 1435-1449; Zou, X.K., Wang, Q., Li, G., Chan, C.M., Integrated reliability-based seismic drift design optimization of base-isolated concrete buildings (2010) J Struct Eng, 136, pp. 1282-1295; Mishra, S.K., Roy, B.K., Chakraborty, S., Reliability-based-design-optimization of base isolated buildings considering stochastic system parameters subjected to random earthquakes (2013) Int J Mech Sci, 75, pp. 123-133; Zhao, C., Chen, J., Numerical simulation and investigation of the base isolated NPPC building under three-directional seismic loading (2013) Nucl Eng Des, 265, pp. 484-496; Norme tecniche per le costruzioni., , Gazzetta Ufficiale del 04.02.08, DM 14.01.08, Ministero delle Infrastructure; Mokha, A., Constantinou, M.C., Reinhorn, A.M., Teflon bearings in base isolation.

Structures are designed for load combinations including live, dead, wind, earthquake, and other loads. Particularly for earthquake loads, different design approaches are used with the general understanding that for sites with high seismicity, structures need to be ductile and in turn may be designed for relatively smaller base shear. In this paper the effects of seismic design and structural integrity requirements on progressive collapse resistance of reinforced concrete frame structures is evaluated. The relative importance of ductility (deformation) capacity and strength is discussed for response of structures subjected to severe seismic ground motions and to loss of a column. The effects of span length on a building's response after column removal are discussed. It is demonstrated that for buildings with shorter spans at sites with low to medium seismic severity, designing for higher seismicity does not necessarily lead to a better performance and smaller vertical displacement following loss of an exterior column. Effects of other parameters, such as the joist torsional stiffness and concrete tensile strength are also discussed. An approximate method using equivalent single degree of freedom systems is presented for evaluating maximum displacement response of structures after element failure, which estimated the building responses studied in this paper with a maximum error of 13%. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Approximate method; Integrity requirements; Progressive collapse; RC structures; Reinforced concrete; Seismic design; Torsional stiffness","(2011) Building code requirement for structural concrete, , American Concrete Institute, MI; Allen, D.E., Schriever, W.R., (1972) Progressive collapse, abnormal loads, and building codes, , Division of Building Research, National Research Council; Minimum design loads for buildings and other structures (2010), Structural Engineering Institute - American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, VABaldridge, S.M., Humay, F.K., Preventing progressive collapse in concrete buildings (2003) Concr Int, 25 (11), pp. 73-79; Bazan, M., Response of reinforced concrete elements and structures following loss of load bearing elements (2008), PhD dissertation, Northeastern University, Boston, MABreen, J.E., (1975) Research workshop on progressive collapse of building structures held at the University of Texas at Austin, , National Bureau of Standards, Washington, DC; Corley, W.G., Lesson learned on improving resistance of buildings to terrorist attacks (2004) J Perform Constr Facilit, ASCE, 18 (2), pp. 68-78; Dhakal, R.P., Fenwick, R.C., Detailing of plastic hinges in seismic design of concrete structures (2008) Struct J, ACI, 105 (6), pp. 740-749; Design of building to resist progressive collapse, unified facility criteria, UFC 4-023-03 (2013), U.S. Department of Defense, Washington, DCEllingwood, B., Leyendecker, E.V., Approaches for design against progressive collapse (1978) J Struct Div, ASCE, 104 (ST3), pp. 413-423; Felippa, C.A., (2000) A systematic approach to the element-independent corotational dynamics of finite elements, , Center for Aerospace Structures, College of Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO; Progressive collapse analysis and design guidelines for new federal office buildings and major modernization projects (2003), U.S. General Service Administration, Washington, DCAlternate path analysis & design guidelines for progressive collapse resistance (2013), U.S. General Service Administration, Washington, DCHayes, J.R., Woodson, S.C., Pekelnicky, R.G., Poland, C.D., Corley, W.G., Sozen, M., Can strengthening for earthquake improve blast and progressive collapse resistance?

Reynosa Tamaulipas, México, D.F., Mexico","A parametric study was devoted to evaluate, using static nonlinear analyses (pushover), global seismic design parameters for low to medium rise regular reinforced concrete moment-resisting braced frames (RC-MRBFs) with hysteretic energy dissipation devices mounted on chevron steel bracing. Frame models with range from five to twenty five stories were designed using different elastic stiffness ratios between the moment frame system and the whole structure (frame-bracing-hysteretic device system). Also, different elastic stiffness balances between the hysteretic device and the supporting braces were considered. Different post to pre yielding stiffness ratios for the hysteretic devices were considered. Two angles of inclination of the chevron braces with respect to the horizontal axis were considered, taking into account typical story heights and bay widths used in Mexican practice. From the results obtained in this study, stiffness balances are defined to achieve a suitable mechanism where the hysteretic devices yield first and develop their maximum local displacement ductility, whereas in the moment frame incipient yielding is only formed at the beam ends. Finally, additional comments are made with respect to: (a) relations between global ductility capacity and local displacement ductility capacity for the hysteretic devices for a given combination of the studied stiffness parameters and angles of inclination, (b) story drifts at yielding and their relation with the selected elastic stiffness ratio between the moment frame system and the whole structure and, (c) overstrength factors for design purposes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Deformation capacity; Design drifts; Ductility demands; Energy dissipation; Metallic fuses; Overstrength; Seismic response factors; Stiffness balances","Tena-Colunga, A., State of the art and state of the practice for energy dissipation and seismic isolation of structures in Mexico (2007), In: Proceedings, 10th world conference on seismic isolation, energy dissipation and active vibration control of structures, Istanbul, Turkey, CD-ROM, MayNormas Técnicas Complementarias para Diseño por Sismo , p. 2004. , Gaceta Oficial del Distrito Federal, Tomo II, No. 103-BIS, October; [in Spanish]Manual de diseño de obras civiles (2008), Diseño por sismo, Comisión Federal de Electricidad, México, November; 2009 [in Spanish]Tena-Colunga, A., Mena-Hernández, U., Pérez-Rocha, L.E., Avilés, J., Ordaz, M., Vilar, J.I., Updated seismic design guidelines for buildings of a model code of Mexico (2009) Earthquake Spectra, 25 (4), pp. 869-898; Minimum design loads for buildings and other structures (2010), ASCE Standard ASCE/SEI 7-10, American Society of Civil EngineersWu, J., Hanson, R.E., Inelastic response of structures with high damping subjected to earthquakes (1987), Report UMCE 87-9.

This is mainly because their behaviour during earthquake is very critical. Hence, in the present study, an experimental programme was undertaken by considering three types of beam-column connections with some specific deficiencies. For each type, three different sizes of specimens were considered to evaluate the existence of size effect in beam-column connections. Cyclic load was applied using servo hydraulic dynamic actuators with displacement-controlled load of frequency of 0.025. Hz. Amplitudes of the displacement histories were scaled down for two-third and one-third models. It was observed that the size effect became more pronounced with the increase in the brittleness of the specimens. To compare the energy dissipation of specimens having different sizes of beam-column joints, a parameter energy dissipation per unit volume of joint (e<inf>N</inf>) was introduced. This parameter was correlated with different drift angles for different sizes of the specimen and accordingly variation of e<inf>N</inf> with drift angle for different sizes of specimens were plotted. The variation of stress with relative deflection was also correlated with size of the specimens. It was observed that energy dissipation of specimens per unit volume as well as the variation of stress with relative deflection indicated the existence of size effect. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Beam-column connection; Deficient specimen; Dynamic load; Size effect","Abdel-Fattah, B., Wight, J.K., Study of moving beam plastic hinging zones for earthquake-resistant design of reinforced concrete buildings (1987) ACI Struct J, 84 (1), pp. 31-39; Barbhuiya, S., Effects of fly ash and dolomite powder on the properties of self-compacting concrete (2011) Constr Build Mater, 25 (8), pp. 3301-3305; Bažant, Z.P., Planas, J., (1998) Fracture and size effect in concrete and other quasibrittle materials, , CRC Press, N.Y; Belgin, C.M., Sener, S., Size effect on failure of over reinforced concrete beams (2008) Eng Fract Mech, 75, pp. 2308-2319; Chutarat, N., Aboutaha, R.S., Cyclic response of exterior reinforced Concrete beam-column joints reinforced with headed bars-experimental investigation (2003) ACI Struct J, 100 (2), pp. 259-264; Corinaldesi, V., Letelier, V., Moriconi, G., Behaviour of beam-column joints made of recycled-aggregate concrete under cyclic loading (2011) Constr Build Mater, 25 (4), pp. 1877-1882; Durrani, A.J., Wight, J.K., Behaviour of interior beam-to-column connections under earthquake-type loading (1985) ACI J Proc, 82 (3), pp. 343-349; Ha, G.J., Cho, C.G., Kamg, H.W., Feo, L., Seismic improvement of RC beam-column joints using hexagonal CFRP bars combined with CFRP sheets (2013) Compos Struct, 95, pp. 464-470; Joshi, M.K., Murty, C.V.R., Jaisingh, M.P., Cyclic behaviour of precast RC connections (2005) Indian Concr J, 79 (11), pp. 43-50; Koc, V., Sener, S., Size effect in normal- and high-strength concrete with different notches under the axial load (2009) J Mater Civil Eng, ASCE, 21 (9), pp. 433-445; Letelier, V., Moriconi, G., The influence of recycled concrete aggregates on the behavior of beam-column joints under cyclic loading (2014) Eng Struct, 60, pp. 148-154; Metelli, G., messali, F., Beschi, C., Riva, P., A model for beam-column corner joints of exiting RC frame subjected to cyclic loading' (2015) Eng Struct, 89, pp. 79-92; Nehdi, M., Alam, M.S., Youssed, M.A., Development of corrosion-free concrete beam-column joint with adequate seismic energy dissipation (2010) Eng Struct, 32 (9), pp. 2518-2528; Nie, J., Bai, Y., Cai, C.S., New connection system for confined concrete columns and beams.

Once archaeological sites are exposed after being buried for centuries, they are subjected to natural hazards, which should be studied with up-to-date techniques. Moreover, conservation works are primarily focused on aesthetic aspects or on solving localized problems. In earthquake-prone areas, it is of extreme importance to carry out structural analysis studies for assessing the actual behaviour of archaeological constructions, and for proposing adequate intervention measures. This paper presents an extensive study on structural behaviour of archaeological building remains in Peru, based on in-situ non-destructive testing as well as on numerical approaches. The case of the Chokepukio Archaeological Site is presented, which was built between 1000 and 1450 AD in the Pre-Columbian era, with a mixed masonry of stone units and earthen mortar. The paper begins with a comprehensive description of the historical, architectural and structural aspects of the archaeological site. The possibility of applying operational modal analysis tests is then explored with reference to a representative wall of Chokepukio. The results of the experimental field campaign are used to develop calibrated finite element models of the wall, and to indirectly estimate mechanical characteristics of the masonry. Basing on the investigations performed, potential failure mechanisms are identified for the wall and validated by pushover analysis. Finally, the mechanisms are evaluated through kinematic limit analysis, to proceed with the seismic assessment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Archaeological building remains; Finite element modelling; Kinematic analysis; Model calibration; Operational modal analysis; Pushover analysis; Stone masonry","Lourenço, P.B., Recommendations for restoration of ancient buildings and the survival of a masonry chimney (2006) Constr Build Mater, 20 (4), pp. 239-251; Roca, P., Cervera, M., Gariup, G., Pelà, L., Structural analysis of masonry historical constructions: classical and advanced approaches (2010) Arch Comput Methods Eng, 17 (3), pp. 299-325; Lourenço, P.B., Computations on historic masonry structures (2002) Prog Struct Mat Eng, 4 (3), pp. 301-319; Chellini, G., Nardini, L., Pucci, B., Salvatore, W., Tognaccini, R., Evaluation of seismic vulnerability of Santa Maria del Mar in Barcelona by an integrated approach based on terrestrial laser scanner and finite element modelling (2014) Int J Archit Heritage, 8 (6), pp. 795-819; de Matteis, G., Mazzolani, F.M., The Fossanova Church: seismic vulnerability assessment by numeric and physical testing (2010) Int J Archit Heritage, 4 (3), pp. 222-245; Ceroni, F., Pecce, M., Voto, S., Manfredi, G., Historical, architectural, and structural assessment of the bell tower of Santa Maria del Carmine (2009) Int J Archit Heritage, 3 (3), pp. 169-194; Casarin, F., Modena, C., Seismic assessment of complex historical buildings: application to Reggio Emilia Cathedral, Italy (2008) Int J Archit Heritage, 2 (3), pp. 304-327; Lourenço, P.B., Trujillo, A., Mendes, N., Ramos, L.F., Seismic performance of the St. George of the Latins church: lessons learned from studying masonry ruins (2012) Eng Struct, 40, pp. 501-518; Chácara, C., Zvietcovich, F., Briceño, C., Marques, R., Perucchio, R., Castañeda, B., On-site investigation and numerical analysis for structural assessment of the archaeological complex of Huaca de la Luna (2014) Proceedings of the SAHC2014: 9th international conference on structural analysis of historical constructions, , Mexico City; [CD-ROM]; Marques, R., Pereira, J.M., Lourenço, P.B., Parker, W., Uno, M., Study of the seismic behavior of the ""Old Municipal Chambers"" building in Christchurch, New Zealand (2013) J Earthquake Eng, 17 (3), pp. 350-377; Oliveira, D.V., Grecchi, G., McCall, A., Noh, J., Speer, E., Tohidi, M., Seismic analysis of the Roman Temple of Évora, Portugal (2008) Proceedings of the 14th world conference on earthquake engineering, , Beijing; [CD-ROM]; McEwan, G., Gibaja, A., Chatfield, M., Monumental architecture of late intermediate period of Cuzco: continuities of ritual reciprocity and statecraft between the middle and late horizons (2005) Boletín de Arqueología PUCP, 9, pp. 257-280. , [in Spanish]; Magalhães, F., Cunha, A., Explaining operational modal analysis with data from an arch bridge (2011) Mech Syst Signal Process, 25 (5), pp. 1431-1450; Rainieri, C., Fabbrocino, G., (2014) Operational modal analysis of civil engineering structures: an introduction and guide for applications, , Springer, Berlin; Rainieri, C., Fabbrocino, G., Verderame, G.M., Non-destructive characterization and dynamic identification of a modern heritage building for serviceability seismic analyses (2013) NDT&E Int, 60, pp. 17-31; Caprili, S., Nardini, L., Salvatore, W., Evaluation of seismic vulnerability of a complex RC existing building by linear and nonlinear modeling approaches (2012) Bull Earthq Eng, 10 (3), pp. 913-954; Alaboz, M., Ramos, L.F., Aguilar, R., Dynamic identification and modal updating of S.

Based on their geomorphology and physical settings, the canyons and channels were classified into four categories according to their feeding sources (ancient or recent): glacially-fed, river-fed, longshore drift-fed and sediment-starved systems. Their activity was interpreted based on geomorphological characteristics such as the presence of bedforms related to gravity flows, backscatter intensity, axial incision and the presence of rapidly deposited layers in surficial sediments. River-fed deltas were interpreted as inactive, mainly because suspended sediment concentrations at river mouths are low, preventing the generation of hyperpycnal currents or delta-lip failures related to high sediment supply. Longshore drift-fed canyons, present where the coastal shelf narrows, were found to be episodically active probably due to earthquakes or extreme storm events. Unlike other longshore drift-fed canyons observed elsewhere in the world, they are active infrequently because of the modern low rates of sediment supply to their heads. The most active canyons are the sediment-starved type and were observed near Pointe-des-Monts. Their activity is probably due to slope failures and to the presence of strong hydrodynamic processes. Therefore, sediment supply is not the main mechanism responsible for modern canyon and channel activity in the LSLE. However, sediment supply has been an important factor during the formation of the submarine channels and canyons. Their quasi-exclusive occurrence on the Québec North Shore is attributed to its larger watershed and important sedimentary delivery during deglaciation. The Québec North Shore watershed is 20 times greater than the Québec South Shore watershed, which favored the transport of greater volumes of sediment during the early-Holocene. Moreover, the slope proximity to the shore led to the formation of longshore-drift fed systems on the North Shore when sediment supplied to rivers were transferred on a narrow shelf. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Gravity flows; Seabed morphology; Sedimentary processes; St. Lawrence Estuary; Submarine canyons","Armitage, D.A., Piper, D.J.W., McGee, D.T., Morris, W.R., Turbidite deposition on the glacially influenced, canyon-dominated Southwest Grand Banks Slope, Canada (2010) Sedimentology, 57, pp. 1387-1408; Ashley, G.M., Classification of large-scale subaqueous bedforms: a new look at an old problem (1990) J.

While many seismic slope stability analysis methods exist with varying degrees of complexity, details of interactions between seismic waves and incipient landslides are not well understood and rarely incorporated, in particular for deep-seated slope instabilities. We present a series of 2D distinct-element numerical models aimed at clarifying interactions between earthquakes and large rock slope instabilities. The study has two main goals: 1) to explore the role of amplification in enhancing co-seismic slope deformation - a relationship widely discussed in literature but rarely tested quantitatively; and 2) to compare our numerical results with the well-established Newmark-method, which is commonly used in seismic slope stability analysis. We focus on three amplification phenomena: 1) geometric (topographic) amplification, 2) amplification related to material contrasts, and 3) amplification related to compliant fractures. Slope height, topography, seismic velocity contrasts, and internal strength and damage history were varied systematically in a series of models with a relatively simple, scalable geometry. For each model, we compute the spatial amplification patterns and displacement induced by real earthquake ground motions. We find that material contrasts and internal fracturing create both the largest amplification factors and induced displacements, while the effect of geometry is comparably small. Newmark-type sliding block methods underestimate displacements by not accounting for material contrasts and internal fracturing within the landslide body - both common phenomena in deep-seated slope instabilities. Although larger amplification factors tend to be associated with greater displacements, we did not identify a clear link between ground motion frequency content, spectral amplification, and induced displacement. Nevertheless, observation of amplification patterns can play an important role in seismic slope stability analyses, as: 1) strong amplification (related to material contrasts or compliant fractures) is an indicator of potentially large co-seismic displacements; and 2) amplification patterns can be used to constrain geological and numerical models used for seismic stability analysis. The complexity of wave-slope interactions, as well as the potential to severely underestimate hazard using Newmark-type methods, motivates use of rigorous numerical modeling for quantitative seismic hazard and risk assessment of large landslides. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Newmark method; Seismic landslide hazard; Spectral amplification; Topographic amplification","Allstadt, K., Vidale, J.E., Frankel, A.D., A scenario study of seismically induced landsliding in Seattle using broadband synthetic seismograms (2013) Bull.

We propose a new mechanical model that involves constant release of shear strain accumulated between the crust and mantle lithosphere caused by differential volume changes during phase transformations as a slab sinks. This generates increasing down-dip compression inside the slab with depth, consistent with the global distribution of deep earthquake focal mechanisms. Using experimentally calibrated slab rheology, we show that the estimated distribution of slab internal stress agrees well with the depth-frequency relationship of deep earthquakes in both cold and warm slabs, with the peak in seismicity at ~600 km depth corresponding to an induced stress maximum. This mechanism of residual stress within a cold slab also provides a solution to deep earthquakes occurring beneath former subduction zones such as western Tonga and Spain. We further suggest that this model may reconcile existing geodynamic paradoxes concerning the absolute strength of slabs, discrepancies on mantle rock strength between laboratory and geophysical inversions, as well as the competition between earthquake-generating stresses and slab-pull forces. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Differential volume reduction; Down-dip compression; Focal mechanism; Outboard earthquakes; Phase transformation; Slab internal stress","Alisic, L., Gurnis, M., Stadler, G., Burstedde, C., Wilcox, L.C., Ghattas, O., Slab stress and strain rate as constraints on global mantle flow (2010) Geophys.

However, it is difficult to obtain a comprehensive rupture pattern at depth when a source model is only constrained by geodetic surface deformation. In this study, a joint inversion approach incorporating stress changes and GPS surface displacements is explored and applied to characterize the fault slip of the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, China. The earthquake data for the 20-year period before the main quake, which are collected from the background seismicity catalogues, and one month of aftershock data are statistically analysed to determine the fault stress changes based on the Dieterich model. The coseismic surface deformation measurements from 158 GPS surveying sites are jointly used to constrain the solution. Our preferred rupture model reveals four high-slip concentrations on the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault and one on the subparallel PengGuan fault. The spatial distribution suggests that the coseismic slip occurs not only above the hypocentre but also with a significant thrusting motion, with a mean slip of 8.5. m and a maximum of 9.7. m at a depth of 10-16. km. A significant high-slip concentration is found for the first time in this study. The coseismic faulting extends toward ~16. km southwest of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault and has a dextral strike-slip with a mean displacement of 4.8. m at a depth of 7-19. km. The joint inversion model misfits (GPS: 1.7. cm, stress change: 0.02. MPa) exhibit a good compatibility between the two types of datasets. The derived slip model, which has an improved resolution at depth, explains 98% of the coseismic surface displacements and 93% of the fault stress changes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Deep coseismic slip; GPS displacements; Joint inversion; Stress change; Wenchuan earthquake","Burchfiel, B.C., Royden, L.H., Hilst, R.D., Hager, B.H., Chen, Z., King, R.W., Li, C., Kirby, E., A geological and geophysical context for the Wenchuan earthquake of 12 May 2008, Sichuan, People's Republic of China (2008) Geol.

This earthquake was felt up to 300km away from the epicenter, and was the biggest event ever detected in Central Brazil Seismic Zone. Despite the difficulty of associating earthquakes in Stable Continental Interior with geological structures, this event is possibly related to the reactivation of a geological fault of the continental-scale Transbrasiliano Lineament (TBL): the aftershock activity observed with an 8-station seismic network, indicates a NW dipping, SW-NE trending reverse fault, parallel to the TBL. The P axis is NW-SE oriented, consistent with expected stress direction in the region. Cross correlation technique was used to synchronize the weak P- and S- wave phases of some of the aftershocks, recorded at regional stations, with the corresponding arrivals of the main shock producing a consistent set of relative arrival times. The use of regional station corrections allowed the mainshock to be located with uncertainties small enough to qualify for a GT5 event, which will help to constrain 3D velocity models in South America. We found that the aftershocks were distributed around a circular area about 1.5-2.0km across, with no events in the middle. This is interpreted as the mainshock rupture completely releasing all stresses. The rupture area and the mainshock moment correspond to a stress-drop of about 2MPa. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Ground-truth (GT) events; Mara rosa earthquake; Moment-tensor; Relative locations; Transbrasiliano lineament; Waveform inversion","Agurto-Detzel, H., Assumpção, M., Ciardelli, C., Albuquerque, D.F., Barros, L.V., França, G.S.L., The 2012-2013 Montes Claros earthquake series in the São Francisco Craton, Brazil: new evidence for non-uniform intraplate stresses in mid-plate South America (2014) Geophys.

This paper provides quantification of the attributes of the uplifted area, determining the pre-quake extent of the intertidal habitats, and attempting to reconstruct some intertidal community assemblages based on post-quake artefacts. We determined the total extent of the intertidal area severely affected by the ground uplift amounting to >400ha, comprised of mangroves (42 ha; 10%), seagrass beds (135 ha; 32%), reef slope corals (148; 35%), and intertidal sandflats, mudflats and rocky habitats (altogether, 94 ha; 22%). This impact may be grossly translated to a US$ 4.4 million of economic loss annually. Our ground elevation- and transect truthing surveys of habitat artefacts generally validated our areal approximations. Also, across these transects, we confirmed speciose pre-quake assemblage of important invertebrates and other taxa occurring in these intertidal areas. In strong contrast to the exposed seagrass beds and coral areas, which were already all dried-up and died, most mangroves were still surviving after 8 months post uplift (i.e., practically no more tidal inundation since Oct 2013), albeit now in strong competition against the aggressive colonization of terrestrial plants. We recommend the close monitoring of the fate of the surviving mangroves and the likely transformation of such into completely terrestrial ecosystems. We likewise recommend the close monitoring of the coastal fisheries as may be linked to such post-quake loss of intertidal habitats, and carefully design management measures to mitigate such impact. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","7.2M<inf>w</inf> Bohol earthquake; Beach forest expansion; Massive loss of intertidal habitats; Post-quake coastal management actions","Berg, C.J., Alatalo, P., Mariculture potential of shallow-water Bahamian bivalves (1982) J.World Maric.

However, they incorrectly considered the maximum vertical co-seismic displacement as the rigid geo-center motion (i.e., they did not separate the rigid shift and elastic deformation). In this paper, we correct Sun and Dong (2014) by using a new approach. We now define the geo-center motion as a shift of the center of figure of the Earth relative to the center of mass of the Earth. Furthermore, we derive new formulas to compute the co-seismic geo-center and inner core's center movements caused by huge earthquakes. The 2004 Sumatra earthquake and the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake changed the geo-center by 1-4. mm and about 2. mm, respectively, and caused the inner core's center to displace by about 0.05. mm and 0.025. mm, respectively. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Center of figure of the Earth; Center of mass of the Earth; Co-seismic geo-center movement; Dislocation theory","Blewitt, G., Self-consistency in reference frames, geocenter definition, and surface loading of the solid Earth (2003) Journal of Geophysical Research, 108 (B2); Chao, B.F., Gross, R.S., Changes in the Earth's rotation and low-degree gravitational field induced by earthquakes (1987) Geophysical Journal Royal Astronomical Society, 91, pp. 569-596; Dong, D.J., Dickey, O., Chao, Y., Cheng, M.K., Geocenter variations caused by atmosphere, ocean and surface groundwater (1997) Geophysical Research Letters, 24 (15), pp. 1867-1870; Dziewonski, A.M., Anderson, D.L., Preliminary reference earth model (1981) Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors, 25, pp. 297-356; Greff-Lefftz, M., Legros, H., Some remarks about the degree one deformations of the Earth (1997) Geophysical Journal International, 131, pp. 699-723; Greff-Lefftz, M., Legros, H., Fluid core dynamics and degree-one deformations: Slichter mode and geocenter motions (2007) Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors, 161, pp. 150-160; Okubo, S., Reciprocity theorem to compute the static deformation due to a point dislocation buried in a spherically symmetric earth (1993) Geophysical Journal International, 115, pp. 921-928; Okubo, S., Endo, T., Static spheroidal deformation of degree 1-consistencyrelation, stress solution and partials (1986) Geophysical Journal Royal Astronomical Society, 86, pp. 91-102; Sun, H.P., Xu, J.Q., Ducarme, B., Detection of the translational oscillations of the Earth's solid inner core based on the international superconducting gravimeter observations (2004) Chinese Science Bulletin, 49 (11), pp. 1165-1176; Sun, W., (1992) Potential and gravity changes raised by dislocations in spherically symmetric earth models, , The University of Tokyo, Japan, PhD Thesis; Sun, W., Okubo, S., Surface potential and gravity changes due to internal dislocations in a spherical Earth, II: application to a finite fault (1998) Geophysical Journal International, 132, pp. 79-88; Sun, W., Okubo, S., Vaníček, P., Global displacements caused by point dislocations in a realistic Earth model (1996) Journal of Geophysical Research, 101 (B4), pp. 8561-8577; Sun, W., Dong, J., Geo-center movement caused by huge earthquakes (2014) Journal of Geodynamics, 76, pp. 1-7; Sun, W., Okubo, S., Surface potential and gravity changes due to internal dislocations in a spherical earth -I.

A building identification method and a floor plan generation method are proposed in this study. These methods facilitate the automatic generation of 3D-GIS data of buildings, using the widely available 3D urban polygonal model and 2D-GIS data, to achieve the integrated earthquake simulation (IES)-based urban seismic simulation. In addition, a high-fidelity urban earthquake disaster scenario is generated based on the 3D urban polygonal model, the seismic simulation results from IES, and the proposed remeshing and displacement interpolation techniques, which is significantly more realistic than the existing 2.5D visualization method.

Three types of reinforced concrete buildings with 3, 7 and 15 stories, respectively representative of short, medium and long period ranges, are considered. Dissipators are placed on steel diagonal braces at all the floors; their sliding threshold (or yielding) forces are taken as 100% of those generated by the equivalent static lateral forces recommended by EC8 for a ductile moment resisting frame. The input consists of six recorded earthquakes, 3 representatives of near-field earthquakes and 3 representatives of far-field earthquakes. Each input is considered once from the bedrock and once filtered by a common ground with several layers of different thicknesses. The responses of the buildings are discussed and compared emphasizing the filtering effects produced by the ground. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy dissipaters; Local soil; Near-field ground motion; Parametric assessment; Passive control","Markušić, S., Herak, M., Herak, D., Ivančić, I., Peak horizontal-to-vertical acceleration ratio and local amplification of strong ground motion (2002) Stud Geophys Geod, 46 (1), pp. 83-92; Idriss, I.M., Sun, J.L., (1992) SHAKE 91.

However, the researchers focused on seismic analyses of reinforced concrete containment (RCC) buildings under only mainshocks. The aim of this paper is to thoroughly investigate the dynamic responses of a RCC building under mainshock-aftershock seismic sequences. For that purpose, 10 as-recorded mainshock-aftershock seismic sequences with two horizontal components are considered in this study, and a typical three-dimensional RCC model subjected to the selected as-recorded seismic sequences is established. Peak ground accelerations (PGAs) of mainshocks equal to 0.3. g (safe shutdown earthquake load-SSE load) are considered in this paper. The results indicate that aftershocks have a significant effect on the responses of the RCC in terms of maximum top accelerations, maximum top displacements and accumulated damage. Furthermore, in order to preserve the RCC from large damage under repeated earthquakes, local damage and global damage indices are suggested as limitations under only mainshocks. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Mainshock-aftershock; Reinforced concrete containment building; Seismic analyses","Elnashai, A.S., Di Sarno, L., (2008) Fundamentals of earthquake engineering, , Wiley, Chichester, UK; (2008), http://www.csndmc.ac.cn/newweb/, AvailableatAmadio, C., Fragiacomo, M., Rajgelj, S., The effects of repeated earthquake ground motions on the non-linear response of SDOF systems (2003) Earthq Eng Struct Dyn, 32 (2), pp. 291-308; Das, S., Gupta, V.K., Srimahavishnu, V., Damage-based design with no repairs for multiple events and its sensitivity to seismicity model (2007) Earthq Eng Struct Dyn, 36 (3), pp. 307-325; Di Sarno, L., Effects of multiple earthquakes on inelastic structural response (2013) Eng Struct, 56 (11), pp. 673-681; Goda, K., Taylor, C.A., Effects of aftershocks on peak ductility demand due to strong ground motion records from shallow crustal earthquakes (2012) Earthq Eng Struct Dyn, 41 (15), pp. 2311-2330; Goda, K., Nonlinear response potential of mainshock-aftershock sequences from Japanese earthquakes (2012) Bull Seismol Soc Am, 102 (5), pp. 2139-2156; Hatzigeorgiou, G.D., Beskos, D.E., Inelastic displacement ratios for SDOF structures subjected to repeated earthquakes (2009) Eng Struct, 31 (11), pp. 2744-2755; Hatzigeorgiou, G.D., Behavior factors for nonlinear structures subjected to multiple near-fault earthquakes (2010) Comput Struct, 88 (5-6), pp. 309-321; Hatzigeorgiou, G.D., Ductility demand spectra for multiple near-and far-fault earthquakes (2010) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 30 (4), pp. 170-183; Moustafa, A., Takewaki, I., Response of nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom structures to random acceleration sequences (2011) Eng Struct, 33 (4), pp. 1251-1258; Sunasaka, Y., Kiremidjian, A.S., Toki, K., Strength demand spectra with uniform damage level in lifetime of structure (2002) J Struct Eng, 48 A, pp. 523-530; Zhai, C.H., Wen, W.P., Chen, Z.Q., Li, S., Xie, L.L., Damage spectra for the mainshock-aftershock sequence-type ground motions (2013) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 45, pp. 1-12; Zhai, C.H., Wen, W.P., Li, S., Chen, Z., Xie, L.L., The damage investigation of inelastic SDOF structure under the mainshock-aftershock sequence-type ground motions (2014) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 59, pp. 30-41; Alliard, P., Leger, P., Earthquake safety evaluation of gravity dams considering aftershocks and reduced drainage efficiency (2008) J Eng Mech, 134 (1), pp. 12-22; Fragiacomo, M., Amadio, C., Macorini, L., Seismic response of steel frames under repeated earthquake ground motions (2004) Eng Struct, 26 (13), pp. 2021-2035; Faisal, A., Majid, T.A., Hatzigeorgiou, G.D., Investigation of story ductility demands of inelastic concrete frames subjected to repeated earthquakes (2013) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 44, pp. 42-53; Lee, K., Foutch, D.A., Performance evaluation of damaged steel frame buildings subjected to seismic loads (2001) J Struct Eng, 130 (4), pp. 588-599; Loulelis, D., Hatzigeorgiou, G.D., Beskos, D.E., Moment resisting steel frames under repeated earthquakes (2012) Earthq Struct, 3 (3), pp. 231-248; Ruiz-Garcia, J., Negrete-Manriquez, J.C., Evaluation of drift demands in existing steel frames under as-recorded far-field and near-fault mainshock-aftershock seismic sequences (2011) Eng Struct, 33 (2), pp. 621-634; Hatzigeorgiou, G.D., Liolios, A.A., Nonlinear behavior of RC frames under repeated strong ground motions (2010) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 30 (10), pp. 1010-1025; Raghunandan, M., Liel, A.B., Luco, N., Aftershock collapse vulnerability assessment of reinforced concrete frame structures (2015) Earthq Eng Struct Dyn, 44 (3), pp. 419-439; Buckle, I.G., Kelly, T.E., Jones, L.R., Basic concepts of seismic isolation and their application to nuclear structures (1987) Seismic engineering recent advances in design, analysis, testing and qualification methods.

In addition, the column panel zone can be proportioned to participate in energy dissipation. AISC360, Eurocode 3, and FEMA-355D specifications have different philosophies for the design of panel zones which lead to different amounts of deformation demands. This paper presents a numerical study undertaken to quantify the deformation demands in panel zones proportioned according to different specifications. Pursuant to this goal, the panel zone design requirements of three specifications were compared first to identify differences and similarities. A parametric study was conducted by considering the beam depth, axial load level on columns, thickness of panel zone, and seismic hazard as the prime variables. Archetypes were analyzed by employing three-dimensional explicit nonlinear finite element time history analyses. The analysis results revealed that designs according to AISC360 and Eurocode 3 resulted in significant amounts of yielding of the panel zone while the designs according to FEMA 355D resulted in minimal amount of yielding. The panel zone deformation demands were quantified and an equation used to estimate the deformation levels was developed herein. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Authors proposed the concept and method for evaluating core damage frequency (CDF) considering failure correlation at the multi units and sites. Based on the above method, one of authors developed the procedure for evaluating the failure correlation coefficient and response correlation coefficient between the multi components under the strong seismic motion. These method and failure correlation coefficients were applied to two different BWR units and their CDF was evaluated by seismic probabilistic risk assessment technology.

However, the mechanisms of surface uplift are still controversial. In this paper, we estimate the crustal structure and deformation under the LMS and its surroundings by analyzing a large amount of receiver function data recorded by regional seismic networks of the China Earthquake Administration. We apply a comprehensive splitting measurement technique on Ps conversion phase at the Moho (Moho Ps splitting) to calculate crustal anisotropy from azimuthal variations of receiver functions. Our results show that most of the seismic stations beneath the LMS area exhibit significant seismic anisotropy with the splitting time of 0.22-0.94. s and a fast polarization direction of NW-SE, while less or even no crustal anisotropy has been observed under the Sichuan Basin. Comparing the fast polarization directions of Moho Ps splitting with the indicators of lithospheric deformation (such as shear wave splitting, absolute plate motion, and global positioning system) imply a consistent tendency of deformation between the lower crust and upper mantle, but decoupling deformation in the crust beneath the LMS area. We further compare Moho Ps splitting time to that estimated from previous SKS splitting, indicating that crustal anisotropy is an important source of the SKS splitting time in this study area. In addition, a thick crust (>50. km) with high Vp/. Vs values (1.74-1.86) is also observed using the H-κ stacking method. These seismic observations are consistent with the scenario that the LMS area has been built by the lower crustal flow. Combined with the seismic reflection/refraction profile and geology studies, we further suggest that the lower crustal flow may extrude upward into the upper crust along the steeply dipping strike faults under the LMS area, resulting in the surface uplift of the LMS. © 2015.","Crustal seismic anisotropy; Longmenshan region; Lower crust flow; Upward extrusion","Ammon, C.J., The isolation of receiver effect from teleseismic p waveforms (1991) Bull.

The simple deterministic models described here suggest that the time span for water movement into such faults within a distance of 3000. m is likely to be of the order of months and that the hydrostatic pressure buildup within the filled cracks is likely to significantly increase the risk of fault slip. These results appear to be consistent with available observations as documented by Goldbach [20]. The simple models predict a linear decrease in the effective coefficient of friction of the water filled fault with water depth with a reduction of up to 30% possible. Furthermore, and importantly, slip is predicted to occur along joints and faults not previously prone to slip because of their unfavored orientation. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Abandoned mines; Fault slip; Seismicity; Water movement in joints","Gibowicz, S.J., Lasocki, S., Seismicity induced by mining. ten years later (2000) Adv Geophys, 44, pp. 39-167; Durrheim, R.J., Mitigating the risk of rockbursts in the deep hard rock mines of South Africa: 100 years of research.

We use a set of equations coupling vibrations in buildings to motion under the ground. These equations were previously studied exclusively in the case of a finite set of identical, equally spaced, buildings. These two restrictions are lifted in this paper. We may now simulate geometries involving infinitely many buildings as long as an initial pattern of buildings is repeated. Our new method using periodic domains and periodic Green's functions yields much faster computations. This is the main reason why we are now able to study systems of buildings of variable height, mass, and rigidity. We show how solving for the wavenumber in a non-linear equation involving the integral of a function solution to an adequate integral equation, we are able to find resonant frequencies coupling seismic waves and vibrating tall buildings. Interestingly, in the case of non-identical buildings, our simulations indicate that the response to this coupling phenomenon may differ drastically from one building to another. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","City effect; Integral equations; Periodic domains; Seismic waves","Abramovitz, M., Stegun, I.A., Handbook of mathematical functions (1972) 10th Printing, , National Bureau of Standards; Bard, P.Y., Michel Campillo, F., Chavez-Garcia, J., Sanchez-Sesma, F., The Mexico earthquake of September 19 (1988) 1985-A theoretical investigation of large-and small-scale amplification effects in the Mexico City Valley, 4 (3), pp. 609-633. , Earthq Spectra; Bard, P.Y., Chazelas, J.L., Gueguen, P.H., Kham, M., Semblat, J.F., Site-City Interaction, Assessing and Managing Risk, 91-114 (2006) Geotechnical, Geological And Earthquake Engineering Assessing and Managing Earthquake RiskGeo-scientific and Engineering Knowledge for Earthquake Risk Mitigation: developments, tools, techniques, 2. , Editors: Carlos Sousa Oliveira, Antoni Roca, Xavier Goula.

Its function is to hold the water which will flow by gravity to help cool the containment vessel in the highly unlikely event of an emergency - one of the AP1000 plant's innovative passive safety systems. The huge amount of water may pose a threat to the integrity of the shield building during an earthquake. In this paper, both modal characteristics and transient response of a scaled elevated water tank model were studied by a shaking table experiment. The acceleration of the supporting structure and displacement of water sloshing were recorded under transient loading. Four numerical models were built, including two-mass equivalent model, single lumped-mass model, and finite element models using Fluid30 and Fluid80 elements. The advantages and disadvantages of different numerical methods were discussed. Moreover, finite element (FE) models of AP1000 shield building were established considering the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) effect. The sloshing phenomenon in PCCWST under resonant three-cycle sine (RTCS) wave and seismic loading was studied. The response of shield building under seismic loading was also studied. The results showed that the maximum von Mises stress occurred at the corner of the air inlet. The shaking table experiment can provide a benchmark for seismic response of an elevated water tank. The FE model of shield building may help improve the design of the AP1000 and CAP1400 in the future. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Temperature ramps (crossing the antigorite thermal stability) were used in conjunction with a new experimental method that allows fluid produced during dehydration reactions to be drained, partially drained or undrained. During temperature ramps, weakening coupled with transient slip initiated at ~650. °C, coincident with the predicted phase transition of antigorite to olivine and talc at ~1GPa. The weakening-rate and steady-state strength were dependent on drainage conditions; undrained samples weakened over a few minutes and supported the lowest shear stress (~50MPa), while drained samples weakened over a few hours and supported the highest shear stress (~210MPa). The coefficient of friction (shear stress over normal stress) in drained samples decreased from ~0.4 to ~0.16 after the temperature ramp. The strengths of samples that were first annealed at 700 °C for ~12h, then deformed, were similar to those observed in the temperature ramp experiments. Strain localization along fractures occurred in all samples during temperature ramping, regardless of the drainage conditions. However, microstructural observations indicate deformation by ductile mechanisms at higher strain under both undrained and drained conditions. The rheology and microstructures suggest dehydrating serpentinite deforms via semibrittle flow with grain-scale ductile deformation more active at high pore fluid pressures. Our results suggest that earthquakes in serpentinized mantle do not nucleate as a direct result of unstable frictional sliding along fractures generated at the onset of dehydration reactions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Dehydration embrittlement; Olivine; Pressure-solution; Semibrittle flow; Serpentine","Abers, G.A., Nakajima, J., van Keken, P.E., Kita, S., Hacker, B., Thermal-petrological controls on the location of earthquakes within subducting plates (2013) Earth Planet.

Though current emphasis has been on identifying and characterizing the potential geological sequestration reservoirs, there is also an urgent need to ensure that the sequestered CO2 will remain in place under reasonable perturbations, e.g., under seismic activity. One of the potential geological reservoirs identified is unmineable coal seams due to the advantage of recovering fuel gas like CH4 while sequestering CO2. Therefore, a closed experimental setup was constructed where Illinois bituminous coal cores could be subjected to compressive shockwaves while simultaneously monitoring the emission of gases from CO2 pressurized coal cores. The results from the pressurized coal cores were compared with the behavior manifested by un-pressurized coal cores as well as porous pumice stone cores, which were also subjected to shockwaves. As expected, the un-pressurized cores showed no significant emission of CO2 when subjected to shock; however, this was not the case for the cores which were pressurized with CO2. The results indicate that massive amounts of CO2 would be emitted if the cores were exposed to atmospheric pressure simulating a situation where caprock has been compromised during primary seismic activity. Irrespective of the belief that coal interacts strongly with CO2, both chemically and physically, compressive (0.374 MPa) shockwaves forced almost all the CO2 to be ejected from the coal cores. Surprisingly, most, if not all, the sequestered CO2 would be emitted in less than 1 h if the cores were subjected to reasonably moderate shocks. In actual seismic activity conditions, one expects conditions to be even more severe than in the experimental setup used in this study because of the presence of compressive and transverse stresses and shears. If such is the case, CO2 may be emitted even faster. It is reasonable to argue that Illinois bituminous coals may not be suitable hosts for sequestering CO2 because the region is prone to seismic activity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper focuses on the subject of liquefaction-induced lateral spreads. Case histories with detailed cone penetration test (CPT) data are derived from the 2010-2011 Canterbury, New Zealand earthquake sequence and used to examine an existing empirical model for liquefaction-induced lateral spreads. The results confirmed the existence of a substantial discrepancy between the predicted and observed lateral spreads, indicating a need for improved models that consider uncertainties in the input parameters. Using a maximum likelihood analysis of the derived case histories, a new empirical probabilistic model was developed for the estimation of lateral spreads in the Christchurch, New Zealand area. Emphasis is placed on assessing the probability of exceedance of limiting displacements for design against the threat of lateral spreads. The new CPT-based probabilistic model with detailed formulations is presented along with an illustrative example.

We benefit from the availability of 62 V<inf>S</inf> models derived from earthquake records, conventional seismic prospecting, and seismic noise array measurements. Five groups of models provided from many different non-invasive and invasive methods (seismic interferometry, stress-strain analysis, annealing simulation, surface wave inversion, cross-hole and down-hole tests, and seismic noise array measurements) lead to averaged V<inf>S</inf> profiles. The estimate of V<inf>S</inf> models that we obtain differs depending on the technique used. In such cases, it becomes clear that, it is better to understand the differences and not simply compute an average. The percentage of the observed disparity with respect to the average reference model albeit is small, becomes significant at certain depths and is associated with the existence of strong vertical discontinuities, thus introducing an uncertainty on the interface definition between the main formations. On the other hand, the use of V<inf>S</inf> profiles in ground simulation studies (especially 2D or 3D) usually implies the need to represent them as gradient functions. Testing representative generalized power law functions, we found that they fail to predict reliably the V<inf>S</inf> model for the total thickness of sediments. To overcome this, a third order polynomial function is proposed. Finally, we test the sensitivity of average V<inf>Sz</inf> index widely used in soil categorization and site amplification studies and find that all V<inf>S</inf> models, either measured or proposed, are equivalent in terms of V<inf>Sz</inf> vanishing any discrimination between layering as well as models. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Earthquake data analysis; Gradient function; Seismic noise array; Seismic prospecting; Shear wave velocity; Vertical strong motion array","Abrahamson, N., Atkinson, G., Boore, D., Bozorgnia, Y., Campbell, K., Chiou, B., Idriss, I.M., Youngs, R., Comparison of the NGA ground-motion relations (2008) Earthq.

As a corollary, individual faults tend to exhibit one sense of slip - normal, reverse, or strike-slip - until whole-scale changes in boundary conditions reactivate preexisting faults in a new deformation regime. In this study, we show that a single continental fault may instead partition oblique strain by alternatively slipping in a strike-slip or a dip-slip sense during independent fault slip events. We use 0.5 m resolution optical imagery and sub-pixel correlation analysis of the 200+ km 2013 Mw7.7 Balochistan, Pakistan earthquake to document co-seismic surface slip characteristics and Quaternary tectonic geomorphology along the causative Hoshab fault. We find that the 2013 earthquake, which involved a ~6:1 strike-slip to dip-slip ratio, ruptured a structurally segmented fault. Quaternary geomorphic indicators of gross fault-zone morphology reveal both reverse-slip and strike-slip deformation in the rupture area of the 2013 earthquake that varies systematically along fault strike despite nearly pure strike-slip motion in 2013. Observations of along-strike variations in range front relief and geomorphic offsets suggest that the Hoshab fault accommodates a substantial reverse component of fault slip in the Quaternary, especially along the southern section of the 2013 rupture. We surmise that Quaternary bimodal slip along the Hoshab fault is promoted by a combination of the arcuate geometry of the Hoshab fault, the frictional weakness of the Makran accretionary prism, and time variable loading conditions from adjacent earthquakes and plate interactions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","2013 Balochistan earthquake; Continental strike-slip faults; Geodesy; Long-term fault slip behavior; Tectonic geomorphology","Ambraseys, N., Bilham, R., Earthquakes in Afghanistan (2003) Seismol.

Using a simplified and idealized analytical model reflecting random characteristics of seismic excitations, maximum pier responses are evaluated. The nonlinear behaviors of reinforced concrete piers and pounding between adjacent bridge decks are included in the analytical model by utilizing a nonlinear hysteresis model and an impact element (a linear viscoelastic model), respectively. From the results of time history analysis, it is found that pounding between adjacent vibration units reduces the pier forces and displacements by restricting the pier motions. As the peak ground acceleration increases, the results of the case without consideration of pounding shows the impractically large pier displacements in the hysteresis model by ignoring restriction of pier motions due to pounding. The results according to the gap distance between impact elements show that the size of gap distance is heavily correlated to the nonlinear pier behaviors. Therefore, the effects of pounding and nonlinear pier behaviors should be considered together to reflect the bridge responses correctly. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bridge; Gap distance; Hysteresis model;

Up to now, quantifying the seismogenic potential of the eastern Makran subduction zone at the northern edge of the Indian ocean has remained elusive due to a paucity of geodetic observations. Furthermore, non-tectonic processes obscure the signature of accumulating elastic strain. Historical earthquakes of magnitudes greater than 7 have been reported. In particular, the 1945 Mw 8.1 earthquake resulted in a significant tsunami that swept the shores of the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. A quantitative estimate of elastic strain accumulation along the subduction plate boundary in eastern Makran is needed to confront previous indirect and contradictory conclusions about the seismic potential in the region. Here, we infer the distribution of interseismic coupling on the eastern Makran megathrust from time series of satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images acquired between 2003 and 2010, applying a consistent series of corrections to extract the low amplitude, long wavelength deformation signal associated with elastic strain on the megathrust. We find high interseismic coupling (i.e. the megathrust does not slip and elastic strain accumulates) in the central section of eastern Makran, where the 1945 earthquake occurred, while lower coupling coincides spatially with the subduction of the Sonne Fault Zone. The inferred accumulation of elastic strain since the 1945 earthquake is consistent with the future occurrence of magnitude 7+ earthquakes and we cannot exclude the possibility of a multi-segment rupture (Mw 8+). However, the likelihood for such scenarios might be modulated by partitioning of plate convergence between slip on the megathrust and internal deformation of the overlying, actively deforming, accretionary wedge. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","InSAR; Interseismic coupling; Makran subduction zone","Agnew, D.C., (2012) SPOTL: some programs for ocean-tide loading, , Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Agram, P.S., Jolivet, R., Riel, B., Lin, Y.N., Simons, M., Hetland, E., Doin, M.P., Lasserre, C., New radar interferometric time series analysis toolbox released (2013) Eos Trans.

The 2010 Ms 7.1 Yushu earthquake occurred on the Yushu fault, causing huge loss of lives and widespread damages to the densely populated Yushu area. So far, much effort has been devoted to the surface rupture and paleoseismology of the Yushu fault, while the late Quaternary activity of the Batang fault has not received much attention. The Batang fault has a clear geomorphic expression with fault scarps, sag ponds, push-ups, systematic offset of fluvial terraces, and alluvial fans along its trace. Integrated methods of geomorphological mapping, outcrop analysis, trench excavation and logging, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), and radiocarbon (14C) dating are employed to study the latest Pleistocene and Holocene paleoseismology of the Batang fault. Several paleoearthquakes are identified from geomorphic and stratigraphic evidence between 22ka and after 2.7ka. The oldest event (E1) occurred after 22kaBP, E2 prior to 14kaBP, E3 within 14 and 9.5kaBP, E4 within 8.0-7.8kaBP, E5 prior to 6.7kaBP, the penultimate event (E6) occurred within 4.3-4.0kaBP, and the most recent event (E7) occurred after 2.7kaBP. The average recurrence interval of paleoearthquakes for the Batang fault is about 2000a in the last ~8kaBP, and the relapse time of the latest paleoearthquake is <2.7ka. Co-seismic displacement of the most recent surface-rupturing event is about 3m, as deduced from the offsets of the youngest terrace risers and of small gullies. Empirical equations between co-seismic displacement and earthquake magnitude reveal that the average magnitude of these events is about 7.3. This study contributes important information for the seismic hazard assessment of the densely populated Yushu area. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Batang fault; Ganzi-Yushu fault; Late Pleistocene paleoseismology; Ms 7.1 Yushu earthquake","Biasi, G.L., Weldon, R.J., Estimating surface rupture length and magnitude of paleoearthquakes from point measurements of rupture displacement (2006) Bull.

In the event of a major earthquake, objects may slide/rock and this dynamic action affects the way in which the supporting structure responds to the ground motion. Because such movement is accompanied by energy dissipation associated to friction and/or impact, only a portion of the live load effectively contributes to the inertial forces acting on the structure. This paper presents a lumped-parameter model that describes the seismic behavior of a single-degree-of-freedom (SDF) structure supporting a rigid block with the possibility to slide. After evaluating its capability using finite element software and shake table test results, the numerical model was implemented in a statistical methodology to quantify the portion of the block's mass that should be considered as inertia in the seismic design of one-story storage structures. Various structural periods T, friction coefficients μ, block-to-structure mass ratios α, response modification factors R were included in a parametric study, which involved thousands of analysis cases. In addition, two seismic hazard levels were considered consistent with service and extreme conditions. It was found that the portion of live load that should be included as inertia in seismic design increases significantly with T, μ, and R. However, the variable that best correlates with seismic mass is the total acceleration Amax experienced by the SDF platform alone. If Amax is small, the blocks may behave as rigidly attached to the structure, so their total mass should be included as inertia in the seismic analysis of storage facilities; this may be the case of structures subjected to service ground motions or designed for R values larger than 3. Finally, a design expression is proposed to estimate the portion of the live load to be included as inertia in function of the maximum total floor acceleration, the live load to structure self-weight ratio and the friction coefficient at the block-structure interface. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Live load as inertia; Seismic mass; Storage structures; Structure-rigid block interaction","Minimum design loads for buildings and other structures (2010) Am Soc Civ.

Ferry Rd., Narragansett, RI, United States","The Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) represents the result of a significant event in the Earth's geologic history. Limited geophysical and geochemical data, as well as the plateau's relative isolation in the Pacific ocean, have made interpretation of the modern day geologic structure and its 120 Ma formation history difficult.Here we present the highest resolution image to date of the wave speed structure of the OJP region. We use a data set that combines Rayleigh waves extracted from both ambient noise and earthquake waveforms and an iterative finite-frequency tomography methodology. The combination of datasets allow us to best exploit the limited station distribution in the Pacific and image wave speed structures between 35 km and 300 km into the Earth.We image a region of fast shear wave speeds, greater than 4.75 km/s, that extends to greater than 100km beneath the plateau. The wave speeds are similar to as observed in cratonic environments and are consistent with a compositional anomaly that resulted from the residuum of eclogite entrainment during the plateau's formation.The combination of our imaged wave speed structure and previous geochemical work suggest that a surfacing plume head entrained eclogite from the deep mantle and accounts for the anomalous buoyancy characteristics of the plateau and observed fast wave speeds. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Ambient noise; Large igneous province; Oceanic plateau; Tomography","Auzende, J.-M., Pelletier, B., Eissen, J.-P., The North Fiji basin geology, structure, and geodynamic evolution (1995) Backarc Basins, pp. 139-175. , Springer; Auzende, J.-M., Pelletier, B., Lafoy, Y., Twin active spreading ridges in the North Fiji basin (southwest pacific) (1994) Geology, 22 (1), pp. 63-66; Bascou, J., Barruol, G., Vauchez, A., Mainprice, D., Egydio-Silva, M., EBSD-measured lattice-preferred orientations and seismic properties of eclogites (2001) Tectonophysics, 342 (1), pp. 61-80; Becker, T., On recent seismic tomography for the western United States (2012) Geochem.

Although the electrical substations are often in service condition, any horizontal excitation due to the earthquake, or any extreme event, may cause lateral deformation and damage to the post insulators. Hollow composite post insulators, a new and evolving technology, have a very complex mechanical behavior due to their materials and connections. To date, the design of such post insulators has been based on the limited test results available in the literature. Most of experiments have been conducted on small-scale specimens focusing on the elastic response. This study presents a series of experiments conducted on a full-scale electrical hollow composite post insulator to investigate the static and dynamic mechanical behaviors, while a computational model is derived. The test series comprise, pull and cyclic quasi-static tests in addition to impact hammer tests, to assess the mechanical behavior of the insulators subjected to the lateral forces at different stages of damage. The key experimental results include the pre-peak force-displacement relationship, the cyclic response, the stiffness and strength deteriorations, and failure modes. The modal frequencies and the corresponding viscous damping ratios for the undamaged and damaged post insulator are calculated using the results of impact hammer tests. An analytical model is derived from the mechanical behavior to simulate the response of the un-damaged and damaged post insulator, and is verified by the test results. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Analytical model; Cyclic test; Dynamic behavior; Electrical post insulators; Experimental test; Hollow-core composite insulator","Myrtle, R.C., Masri, S.F., Nigbor, R.L., Caffrey, J.P., Classification and prioritization of essential systems in hospitals under extreme events (2005) Earthquake Spectra, 21, pp. 779-802; Shinozuka, M., Cheng, T., Feng, M., Mau, S.T., Seismic performance analysis of electric power systems (1999) Research progress and accomplishments 1997-1999.

Such calibration is adopted in a new method for ground truth location of earthquakes, achieved from the location relative to a seismic station. The surface wave group travel times were obtained from the NCFs between a station near the earthquake and remote stations. The differential travel times from the NCFs and the surface wave of the earthquake were used in a relative location procedure. When this method was applied to earthquake location with only six seismic stations in western Australia, the location of the Mw 4.1 Kalannie (September 21, 2005) earthquake was found to be accurate to within 2 km compared with the ground truth location with InSAR for which azimuth coverage of seismic stations is preferable. Synthetic tests suggest that the group travel time is slightly affected by focal mechanism and focal depth, thus unknown earthquake source parameters did not introduce substantial bias to earthquake location with the group travel time method. © 2014, Springer Basel.","Ambient seismic noise; estimated Green’s function; ground truth location; relative location; surface wave","Barmin M.

Several studies have been carried out on the focal mechanism, seismic moment, focal depth and rupture model of this earthquake. However, there are still significant differences in the moment release, focal depth and slip asperities among these models. Since most of these models only used a single data set to investigate the source parameters, the reliability of these results is still a concern. In order to make clear the uncertainties and provide a reliable detailed rupture model for the mainshock, we investigated the rupture process of the Van earthquake by a joint inversion of teleseismic broadband seismograms, near-field static GPS displacement records and strong-motion data. The inversion results indicate that the mainshock was dominated by a thrust slip with a small part of a left-lateral strike-slip component below the hypocenter. The rupture initiated at a focal depth of 16 km and propagated to the surface with a relatively low average rupture velocity of ~1.8 km/s, suggesting that the major energy of the earthquake was released in a long-period band, which is the main reason why the seismic moments inverted by a long period or static signals are higher than those obtained by short-period data. Most of the slip occurred around the hypocenter with a maximum slip of more than 3.3 m, and the associated static stress drop was ~3 MPa. The total seismic moment of the whole fault was 5.76 × 1019 N·m, and most energy was released in the first 20 s, which is in the variation range of the released rupture models. The major slip was concentrated at deeper depth and extended to a depth of around 25 km. Meanwhile, the surface rupture was quite small, which explains why only weak ruptures were observed at the surface although caused by such a strong earthquake. © 2014, Springer Basel.","joint inversion; rupture process; stress drop; Van earthquake","Akyuz, S., C.

The numerical method employs a second order accurate two-step projection algorithm including compressibility effects in pressure field due to earthquake. The effects of reservoir bottom absorption are treated by introducing damping terms into the momentum equations. Hydrodynamic response of earthquake excited dam with a sloping face is simulated to demonstrate the accuracy of the present numerical method. Numerical results compared with previous numerical and analytical solutions show that the present immersed boundary method can accurately compute the hydrodynamic forces on inclined and curved dam faces including the effects of water compressibility and reservoir bottom absorption for the possibility of resonance. The proposed numerical method was shown to have significant advantages in computational time and memory usage for the hydrodynamic simulation of large dam-reservoirs with arbitrary geometries. Hydrodynamic forces on a double curvature arch dam subjected to real earthquake induced ground motion are also simulated to demonstrate the capability of the method. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Arch dam; Compressibility; Dam-reservoir; Earthquake; Hydrodynamic pressure; Immersed boundary; Reservoir bottom absorption","Westergaard, H.M., Water pressures on dams during earthquakes (1933) ASCE Trans, 98, pp. 418-433; Chopra, A.K., Hydrodynamic pressures on dams during earthquakes (1967) J Eng Mech Div ASCE, 93 (6), pp. 205-223; Aydin, I., Demirel, E., Hydrodynamic modeling of dam-reservoir response during earthquakes (2012) J Eng Mech ASCE, 138 (2), pp. 164-174; Chwang, A.T., Housner, G.W., Hydrodynamic pressures on sloping dams during earthquakes.

Field investigations showed that tension failure plays an important role in failure mechanism, and the tension failure is due to the effect of a large vertical seismic motion that occurred in the meizoseismal area during the earthquake. Firstly, two key issues in seismic analysis of near-fault large-scale landslide are proposed: i) how to select and correct the severe near-fault excitations with significant co-seismic displacements and ii) how to consider the effect of the landslide scale on estimation of material strength. Then, in order to investigate the effect of the severe vertical seismic force on the initiation of the huge Daguangbao landslide, five cases, 1) static; 2) pseudo-static only-horizontal; 3) pseudo-static horizontal-and-vertical; 4) dynamic only-horizontal; 5) dynamic horizontal-and-vertical, are performed using the finite difference program FLAC3D. The simulation results are presented in terms of tension failure area, factor of safety, and displacement. The results confirm the significant effects of vertical seismic force on seismic slope failure mechanism as the tension failure areas and the displacements observed in the case of horizontal-and-vertical are larger than those observed in the case of only-horizontal. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","FLAC3D; Large-scale; Near-fault; Seismic slope; Tension failure; Vertical seismic","Aoi, S., Kunugi, T., Fujiwara, H., Trampoline effect in extreme ground motion (2008) Science, 332 (5902), pp. 727-730; Boore, D.M., Effect of baseline corrections on displacements and response spectra for several recordings of the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan, earthquake (2001) Bull Seismol Soc Am, 91 (5), pp. 1199-1211; Chen, G., Li, Y., Zhang, Y., Wu, J., Earthquake induced a chain disasters (2011) Earthquake research and analysis-statistical studies, observations and planning: InTech, pp. 383-416. , S.

This paper tries to answer very important questions related to the seismic risk at city scale that were not yet adequately answered. First, we analyze and highlight the bottlenecks of previous risk-related studies. Based on new researches in the hazard of Bucharest (recent microzonation map and ground-motion prediction equations, reprocessed real recorded data) and in vulnerability assessment (analytical methods, earthquake loss estimation software like SELENA and ELER, the recently implemented Near Real-Time System for Estimating the Seismic Damage in Romania) we provide an improved estimation of the number of buildings and population that could be affected, for different earthquake scenarios.

The analysis is conducted using the ""generalized tangential"" technique in which the Hoek-Brown strength is replaced by an ""optimal"" tangential Mohr-Coulomb domain within the framework of the kinematic approach of limit analysis theory. In order to better understand the influence of these factors including geometrical features, rock strength parameters and seismic loading, a parametric study is carried out. An expression is derived and used to obtain a least upper bound solution for the bearing capacity of a footing on a rock slope considering a kinematically admissible log-spiral failure mechanism. In addition, a similar expression of the horizontal yield seismic coefficient is derived for a given load acting on the foundation.The assessment of earthquake-induced permanent displacement is performed by a simplified procedure. This requires the knowledge of a ground motion parameter that can be evaluated by site-specific seismic hazard analyses or ground motion prediction equations and that considers the actual sliding surface. The calculated displacement should not be greater than a selected limiting tolerable displacement for the specific case. An example is presented illustrating the application of the design procedure for the bridge foundations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Earthquake-induced displacement; Hoek-Brown failure criterion; Rock slope; Seismic bearing capacity; Strip footing","De Buhan, P., Gaernier, D., Three dimensional bearing capacity analysis of a foundation near a slope (1988) Soils Found, 38 (3), pp. 153-163; Sawada, T., Nomachi, S.G., Chen, W.F., Seismic bearing capacity of a mounded foundation near a down-hill slope by pseudo-static analysis (1994) Soils Found, 34 (1), pp. 11-17; Sarma, S.K., Chen, Y.C., Bearing capacity of strip footings near sloping ground during earthquakes.

The earthquake was responsible for initiating a tsunami that mostly affected the northwestern coast of the island. Runup values from a post-tsunami survey indicated the waves reached up to 6 m. A controversy regarding the source of the tsunami has resulted in several numerical simulations involving either fault rupture or a submarine landslide as the most probable cause of the tsunami. Here we follow up on previous simulations of the tsunami from a submarine landslide source off the western coast of Puerto Rico as initiated by the earthquake. Improvements on our previous study include: (1) higher-resolution bathymetry; (2) a 3D–2D coupled numerical model specifically developed for the tsunami; (3) use of the non-hydrostatic numerical model NEOWAVE (non-hydrostatic evolution of ocean WAVE) featuring two-way nesting capabilities; and (4) comprehensive energy analysis to determine the time of full tsunami wave development. The three-dimensional Navier–Stokes model tsunami solution using the Navier–Stokes algorithm with multiple interfaces for two fluids (water and landslide) was used to determine the initial wave characteristic generated by the submarine landslide. Use of NEOWAVE enabled us to solve for coastal inundation, wave propagation, and detailed runup. Our results were in agreement with previous work in which a submarine landslide is favored as the most probable source of the tsunami, and improvement in the resolution of the bathymetry yielded inundation of the coastal areas that compare well with values from a post-tsunami survey. Our unique energy analysis indicates that most of the wave energy is isolated in the wave generation region, particularly at depths near the landslide, and once the initial wave propagates from the generation region its energy begins to stabilize. © 2014, Springer Basel.","1918 Mona; non-hydrostatic model; submarine landslide; three-dimensional model; tsunami; tsunami energy; volume of fluid","Abadie, S.M., Harris, J.C., Grilli, S.T., Fabre, R., 2012.

Fifteen electronic databases were examined using an array of keyword search strings to comprehensively gather all available sources of information spanning 1868-2012. AD. 222 references were identified as directly relevant to tsunami hazard, assessment and risk in A-NZ with a further 51 references identified by scrutinising the original 222 references. The amount of information as well as the emphasis of the science contained in these 273 references differs greatly between documents. A meta-analysis of this collective scholarship shows six principal areas of scientific endeavour: (i) observation and cataloguing of modern and historical tsunami impacts caused by earthquakes and landslides, (ii) modelling and evaluation of near- and far-field generated tsunamis, (iii) detailed mapping and assessment of offshore seismic and other geological structures responsible for near-field tsunami generation, (iv) investigation and cross-referencing of Holocene palaeo-records of tsunami deposits preserved in wetlands, dunes and other coastal landforms, (v) survey and reconnaissance of modern and historical tsunami impacts, and (vi) guidance for tsunami hazard mitigation, preparedness and land-use planning. Synthesising all of these references, it is clear that A-NZ has been affected by remote, regional and locally generated tsunami during the historic, pre-written and pre-human periods. Further, scientific knowledge of tsunami risk and the forces responsible for tsunami generation has greatly improved. However, in spite of the many scientific advances detailed in this review, much more remains to be done to better understand and deal with the diverse tsunami hazard and risk facing A-NZ. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aotearoa; Earthquake; Hazard; New Zealand; Palaeotsunami; Tsunami","Amodeo, C.F., The great earthquake wave of 1868 (1985) N.

As relative density of the sand deposit increases significantly following the initial liquefaction, one should expect that the soil can improve its liquefaction resistance. However, earthquake records indicate that densified sand can be liquefied again (re-liquefied) at smaller cycles by the similar seismic loadings. This work aims to clarify the counterintuitive finding that, after the first liquefaction, the resulting significant increase in relative density (induced by settlements and variation of the water level) do not necessarily imply an increase in the number of loading cycles for re-liquefaction. In this paper, we present a series of experimental results concerning the cyclic liquefaction and the following re-liquefaction of clean sand deposits. The experimental setup is performed by a shaking table, transmitting one-degree of freedom transversal motion to the soil within the 1.5 m high laminar shear box. At four different seismic demands, the input excitation was imposed three times to examine the influence of the initial distributions of the relative density and the consolidation characteristics on the liquefaction potential of the sand. The re-liquefaction cycles of the sand, which previously experienced liquefaction under the same seismic loadings, show that post-liquefaction reconsolidation of the sand deposits affects the re-liquefaction resistance. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Clean sand; Coefficient of consolidation; Liquefaction resistance; Re-liquefaction resistance; Relative density; Shake table test","Castro, G., Poulos, S.J., Factors affecting liquefaction and cyclic mobility (1977) J Geotech Eng Div, 103, pp. 501-516; Ecemis, N., Simulation of seismic liquefaction: 1-g model testing system and shaking table tests (2013) Eur J Environ Civil Eng, 17 (10), pp. 899-919; Fiegel, G.L., Kutter, B.L., Liquefaction mechanism for layered soils (1994) J Geotech Eng, 120 (4), pp. 737-755; Finn, W.D.L., Bransby, L., Pickering, D.J., Effect of strain history on liquefaction of sand (1970) J Soil Mech Found Div, 96 (SM6), pp. 1917-1934; Ha, I.S., Olson, S.M., Seo, M.W., Kim, M.M., Evaluation of reliquefaction resistance using shaking table tests (2011) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 31, pp. 682-691; Ishihara, K., Okada, S., Yielding of overconsolidated sand and liquefaction model under cyclic stress (1978) Soils Found, 18 (1), pp. 57-72; Ishihara, K., Okada, S., Effect of large preshearing on cyclic behavior of sand (1982) Soils Found, 22 (3), pp. 109-125; Ishihara, K., Yoshimine, M., Evaluation of settlements in sands following liquefaction during earthquakes (1996) Soils Found, 32 (1), pp. 173-188; Jamiolkowski, M., Ladd, C.C., Germaine, J.T., Lancellotta R (1985) New developments in field and laboratory testing of soils Proceedings of the 11th international conference on soil mech and foundation engineering, pp. 57-153. , Balkema Publisher, Rotterdam:; Koloski, J.W., Schwarz, S.D., Tubbs, D.W., Geotechnical properties of geologic materials (1989) Wash Div Geol Earth Resour Bull, 78 (1), pp. 1-2; Kulhawy, F.H., Mayne, P.W., Manual on estimating soil properties for foundation design (1990) Report EL-6800, , Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto:; Lee, K.L., Fitton, J.A., Factors affecting the cyclic loading strength of soil (1969) Vib Eff Earthq Soils Found ASTM STP, 450, pp. 71-95; Lee, K.L., Albaisa, A., Earthquake-induced settlements in saturated sands (1974) J Soil Mech Found Div, 100 (4), pp. 387-400; Mesri, G., Feng, T.W., Benak, J.M., Post-densification penetration resistance of clean sands (1990) J Geotech Eng, 116 (GT7), pp. 1095-1115; Mitchell, J.K., Lee, K.M., Shen, C.K., Leung, D.H.K., Effects of placement method on geotechnical behavior of hydraulic fill sands (1999) J Geotech Geoenviron Eng, 125 (10), pp. 832-846; Mulilis, J.P., Arulanandan, K., Mitchell, J.K., Chan, C.K., Seed, H.B., Effects of sample preparation on sand liquefaction (1977) J Geotech Eng Div, 103 (2), pp. 91-108; Oda, M., Kawamoto, K., Fujimori, H., Sato, M., Microstructural interpretation on reliquefaction of saturated granular soils under cyclic loading (2001) J Geotech Geoenviron Eng, 127 (5), pp. 416-423; Ohara, S., Yamamoto, T., Yurino, H., Experimental study on reliquefaction potential of saturated and deposit (1992) Paper presented at the tenth world earthquake engineering conference, , Balkema, Rotterdam:; Olson, S.M., Green, R.A., Obermeier, S.F., Geotechnical analysis of paleoseismic shaking using liquefaction effects: a major updating (2005) Eng Geol, 76, pp. 235-261; Parkin, A.K., Lunne, T., Boundary effects in the laboratory calibration of a cone penetrometer for sand (1982) Proceedings of the 2nd European symposium on penetration testing, 2, pp. 761-768. , ESOPT-II, Amsterdam:; Phillips, R., Valsangkar, A.J., An experimental investigation of factors affecting penetration resistance in granular soils in centrifuge modelling (1987) Technical Report No CUED/D-Soils TR210, , Cambridge University, UK:; Poulos, S.J., Hed, A., Density measurements in a hydraulic fill.

Using 3D Particle Flow Code (PFC3D), uniaxial compression tests have been conducted on discrete element models of rocks with various strength and stiffness properties. An algorithm has also been used to record the AE data in PFC3D models based on the change in strain energy upon each bond breakage. The relation between the total released acoustic energy and total consumed energy by the specimens has been studied both for the real data and numerical models and as a result, a linear correlation is suggested between the released AE energy per volume and consumed energy per volume of the intact rocks. Comparing the recorded acoustic energies in numerical models with real data, suggestions are made for getting realistic AE magnitudes due to bond breakages (cracks) from PFC3D models by proposing a modification on Gutenberg-Richter formula that has been originally proposed for large scale shear induced earthquakes along faults. Also, using the numerical model, an attempt has been made to quantify the damage to the intact rock by proposing a damage parameter defined as the total crack surface observed during the tests divided by the total crack surface possible based on size of particles. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Acoustic emission; Damage quantification; Intact rock; Particle Flow Code (PFC3D); Uniaxial compression test","Amann, F., Button, E.A., Evans, K.F., Gischig, V.S., Blümel, M., Experimental study of the brittle behavior of clay shale in rapid unconfined compression (2011) Rock Mech Rock Eng, 44 (4), pp. 415-430; (2005), ASTM D5878 - standard guides for using rock-mass classification systems for engineering purposes.

Over the last decade, however, it has been shown that consistent information about subsurface structure can be extracted from ambient seismic noise. By cross-correlation of noise simultaneously recorded at two seismic stations, the empirical Green’s function for the propagating medium between them can be reconstructed. Moreover, for periods less than 30 s the seismic spectrum of ambient noise is dominated by microseismic energy and, because microseismic energy travels mostly as surface-waves, the reconstruction of the empirical Green’s function is usually proportional to the surface-wave portion of the seismic wavefield. In this paper, we present 333 empirical Green’s functions obtained from stacked cross-correlations of one month of vertical component ambient seismic noise for different pairs of seismic stations in the Borborema Province of NE Brazil. The empirical Green’s functions show that the signal obtained is dominated by Rayleigh waves and that dispersion velocities can be measured reliably for periods between 5 and 20 s. The study includes permanent stations from a monitoring seismic network and temporary stations from past passive experiments in the region, resulting in a combined network of 34 stations separated by distances between approximately 40 and 1,287 km. Fundamental-mode group velocities were obtained for all station pairs and then tomographically inverted to produce maps of group velocity variation. For short periods (5–10 s) the tomographic maps correlate well with surface geology, with slow velocities delineating the main rift basins (Potiguar, Tucano, and Recôncavo) and fast velocities delineating the location of the Precambrian São Francisco craton and the Rio Grande do Norte domain. For longer periods (15–20 s) most of the velocity anomalies fade away, and only those associated with the deep Tucano basin and the São Francisco craton remain. The fading of the Rio Grande do Norte domain fast-velocity anomaly suggests this is a supracrustal structure rather than a lithospheric terrain, and places new constraints on the Precambrian evolution of the Borborema Province. © 2014, Springer Basel.","Ambient seismic noise; Borborema Province; Rayleigh-wave dispersion; Seismic interferometry; surface wave tomography","Almeida, F.F.M., Carneiro, C.D.R., Machado Jr., D.L., Dehira, L.K., (1988).

Unfortunately, the value of these datasets is not always perceived adequately by decision-making administrators, which has resulted in the destruction (or last-minute salvage) of irreplaceable datasets.We present a quick review of the nature of the datasets of seismological archives, and of specific algorithms allowing their use for the modern retrieval of the source characteristics of the relevant earthquakes. We then describe protocols for the transfer of analog datasets to digital support, including by contact-less photography when the poor physical state of the records prevents the use of mechanical scanners.Finally, we give some worldwide examples of existing collections, and of successful programs of digital archiving of these valuable datasets. © 2015 The Authors.","Analog-to-digital conversions; Data rescue; Historical seismograms","Aki, K., Generation and propagation of G waves from the Niigata earthquake of June 16, 1964.

The objective of the present research is to study whether soil-structure interaction (SSI) and site effects may affect the seismic performance and vulnerability of reinforced concrete moment resisting frame (MRF) buildings and consequently modify the fragility curves. SSI is modeled applying the direct one-step approach considering either linear elastic or nonlinear soil behavior while site effects are inherently accounted for. To further examine the contribution of site and SSI effects, a two-step uncoupled approach is also applied, which takes into account site effects on the response of the fixed base structure, but neglects SSI effects. Additional analyses are performed investigating the influence of the soil depth and stratigraphy under nonlinear soil behavior on the seismic response and fragility of RC buildings. A 9-story RC MRF designed with low seismic code provisions is adopted as a reference structure. A comparative dynamic analysis is performed highlighting various trends in the seismic response of the considered SSI and fixed base systems.

The building consists of three longitudinal parts with a total area of 4800m2 approximately in plan and has two levels of a height of 3m and 12m respectively. The structural system consists mainly of stone masonry walls and a steel roof. Nowadays the building is scheduled to be reused as a Museum of Electric Power and the need for structural upgrade arose mainly from current seismic requirements. According to the structural assessment study, the prevailing problem of the building is the combination of the presence of very high walls, interrupted by transverse walls at a distance of approximately 80m, and the complete lack of horizontal diaphragms. The building's architectural, historic and technological value is significant and its preservation, by minimization of interventions, posed several problems to the retrofit design. New steel frames connected to and cooperating with the masonry walls were designed to bear the vertical roof loads and restore the horizontal diaphragm at the roof level, while also reducing the seismic actions at the walls. The total required strength was achieved by additionally implementing vertical post-tensioning bars and FRP strips. © 2015 The Authors.","Earthquake resistance; Historic masonry; Post-tensioned masonry; Restoration; Retrofit; Strengthening","Ismail, N., (2012) Selected strengthening techniques for the seismic retrofit of unreinforced masonry buildings, , University of Auckland, New Zealand; Islam, M.R., (2008) Inventory of FRP strengthening methods in masonry structures, , Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona; Tomaževič, M., Gams, M., Berset, T., Seismic strengthening of brick masonry walls with composites: an experimental study (2011), Paper 307, Structural Engineers World Congress, Como, ItalyPaulay, T., Priestley, M., (1996) Seismic design of reinforced concrete and masonry buildings (In Greek), , Kleidarithmos, Athens; (2007), STAAD.Pro V8i Structural Analysis and Design Software.

Box 14115-175, Qom, Iran","In recent years, several workers have found numerous cases of sites characterised by significant azimuthal variation of dynamic response to seismic shaking. The causes of this phenomenon are still unclear, but are possibly related to combinations of geological and geomorphological factors determining a polarisation of resonance effects. To improve their comprehension, it would be desirable to extend the database of observations on this phenomenon. Thus, considering that unrevealed cases of site response directivity can be “hidden” among the sites of accelerometer networks, we developed a two-stage approach of data mining from existing strong motion databases to identify sites affected by directional amplification. The proposed procedure first calculates Arias Intensity tensor components from accelerometer recordings of each site to determine mean directional variations of total shaking energy. Then, at the sites where a significant anisotropy appears in ground motion, azimuthal variations of HVSR values (spectral ratios between horizontal and vertical components of recordings) are analysed to confirm the occurrence of site resonance conditions. We applied this technique to a database of recordings acquired by accelerometer stations in the Iranian area. The results of this investigation pointed out some sites affected by directional resonance that appear to be correlated to the orientation of local tectonic lineaments, these being mostly transversal to the direction of maximum shaking. Comparing Arias Intensities observed at these sites with theoretical estimates provided by ground motion prediction equations, the presence of significant site amplifications was confirmed. The magnitude of the amplification factors appear to be correlated to the results of HVSR analysis, even though the pattern of dispersion of HVSR values suggests that while high peak values of spectral ratios are indicative of strong amplifications, lower values do not necessarily imply lower amplification factors. © 2014, Springer Basel.","Arias intensity; Directional resonance; HVSR; Iran; Site response","Arias, A., A measure of earthquake intensity, in Seismic Design for Nuclear Power Plants (ed.

For this purpose, carbon/epoxy composite wrap was used on API 5L grade X65 pipeline which is the typical material for oil and gas transportation pipelines. Mechanical behavior of the pipelines under strike-slip faulting was studied using nonlinear finite element code ABAQUS. The pipeline was supposed to be perpendicular to the fault plane. Proper performance criteria were used to determine critical fault displacements. According to defined performance criteria, critical fault displacements for different diameter to thickness ratios, various composite wrap thicknesses, and for both non-pressurized and pressurized pipelines were determined. Percentages of increase in critical fault displacements compared to non-wrapped conditions were calculated. In some pressurized pipelines, increasing strain in the ruptured area of composite wrap on the pipeline led pipeline to rupture at ultimate tensile strain of the pipe material. Results indicate that using 1-mm-thick composite wrap for non-pressurized pipelines leads critical fault displacement to increase about 100%. In addition, by increasing the thickness of composite wrap, the value of critical fault displacement increases significantly, so that applying composite wraps with thicknesses of 1 and 10. mm on pressurized pipelines with diameter to thickness ratio of 144 caused critical fault displacement to increase by 154% and 892%, respectively. According to results of this research, using FRP wraps to reinforce buried steel pipelines under permanent ground deformations is recommended. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Buried steel pipeline; Composite wrap; Numerical analysis; Permanent ground deformation; Pipe wall reinforcement","Vazouras, P., Karamanos, S.A., Dakoulas, P., Finite element analysis of buried steel pipelines under strike-slip fault displacements (2010) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 30 (11), pp. 1361-1376; Fortner, B., Main line mending (1999) Civil Eng, 69 (7), pp. 42-45; Toutanji, H., Dempsey, S., Stress modeling of pipelines strengthened with advanced composites materials (2001) Thin-Walled Struct, 39, pp. 153-165; Goertzen, W.K., Kessler, M.R., Dynamic mechanical analysis of carbon/epoxy composites for structural pipeline repair (2007) Compos Part B, 38, pp. 1-9; Alexander, C., Ochoa, O., Extending onshore pipeline repair to offshore steel risers with carbon-fiber reinforced composites (2010) J Compos Struct, 92, pp. 499-507; Newmark, N.M., Hall, W.J., Pipeline design to resist large fault displacement (1975) Proceedings of the U.S. National Conference On Earthquake Engineering, pp. 416-425; Kennedy, R.P., Chow, A.W., Williamson, R.A., Fault movement effects on buried oil pipeline (1977) J Transp Eng, 103, pp. 617-633. , ASCE; Kennedy, R.P., Kincaid, R.H., Fault crossing design for buried gas oil pipelines (1983) Proceedings of the ASME, PVP Conference, 77, pp. 1-9; Wang, L.R.L., Yeh, Y.A., A refined seismic analysis and design of buried pipeline for fault movement (1985) Earthq Eng Struct Dyn, 13, pp. 75-96; Chiou, Y.J., Chi, S.Y., Chang, H.Y., A study on buried pipeline response to fault movement (1994) ASCE: J Press Vessel Technol, 116 (1), pp. 36-41; Takada, S., Liang, J.W., Li, T., Shell-mode response of buried pipeline to large fault movement (1998) J Struct Eng, 44 A, pp. 1637-1646; Takada, S., Hassani, N., Fukuda, K., A new proposal for simplified design of buried steel pipes crossing active faults (2001) Earthq Eng Struct Dyn, 30, pp. 1243-1257; Kokavessis, N.K., Anagnostidis, G.S., Finite element modelling of buried pipelines subjected to seismic loads: soil structure interaction using contact elements (2006) Proceedings of the ASME PVP Conference, , Vancouver, BC, Canada; Karamitros, D.K., Bouckovalas, G.D., Kouretzis, G.P., Stress analysis of buried steel pipelines at strike-slip fault crossings (2007) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 27, pp. 200-211; Karamitros, D.K., Bouckovalas, G.D., Kouretzis, G.P., An analytical method for strength verification of buried steel pipelines at normal fault crossings (2011) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 31, pp. 1452-1464; Abdoun, T.H., Ha, D., O'Rourke, M.J., Symans, M.D., O'Rourke, T.D., Palmer, M.C., Factors influencing the behavior of buried pipelines subjected to earthquake faulting (2009) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 29, pp. 415-427; Trifonov, O.V., Cherniy, V.P., A semi-analytical approach to a nonlinear stress- strain analysis of buried steel pipelines crossing active faults (2010) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 30, pp. 1298-1308; Trifonov, O.V., Cherniy, V.P., Elastoplastic stress-strain analysis of buried steel pipelines subjected to fault displacements with account for service loads (2012) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 33 (1), pp. 54-62; Vazouras, P., Karamanos, S.A., Dakoulas, P., Mechanical behavior of buried steel pipes crossing active strike-slip faults (2012) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 41, pp. 164-180; Shouman, A., Taheri, F., Compressive strain limits of composite repaired pipelines under combined loading states (2011) J Compos Struct, 93, pp. 1538-1548; Dash, S.R., Jain, S.K., IITK-GSDMA guidelines for seismic design of buried pipelines (Provisions with commentary and explanatory examples) (2007)Naderi, M., Maligno, A.R., Fatigue life prediction of carbon/epoxy laminates by stochastic numerical simulation (2012) J Compos Struct, 94, pp. 1052-1059; Mohitpour, M., Golshan, H., Murray, A., (2007) Pipeline design & construction: a practical approach, , ASME Press, New York, NY; Anastasopoulos, I., Callerio, A., Bransby, M.F., Davies, M.C., Nahas, A.E.L., Faccioli, E., Pecker A, Rossignol E.

To evaluate VS30 at a site, a shear wave velocity (VS) profile extending to a depth of at least 30m must be acquired using in situ seismic tests. In many cases, however, the obtained VS profile does not extend to a depth of 30m due to unfavorable field conditions and limitations of testing techniques. In this study, VS30 and the mean shear wave velocity to depths less than 30m (VSDs) were calculated using VS profiles of more than 30m obtained by seismic tests at 72 sites in Korea, and the correlation between VS30 and VSDs was drawn based on the computed mean VS data. Additionally, a method for extrapolating the VS profile from shallow depths to 30m and bedrock was developed by building a shape curve based on the average data of all VS profiles. These two methods of extrapolating VS30 from shallow VS profiles, using VSDs and a shape curve, resulted in less bias than the simple method in which the lowermost VS value obtained is extended to the depth of 30m. These two extrapolation methods are useful for VS profiles extending to depths of at least 10m. Furthermore, the shape curve method developed in this study may be useful in the western United States as well as in Korea. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Mean shear wave velocity; Seismic test; Shallow depth;

The aim of the experimental campaign was to analyze the influence of the thermal break components on the overall behavior of the mock-up in order to close the gap between the thermal and the seismic requirements in case of strongly irregular RC structures. The analysis of the experimental results is supported by experimental/numerical comparisons using an homogenized constitutive law to describe the behavior of a representative volume element (RVE) of RC. The observations show that the thermal break components do not significantly modify the dynamic behavior of the RC structure and ensure almost the full load transfer between the shearwalls and the connected slabs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","AZALEE; Cast3M; Numerical modeling; Reinforced concrete; Shaking table; TAMARIS; Thermal break component","Alexander, C., Heidebrecht, A., Tso, W., Cyclic load tests on shear wall panels.

Low-cycle fatigue and ratcheting damage accumulation in piping components may occur under repeated reversals of loading induced by earthquake and/or thermomechanical operation. Ratcheting and fatigue damage accumulation can cause failure of piping systems through fatigue cracks or plastic buckling. However, the ratcheting damage induced failures are yet to be understood clearly; consequently, ASME Code design provisions against ratcheting failure continue to be a controversial issue over the last two decades. A systematic set of piping component experimental responses involving ratcheting and a computational tool to simulate these responses will be essential to rationally address the issue. Development of a constitutive model for simulating component ratcheting responses remains to be a challenging problem. In order to develop an experimentally validated constitutive model, a set of elbow experiments was conducted. The loading prescribed in the experiments involved displacement-controlled or force-controlled in-plane cyclic bending with or without internal pressure. Force, displacement, internal pressure, elbow diameter change, and strains at four locations of the elbow specimens were recorded. This article presents and discusses the results from the experimental study. A sister article evaluates seven different constitutive models against simulating these elbow ratcheting and fatigue responses.

The hydrodynamic pressure exerted on the structure by the ocean water, modeled as compressible non-viscous ideal fluid, is calculated taking into account the fluid-structure interaction, the energy absorption by the seabed, and the energy radiation into infinity. From the hydrodynamic pressure, the added mass and the effective load, resulting from the hydrodynamic pressure, are obtained. They are combined with the finite element model of the structure, resulting in a numerical model for the entire coupled system. For validation of the numerical model, the hydrodynamic pressures induced by the vertical motion of the seabed at free field, and due to the vertical vibration of a floating massless rigid disk, are calculated and compared with exact analytical solutions. The developed method is applied to seismic analysis of a simplified support structure for floating offshore wind turbines subjected to the hydrodynamic pressures induced from seaquakes. Analysis results show that dynamic response of a floating offshore structure induced by the vertical seismic motion of the ocean bed can be greatly influenced by the compressibility of sea water and the energy absorption capacity of the seabed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, the performance of high damping rubber bearings (HDRB) and friction pendulum isolators (FPS) has been analyzed. As case study, an emblematic example of elevated tanks collapsed during the Koaceli Earthquake in 1999 at Habas pharmaceutics plant in Turkey is considered. A time-history analysis conducted using lumped mass models demonstrates the high demand in terms of base shear required to the support columns and their inevitable collapse due to the insufficient shear strength. A proper design of HDRB and FPS isolator according to the EN1998 and a complete nonlinear analysis of the isolated tanks proved the high effectiveness of both isolation systems in reducing the response of the case tank. Actually, the stability conditions imposed by the code and a reduced level of convective base shear obtained with the second isolation typology suggests the use of FPS isolators rather than HDRB devices.

Low-cycle fatigue and ratcheting damage accumulation in piping components may occur under load reversals induced by earthquakes or thermomechanical operations. Ratcheting damage accumulation can cause failure of components through cracking or plastic buckling. Hence, design by analysis of piping components against ratcheting failure will require simulation of this response with reasonable accuracy. In developing a constitutive model that can simulate ratcheting responses of piping components, a systematic set of elbow experiments involving deformation and strain ratcheting were conducted and reported in the sister article. This article will critically evaluate seven different constitutive models against their elbow response simulation capabilities. The widely used bilinear, multilinear, and Chaboche models in ANSYS are first evaluated. This is followed by evaluation of the modified Chaboche, Ohno-Wang, modified Ohno-Wang, and Abdel Karim-Ohno models. Results from this simulation study are presented to demonstrate that all the seven models can simulate the elbow force response reasonably. The bilinear and multilinear models can simulate the initial elbow diameter change or strain accumulation, but always simulate shakedown during the subsequent cycles when for some of the cases the experimental trends are ratcheting. Advanced constitutive models like Chaboche, modified Chaboche, Ohno-Wang, modified Ohno-Wang, and Abdel Karim-Ohno can simulate many of the elbow ratcheting responses well, but for some of the strain responses, these models simulate negative ratcheting, which is opposite to the experimental trend. Finally, implications of negative ratcheting simulation are discussed and suggestions are made for improving constitutive models ratcheting response simulation.

For this purpose, three-, six-, and nine-storey reinforced concrete frame structures, considered as low-, medium-, and high-rise frame, respectively, were designed according to reinforced concrete code BAEL 91 and Algerian seismic code RPA 99/Version 2003. Non-linear static pushover analysis using inverted triangular loading pattern and incremental dynamic analysis using a set of seven time-history earthquake records were carried out to compute the R factor components, such as ductility and overstrength factors, with the consideration of failure criteria at both member and structural levels. The results obtained by non-linear static pushover and incremental dynamic analyses are compared. According to the analysis results, it is observed that in the case of non-linear static pushover analysis, the value of the seismic behavior factor decreases as the number of stories increases, whereas in the case of non-linear incremental dynamic analysis, the trend observed is not the same: the value of the seismic behavior factor increases as the number of stories increases. This result shows that the value of the seismic behavior factor depends, among others parameters, on the height of a structure, which parameter is not taken into account by the seismic design codes. In the light of the information obtained from incremental dynamic analyses, it is observed that the value of the seismic behavior factor adopted by the seismic design code RPA 99/Version 2003 is overestimated, especially for low-rise frame structure. This paper also provides conclusions and the limitations of this study. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Ductility factor; Non-linear incremental dynamic analysis; Non-linear static pushover analysis; Overstrength factor; Reinforced concrete frame structures; Seismic behaviour factor","National Center of Applicated Research in Earthquake Engineering (2003) Algeria; Annan, C.D., Youssef, M.A., EL Naggar, M.H., Seismic overstrength in braced frames of modular steel buildings (2009) J Earthq Eng, 13, pp. 1-21; (1995) ATC-19, , Structural response modification factors, Redwood City, California:; Seismic evaluation and retrofit of concrete buildings (1996) vol 1, , Redwood City, California:; (2010) ATC-72-1, , Modeling and acceptance criteria for seismic design and analysis of tall buildings, Redwood City:; Règles Techniques de Conception et de Calcul des Ouvrages et Constructions en Béton Armé suivant la Méthode des Etats Limites (1992) Edition Eyrolles; Bruneau, M., Uang, C.M., Whittaker, A., (1998) Ductile design of steel structures, , McGraw-Hill, New York:; Adrian, C.L., Assemblage et Comportement Sismique de Portiques en Acier et Mixtes Acier-Béton : Expérimentation et Simulation Numérique.

The pioneering definition of varves by De Geer (1912) had been restricted to rhythmically deposited proglacial clays. One century later the meaning of 'varve' has been expanded to include all annually deposited laminae in terrestrial and marine settings. Under favourable basin configurations and environmental conditions, limnic varves are formed due to seasonality of depositional processes from the lake's water column and/or transport from the catchment area. Subsequent to deposition of topmost laminae, the physical preservation of the accumulating varved sequence requires the sustained absence of sediment mixing, for example via wave action or macrobenthic bioturbation. Individual (sub)laminae in varved lake sediments typically express contrasting colours, always differ in terms of their organic, chemical and/or mineralogical compositions, and often also differ with regard to grain-size. Various predominating climatic and depositional conditions may result in clastic, biogenic or endogenic (incl. evaporitic) varved sediments and their mixtures.To reliably establish a varve chronology, the annual character of laminations needs to be determined and verified in a multidisciplinary fashion. Sources and influences of possible errors in varve chronologies are best determined and constrained by repeated varve counts, and by including radioisotopes and correlation with historically documented events. A well-established varve chronology greatly enhances the scientific value of laminated limnic archives by securely anchoring the wealth of multi-proxy palaeoenvironmental information in the form of time-series for multidisciplinary investigations.Applications of varved records are discussed with special reference to advances since the 1980s. These span fields like calibrating radiometric dating methods, reconstructing past changes of the Earth's magnetic field or detecting fluctuations in solar forcing. Once a varve chronology is established it can be applied to precisely date events like volcanic ash layers, earthquakes or human impact, as well as short- and long-term climate (temperature, precipitation, wind, hydroclimatic conditions or flooding) and environmental changes (eutrophication, pollution). Due to their exceptional high temporal resolution and in combination with their robust and accurate ""internal"" time scale in calendar years, annually laminated sediments can be regarded as one of the most precious environmental archives on the continents. These records are necessary to extend temporally limited instrumental records back in time. As such they have societal relevance with regard to risk assessments related to natural hazards arising from e.g. flooding or volcanic eruptions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Calendar-year dating; Climate reconstruction; Environmental variations; Human impact; Varve; Varve chronology; Varve composition; Varve counting; Varve formation; Varve types (clastic varves, biogenic varves, endogenic varves)","Alenius, T., Mikkola, E., Ojala, A.E.K., History of agriculture in Mikkeli Orijärvi, eastern Finland as reflected by palynological and archaeological data (2008) Veg.

The signals had been stored on about 8000 magnetic tapes, which were held at the recording observatory. After hundreds of man-years of work, these digital waveforms together with significant metadata are now available via the project URL, namely http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/pi/Monitoring/Data/ as a modern open database, of use to diverse communities. Three different sets of recording systems were operated at Borovoye, each using several different seismometers and different gain levels. For some explosions, more than twenty different channels of data are available. A first data release, in 2001, contained numerous glitches and lacked many instrument responses, but could still be used for measuring accurate arrival times and for comparison of the strengths of different types of seismic waves. The project URL also links to our second major data release, for nuclear explosions in Eurasia recorded in Borovoye, in which the data have been deglitched, all instrument responses have been included, and recording systems are described in detail. This second dataset consists of more than 3700 waveforms (digital seismograms) from almost 500 nuclear explosions in Eurasia, many of them recorded at regional distances. It is important as a training set for the development and evaluation of seismological methods of discriminating between earthquakes and underground explosions, and can be used for assessment of three-dimensional models of the Earth's interior structure. © 2015 The Authors.","Data rescue; Digital seismograms; Instrument calibration; Nuclear explosion monitoring; Soviet-era nuclear testing","Adushkin, V.V., An, V.A., Seismic observations and underground nuclear shot monitoring at Borovoye Geophysical Observatory (1990) Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR: Fizika Zemli, (12), pp. 47-59. , (also available in English as Physics of the Solid Earth, 1023-1031, #12 for 1990); Adushkin, V.V., An, V.A., Teleseismic monitoring of underground nuclear explosions at the Nevada Test Site from Borovoye, Kazakhstan (1993) Sci Global Security, 3, pp. 289-309; Adushkin, V.V., An, V.A., Ovtchinnikov, V.M., Krashnoshchekov, D.N., A jump of the density on the outer-inner core boundary from the observations of PKiKP waves on the distance about 6 degrees (1997) Trans Russ Acad Sci, 354 (3), pp. 382-385; An, V.A., Bashilov, I.P., Kaazik, P.B., Konovalov, V.A., About normals of magnet digital records from the Geophysical Observatory, Borovoye (2010) Nat Nucl Cent Rep Kaz Bull, 3, pp. 62-69; Baker, Kim, D.W.-Y, Patton, H., Randall, G., Richards, P., Improvements to a major digital archive of seismic waveforms from nuclear explosions: the Borovoye Seismogram Archive (2009) Proceedings of the 31st monitoring research review, , Tucson, Arizona; Bocharov, V.S., Zelentsov, S.A., Mikhailov, V.N., Characteristics of 96 UNTs at the STS (1989) Atomic Energy, 67, pp. 210-214; Engdahl, R., Relocation of Chinese underground nuclear explosions by cluster analysis (2001) Personal Commun; Fujita, K., Mackey, K.G., Hartse, H.E., Ground truth determinations of detonation sites of Peaceful Nuclear explosions in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia), Russia (2013) Bull Seism Soc Am, 103, pp. 730-740; Kedrov, O.K., Ovtchinnikov, V.M., An On-line Analysis System for three component Seismic Data: Method and Preliminary Results (1990) Bull.

It is this social distribution of vulnerability in a given society that may turn hazardous events into disasters for some people and not for others. This distributional approach draws attention to continuities that explain catastrophes as an outcome of the workings of society prior to the event. Expanding on and partially deviating from this approach, in this paper, we draw attention to the social processes whereby vulnerability is modified and renegotiated in the period after the event of natural disaster where resources for disaster alleviation and reconstruction reach local communities. Specifically, we explore the social dynamics of house damage classification in the wake of the 2006 Central Java earthquake, and we explore relations between citizens and the state during post-disaster house reconstruction. We argue that disastrous outcomes of catastrophic events do not follow pre-existing fault lines of vulnerability in a simple or predictable manner, and that the social process of redistribution of vulnerability continues in the post-disaster scenario. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","damage classification; disaster; hybrid kinds; Indonesia; negotiating vulnerability",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929587448

Quite often, the latter aspect is overruled, even though, large isolator displacements are known to be linked with adverse consequences. A class of smart material referred as Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) has recently been proposed to supplement the conventional isolation bearings that is shown to facilitate such trade-off, owing to its Superelastic property. Recent usage of SMA in supplementing rubber bearing to isolate highway bridge is notable. Presently, the SMA is employed in conjunction with the Lead Rubber Bearing (LRB) (referred as SMA-LRB), isolating multi-storied building frame. It is demonstrated that SMA-LRB largely reduces the isolator displacement with very little sacrifice in the isolation efficiency while compared with the conventional LRB. The nonlinear random vibration analysis in conjunction with stochastic linearization of SMA behavior demonstrate that optimal combination of the SMA and LRB characteristics strengths are essential to ensure such performance. This includes minimizing the isolator displacement as well as maximizing the isolation efficiency, dealt in a framework of bi-objective optimization. Robustness of the optimal design is verified through parametric studies concerning the anticipated variations in system parameters and seismic loading. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.","Base isolation; Earthquake; Optimization; Shape Memory Alloy; Stochastic","Spencer, B.F., Nagarajaiah, S., State of the art of structural control (2003) J.

The Great East Japan Earthquake revealed the importance of a public address system with outdoor loudspeakers for emergency announcements and the difficulty of its intelligibility. To achieve a public address system with sufficient intelligibility for residents, one important factor is to suppress sound overlap caused by reflection from terrain or buildings, or caused by the simultaneous emission of other loudspeakers. Recent Internet technologies and devices will contribute to avoid sound overlap caused by the simultaneous emission of other loudspeakers. In this paper, a method of controlling emission timing to minimize the sound overlap caused by the simultaneous emission of other loudspeakers of a public address system is proposed. This method focused on the transmission of a signal between the input and output of a public address system. Under the assumptions that the attenuation and delay factor between a loudspeaker and a listening point depend only on the distance and the directivity of each node is omnidirection, the optimal emission timing for a pair of nodes is expressed in terms of the signal to interference ratio. Then, on the basis of the above optimal emission timing, the emission timing for a set of nodes in a management area is determined. In the proposed method, each node collects and shares the positions of each node obtained by the Global Positioning System via a computer network to determine the emission timing, and then taking into account whether other nodes emit sound or not each node autonomously determines its emission timing and the delay time for other nodes. The proposed method can be implemented without any dedicated hardware and can, therefore, be applied to existing loudspeakers. The delay and error factors in a public address system employing the proposed method are also modeled and estimated. ©2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study selected 21 counties (county-level cities and districts) in Lushan earthquake-stricken area as the research object. Eight indices extracted from remote sensing image data, statistical data, and field investigations are used as analysis indicators. The eight indices are population density, building coverage, road density, number of hospitals per 10,000 persons, number of welfare institutes per 10,000 persons, number of villager committees per 10,000 persons, mobile users’ proportion at year’s end, and number of schools per 10,000 persons. Using Excel and ArcGIS software, the assessment based on entropy value method comprehensively evaluates the social vulnerability to geological hazards of 21 counties. The social vulnerability of study area is divided into five stages (from lowest to highest): areas with the lowest social vulnerability, namely Shimian County and Kangding County; areas with the low social vulnerability, namely Ebian Yi Autonomous County, Tianquan County, Jinkouhe District, Yingjing County, Luding County, and Baoxing County; areas with medium social vulnerability, which are Hongya County, Hanyuan County, Ganluo County, and Lushan County; areas with high social vulnerability, namely Dayi County, Yucheng District, and Emeishan City; and areas with the highest social vulnerability which are Pujiang County, Mingshan County, Qionglai City, Dongpo District, Danling County, and Jiajiang County. The classification of the results can serve as a guide to disaster resilience planning and reconstruction in relation to geological hazards. © 2015 Saudi Society for Geosciences","Entropy; Geological hazards; GIS; Lushan earthquake-stricken area; Social vulnerability",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929440408

Emergency service location problems may be formulated in discrete space or by restricting the potential location(s) to a specified finite set of points in continuous space. We propose a Multicriteria Spatial Decision Support System to identify shelters and emergency service locations in urban evacuation planning. The proposed system has emerged as an integration of the geographical information systems (GIS) and the multicriteria Decision-Making method of Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation IV (PROMETHEE IV). This system incorporates multiple and often conflicting criteria and decision-makers’ preferences into a spatial decision model. We consider three standard structural attributes (i.e., durability density, population density, and oldness density) in the form of spatial maps to determine the zones most vulnerable to an earthquake. The information on these spatial maps is then entered into the ArcGIS software to define the relevant scores for each point with regards to the aforementioned attributes. These scores will be used to compute the preference functions in PROMETHEE IV, whose net flow outranking for each alternative will be inputted in ArcGIS to determine the zones that are most vulnerable to an earthquake. The final scores obtained are integrated into a mathematical programming model designed to find the most suitable locations for the construction of emergency service stations. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method and the efficacy of the procedures and algorithms in an earthquake emergency service station planning case study in the city of Tehran. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","earthquake; emergency service station; geographical information systems; location planning; Multicriteria Spatial Decision Support System; PROMETHEE",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929590688

However, the number of early-warning tsunami buoys being deployed in this area is far fewer than that in the Pacific Ocean. This study investigates a feasible approach for establishing a tsunami early warning system in the South China Sea without deploying buoys. The idea is to integrate existing earthquake early warning systems with a fast computing system for estimating tsunami threats. This study presents an efficient and low-cost tsunami fast computing system for early warning. The widely validated tsunami model, COMCOT is chosen as the kernel. The COMCOT source code has been optimized and parallelized in order to meet the requirements of real-time simulation. The optimized model, iCOMCOT performs at least 10 times faster than the original COMCOT. In addition, a flexible and user-friendly grid/cloud-based portal service has been built, which is also made available for mobile devices. As for the automatic generation of the tsunami sources, a new Source-Scaling relationship, which has been validated by recent mega-earthquakes, is implemented. The 2011 Tohoku tsunami is adopted as a case for validation and demonstration. The modelling results of Manila trench, chosen to demonstrate the application of iCOMCOT, show that the western coast of the Philippines is prone to get tsunami attacks. Furthermore, tsunami from the north segment of Manila trench tend to strike southern Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau area; tsunami from the middle segment, Vietnam. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","COMCOT; Manila subduction; Parallel computation; South China Sea; Tsunami early warning","http://ceeserver.cee.cornell.edu/pll-group/comcot.htm, COMCOTDean, R.G., Dalrymple, R.A., (1991) Water Wave Mechanics for Engineers and Scientists.

Based on MSF’s experience of performing orthopaedic surgery in a number of such settings, we describe: (a) whether it was possible to implement the minimum standards for one of the more rigorous orthopaedic procedures—internal fixation—and when possible, the time frame, (b) the volume and type of interventions performed and (c) the intra-operative mortality rates and postoperative infection rates. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of routine programme data collected between 2007 and 2014 from three MSF emergency surgical interventions in Haiti (following the 2010 earthquake) and three ongoing MSF projects in Kunduz (Afghanistan), Masisi (Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Tabarre (Haiti). Results: The minimum standards for internal fixation were achieved in one emergency intervention site in Haiti, and in Kunduz and Tabarre, taking up to 18 months to implement in Kunduz. All sites achieved the minimum standards to perform amputations, reductions and external fixations, with a total of 9,409 orthopaedic procedures performed during the study period. Intraoperative mortality rates ranged from 0.6 to 1.9 % and postoperative infection rates from 2.4 to 3.5 %. Conclusions: In settings affected by natural disaster or conflict, a high volume and wide repertoire of orthopaedic surgical procedures can be performed with good outcomes when minimum standards are in place. More demanding procedures like internal fixation may not always be feasible. © 2015 The Author(s)","Internal fixation; Minimum standards; Natural disaster and conflict settings; Orthopaedic surgery",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929430847

The aftermath of the earthquake sequence has revealed unique issues and complexities for the owners of commercial and multi-storey residential buildings in relation to unexpected technical, legal, and financial challenges when making decisions regarding the future of their buildings impacted by the earthquakes. The paper presents a framework to understand the factors influencing post-earthquake decisions (repair or demolish) on multi-storey concrete buildings in Christchurch. The study, conducted in 2014, includes in-depth investigations on 15 case-study buildings using 27 semi-structured interviews with various property owners, property managers, insurers, engineers, and government authorities in New Zealand. The interviews revealed insights regarding the multitude of factors influencing post-earthquake decisions and losses. As expected, the level of damage and repairability (cost to repair) generally dictated the course of action. There is strong evidence, however, that other variables have significantly influenced the decision on a number of buildings, such as insurance, business strategies, perception of risks, building regulations (and compliance costs), and government decisions. The decision-making process for each building is complex and unique, not solely driven by structural damage. Furthermore, the findings have put the spotlight on insurance policy wordings and the paradoxical effect of insurance on the recovery of Christchurch, leading to other challenges and issues going forward. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Canterbury earthquakes; Damage; Decision-making; Insurance; Multi-storey concrete buildings; Residual capacity",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929428513

Two different almost parallel NE–SW striking and SE dipping at a steep-angle dextral strike-slip fault zones with small reverse component corresponded to the two events and were activated onland in Paliki. Many earthquake environmental effects (EEE) were induced by both earthquakes in Paliki offering the possibility to apply the ESI 2007 scale. They are classified into primary and secondary effects. Primary effects comprise uplift, subsidence and surface ruptures. Secondary effects include ground cracks, slope movements, liquefaction and hydrological anomalies. The VIII<inf>ESI2007</inf> intensities are assigned to sites of maximum uplift in the central–eastern part of Paliki. The VII<inf>ESI2007</inf> intensities are assigned to sites with maximum subsidence, surface ruptures and large-volume slope movements in the eastern coastal zone of Paliki, the northern part of Paliki and the northern part of Argostoli peninsula, respectively. The VI<inf>ESI2007</inf> intensities are assigned to sites with ground cracks and slope movements mainly in the northern part of Paliki and the western part of Aenos Mt, respectively. The lowest V<inf>ESI2007</inf> intensities are observed in the southern part of Paliki associated with small-volume slope movements. From the comparison of all data, it is concluded that there is a strong correlation between the active faults, the displacement discontinuities detected from already published interferometric analysis and the spatial distribution of the EEE. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Active faults; Cephalonia; Earthquake environmental effects; ESI 2007 scale; Seismic intensity; Strike-slip earthquakes",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929440780

This study examined core samples using X-ray radiography, computed tomography scanning, and grain size analysis to identify temporal changes in the physical and biogenic sedimentary structures of seafloor deposits in Onagawa Bay, northeastern Japan, following the 2011 tsunami. Cores were sampled during research cruises in October 2012, December 2013, and April 2014. The seafloor sediments consisted of two lithological layers. The upper section (between the surface and a depth of 8 cm) was composed of muddy sediments deposited by normal depositional processes and/or the weakening tsunami currents. In contrast, the lower part of the cores (below a depth of 8 cm) consisted of tsunami-induced deposits, i.e., horizontally laminated sandy sediments generated by the strong currents associated with the 2011 tsunami. Sampling of these sediments in 2012 and 2013 showed burrows of up to 10 mm in diameter, but restricted to the upper mud layer. In contrast, in 2014, 20–40-mm-diameter mud-filled burrows were seen in both the upper mud and lower sand layers, indicating that recolonization of the seafloor sediment by large and deep-burrowing animals began within 3 years of the 2011 tsunami. The intense sediment mixing by large burrowing animals will homogenize the seafloor sediment and decrease the preservation potential of the tsunami deposits in this bay. © 2015 The Oceanographic Society of Japan and Springer Japan","Benthos; Bioturbation; Burrow; Event deposit; Impact; Recovery; Sanriku",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929441117

The tsunami caused large disturbances in bottom sediments and severe destruction of human-made structures, natural landscapes and infrastructures such as sewage treatment systems and aquaculture facilities. A serious and continuing concern is a fundamental alteration of the nutrient regime in the impacted regions, which may exert a profound influence on the processes of ecosystem recovery and fishery reconstruction. We investigated the nutrient status of the water column of Otsuchi Bay, a small embayment that was heavily damaged by the tsunami. Our data collected between May 2011 and July 2014 revealed some prominent features in nutrient parameters that were potentially linked to effects of the tsunami. These features include (1) high turbidity and high concentrations of nitrite and silicic acid until September 2011, (2) the spread of seawater characterized by high phosphate concentration and low total inorganic nitrogen (ammonium + nitrate + nitrite) to phosphate (TIN/P) ratio during the mixing period between November 2011 and January 2012, and (3) an increase in the TIN/P ratio during the mixing period of subsequent years to become higher than it was before the earthquake. These data not only provide evidence of the alteration and subsequent recovery of the nutrient status of Otsuchi Bay after the earthquake but also suggest a possible tsunami-induced alteration in nutrient stoichiometry which appeared to last until at least the beginning of 2014. © 2015 The Oceanographic Society of Japan and Springer Japan","Nutrients; Otsuchi Bay; The 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake; Tsunami; Turbidity",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929447951

To sort out signals containing significant modal information from all the dynamic responses of structure, it was made to adopt a Band-pass filter Optimizing Algorithm (BOA) and a Peak-Picking Algorithm (PPA). Optimally designed on the basis of Kobe earthquake signals, it was then embedded into the Wireless Variety Measurement System (WiVMS). In order to evaluate the performance of the developed CAFB, a vibration test was conducted using the Kobe earthquake signals, and structural responses of a two-span bridge were obtained and analyzed simultaneously by both a wired measurement system and a CAFB-based WiVMS. The test results showed that the compressed dynamic responses acquired by the CAFB-based WiVMS matched with those of the wired system, and they included significant modal information of the two-span bridge. Therefore this study showed that the developed CAFB could be used as a new, economic, and efficient measurement device for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) based real time structural health monitoring because it could reconstruct the whole dynamic response using the compressed dynamic response with significant modal information © 2015 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Band-pass Filter Optimizing Algorithm (BOA); Cochlea-inspired Artificial Filter Bank (CAFB); Peak-Picking Algorithm (PPA); Structural Health Monitoring (SHM); Wireless Variety Measurement System(WiVMS)",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928689297

In 2014 OGS, ARSO, ZAMG and UniTS created a cooperative network named the Central and Eastern European Earthquake Research Network (CE3RN), and teamed up with the University of Naples Federico II, Italy, to implement an earthquake early warning system based on the existing networks. Since May 2014, the earthquake early warning system (EEWS) given by the integration of the PRESTo (PRobability and Evolutionary early warning SysTem) alert management platform and the CE3RN accelerometric stations has been under real-time testing in order to assess the system's performance.

We argue that felt induced earthquakes due to geologic CO<inf>2</inf> storage are unlikely because (i) sedimentary formations, which are softer than the crystalline basement, are rarely critically stressed; (ii) the least stable situation occurs at the beginning of injection, which makes it easy to control; (iii) CO<inf>2</inf> dissolution into brine may help in reducing overpressure; and (iv) CO<inf>2</inf> will not flow across the caprock because of capillarity, but brine will, which will reduce overpressure further. The latter two mechanisms ensure that overpressures caused by CO<inf>2</inf> injection will dissipate in a moderate time after injection stops, hindering the occurrence of postinjection induced seismicity. Furthermore, even if microseismicity were induced, CO<inf>2</inf> leakage through fault reactivation would be unlikely because the high clay content of caprocks ensures a reduced permeability and increased entry pressure along the localized deformation zone. For these reasons, we contend that properly sited and managed geologic carbon storage in deep saline formations remains a safe option to mitigate anthropogenic climate change. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

We explore the elder-focused community support system developed in Minamisanriku town after the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011. Many elderly people lost all their material possessions and were moved from their devastated home communities to temporary housing. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 participants including 14 community workers and three members in the Minamisanriku Council of Social Welfare (MCSW) in a programme framed by the MCSW's disaster-response model. Thematic analysis highlighted how older people's involvement in the visiting programme of their temporary community, and conducting twice-daily visits to other vulnerable elders, enabled them to provide valued social support to isolated and homebound peers. It also helped reconstruct their own social identities shattered by the dissolution of former communities, the shock of displacement and loss of possessions. This positive social participation was heavily influenced by strong bridges between their temporary community and MCSW support staff and infrastructure that promoted and supported their visits. Our study highlights how strong and empowering relationships amongst older people can be facilitated by an active government-funded support agency that is immediately responsive to the needs and deeply respectful of the world-views of vulnerable groups.

Grammy-award winning musician Wyclef Jean and actor/director Sean Penn both reacted swiftly by travelling to Haiti and garnered praise for their financial and organisational contributions to the relief efforts. The two men also engaged in a brief conflict over who was the more legitimate activist in Haiti. The symbolically powerful feud between the two men produced themes of transformation, travel, time, and competence that relied upon gendered and racialised norms to position one man as a more authentic activist than the other. Through critical analysis, I argue that transnational media created a narrative around Jean and Penn in which masculinity, ethnic and national identity, and celebrity converge to reinforce oppositional male archetypes. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","activism; celebrity; colonialism; Haiti; masculinity",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929223530

In the present work 20 local earthquakes (M<inf>D</inf>∈[−0.3, 2.2]) occurred in the Campi Flegrei caldera during the last decade were analyzed. We followed this strategy: empirical relations were used to calibrate synthetic modeling, accounting for the source features and wave propagation effects. Once the source and path parameters of ground motion simulation were obtained from the reference data set, we extrapolated scenarios for stronger earthquakes for which real data are not available.The procedure is structured in two steps: (1) evaluation of ground motion prediction equation for Campi Flegrei area and assessment of input parameters for the source, path and site effects in order to use the finite fault stochastic approach (EXSIM code); (2) simulation of two moderate-to-large earthquake scenarios for which only historical data or partial information are available (M<inf>w</inf>4.2 and M<inf>w</inf>5.4). The results show that the investigated area is characterized by high attenuation of peak amplitude and not negligible site effects. The stochastic approach has revealed a good tool to calibrate source, path and site parameters on small earthquakes and to generate large earthquake scenario. The investigated magnitude range represents a lower limit to apply the stochastic method as a calibration tool, due to the small size of involved faults (fault length around 200/300 m). © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Campi Flegrei; Peak velocity; Stochastic simulation",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929094547

In order to reproduce the measured containment pressure, it was necessary to model a leak from the reactor coolant system. Recirculation pump seal leak, starting 5 h after the earthquake, was assumed in this study. The reactor pressure vessel lower head was calculated to fail, and all fuel was discharged to the containment. Almost all of the radioactive noble gases and about 0.05% of the cesium inventory were released to the environment, according to this calculation.

This paper provides a succinct and holistic overview on the physical and functional performances of the gas, water, waste water, road and electric networks (this one to a limited extent for the L’Aquila case-study), following the moment magnitude (M<inf>w</inf>) 6.3 L’Aquila earthquake, and two main events of the Canterbury earthquake sequence, namely: the M<inf>w</inf> 7.1 September 4, 2010 Darfield and the M<inf>w</inf> 6.2 February 22, 2011 Christchurch earthquakes. A structured format, based on internationally recognised taxonomies and damage descriptors, is introduced to present the assets and to report on the earthquake-induced physical impacts for both above-ground and underground components. Functional impacts, interdependency issues and resilience attributes observed during the emergency management and recovery phases for the same infrastructure systems are furthermore discussed in the paper. It is envisaged that the data and overview on the seismic performance and management of infrastructure systems presented in the paper can be used to test the effectiveness of existing models and to inform the development of new models for seismic risk assessment and resilience analysis.

Event deposits 1–7 cm thick were observed at the topmost part of the sediment cores at all sampling stations. At some stations, prokaryotic cell abundances were lower in the surface event-deposit layers compared to those in deeper sediments. These variations were explained by environmental parameters such as a dimensionless sorting factor and mean grain size, suggesting that turbidite sedimentation affected prokaryotic cell abundances. Nematodes had anomalously higher subsurface abundances at the stations where subsurface peak prokaryotic cell numbers were observed, whereas copepods always showed peak densities in the sediment surface layer. Although there are no available data for prokaryotic cell abundances and meiofaunal densities before the earthquake from the same sites, it is likely that the subsurface peaks in prokaryotic cell numbers and nematode densities resulted from the sedimentation events. The effects of sedimentation events on the organisms were observed 1 year after the earthquake, indicating that episodic sedimentation events on scales of several centimeters have a large effect on small organisms inhabiting sediments. © 2015 The Oceanographic Society of Japan and Springer Japan","Benthic disturbance; Macrofauna; Meiofauna; Prokaryote; Upper bathyal depth; Virus-like particles",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929119387

While the constitutive model parameters of the suspensions are crucial to characterize their flow through granular soils, the determination of the model parameters is challenging because the flow characteristics of the bentonite suspensions vary with the amount of ionic additives and resting time. The objective of this study is to investigate the constitutive model parameters of concentrated bentonite suspensions modified with sodium pyrophosphate (SPP) in the context of their flow through granular soils and stability over time. 7.5, 10, and 12 wt% bentonite suspensions were tested at 0–7 wt% SPP concentrations. The time-dependent behavior of 10 wt% suspensions was also monitored at various resting times. Yield stress, flow consistency index (K) (or plastic viscosity), and flow behavior index (n) were determined by matching the experimental data to the Herschel–Bulkley or Bingham model. The results show that the yield stresses of the suspensions reach approximately 1 Pa at 1, 2, and 4 wt% SPP for the 7.5, 10, and 12 wt% suspensions, respectively. The K values increase sharply and then decrease with the increase of SPP concentration. The n values decrease with the initial dosage of the SPP, but increase with the additional amount of the SPP, converging to approximately 0.8. The yield stress of SPP-modified suspensions increases over resting time and the n values converge to 1. The critical storage modulus of the modified suspensions increases as yield stress increases, producing a strong time-independent correlation with yield stress. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929093585

Ocean-bottom monitoring of offshore seismicity off southern Kyushu, Japan, recorded a complete episode of low-frequency tremor, lasting for 1 month, that was associated with very-low-frequency earthquake (VLFE) activity in the shallow plate interface. The shallow tremor episode exhibited two migration modes reminiscent of deep tremor down-dip of the seismogenic zone in some other subduction zones: a large-scale slower propagation mode and a rapid reversal mode. These similarities in migration properties and the association with VLFEs strongly suggest that both the shallow and deep tremor and VLFE may be triggered by the migration of episodic slow slip events. © 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Most of foreign media have admired Japanese people for their cooperative attitude and morals, in that predatory practices and price-gouging rarely occur, even after the huge earthquake that struck Japan on March 11, 2011. On the other hand, they have also criticized the lack of leadership and responsibility in government and public administration in terms of responding to disasters, in particular the crisis of nuclear melting. With such a high evaluation for Japan’s collective behavior, why are not Japanese attitudes in terms of leadership and responsibility at an individual level often ethical and honest? When trying to provide an answer to this question, we focus on the construct of empowerment and leadership. The managerial and methodological implication is discussed in terms of these key words. We conclude that Japanese-style management can allow leaders to shift blame to their followers and companies therefore have to introduce a kind of manifestation system for management practice in order to control the dysfunction. In addition, scholars should focus on the discourse and narrative of the leader and follower as a methodological change for empowerment study. © 2015 Springer-Verlag London","Dysfunction of Japanese-style management; Empowerment; Leadership; Social construction; Trust",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929120375

We used the Universal Soil Loss Equation and county-level socioeconomic data to assess the changes in the ecosystem service of soil conservation between 2000 and 2010, and to analyze its spatial characteristics and driving factors in the southwestern China. The results showed that cropland in the southwestern China decreased by 3.74%, while urban land, forest, and grassland areas increased by 46.78%, 0.86%, and 1.12%, respectively. The soil conservation increased by 1.88 × 1011 kg, with deterioration only in some local areas. The improved and the degraded areas accounted for 6.41% and 2.44% of the total land area, respectively. Implementation of the Sloping Land Conversion Program and urbanization explained 57.80% and 23.90% of the variation in the soil conservation change, respectively, and were found to be the main factors enhancing soil conservation. The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake was one of the factors that led to the degradation of soil conservation. Furthermore, industrial adjustment, by increasing shares of Industry and Service and reducing those of Agriculture, has also promoted soil conservation. Our results quantitatively showed and emphasized the contributions to soil conservation improvement made by implementing ecological restoration programs and promoting urbanization.

A vast range of lead rubber bearings with different periods is considered to evaluate the effect of the isolation degree on seismic responses of the structures. The simulation results confirm that the base isolators are able to reduce rotation of stories. However, this reduction is negligible in large eccentricities. The numerical simulations show that increasing period of isolators results in large displacement at bearings located on the flexible edge of the isolation system. This paper proposes practical solutions to reduce torsional responses of the base-isolated structures. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions, four structural models are defined. Considering three earthquake excitations, the simulation results of these models indicate that increase in stiffness of flexible edge of isolation system can reduce torsional responses of asymmetric 3-story base isolated structure.

However, societal responses to erosion and shoreline retreat often result in man-made coastal defence structures that cover part of the intertidal and upper shore zones causing coastal squeeze and habitat loss, especially for upper shore biota, such as dune plants. Coseismic uplift of up to 2.0 m on the Peninsula de Arauco (South central Chile, ca. 37.5° S) caused by the 2010 Maule earthquake drastically modified the coastal landscape, including major increases in the width of uplifted beaches and the immediate conversion of mid to low sandy intertidal habitat to supralittoral sandy habitat above the reach of average tides and waves. To investigate the early stage responses in species richness, cover and across-shore distribution of the hitherto absent dune plants, we surveyed two formerly intertidal armoured sites and a nearby intertidal unarmoured site on a sandy beach located on the uplifted coast of Llico (Peninsula de Arauco) over two years. Almost 2 years after the 2010 earthquake, dune plants began to recruit, then rapidly grew and produced dune hummocks in the new upper beach habitats created by uplift at the three sites. Initial vegetation responses were very similar among sites. However, over the course of the study, the emerging vegetated dunes of the armoured sites suffered a slowdown in the development of the spatial distribution process, and remained impoverished in species richness and cover compared to the unarmoured site. Our results suggest that when released from the effects of coastal squeeze, vegetated dunes can recover without restoration actions. However, subsequent human activities and management of newly created beach and dune habitats can significantly alter the trajectory of vegetated dune development. Management that integrates the effects of natural and human induced disturbances, and promotes the development of dune vegetation as natural barriers can provide societal and conservation benefits in coastal ecosystems. © 2015 Rodil et al.",,"Brown, A.C., Biology of sandy beaches (2001) Encyclopedia of Ocean Sciences, 5, pp. 2496-2504. , Steele JH, Thorpe SA, Turekian KK, editors.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data on disaster-affected patients with type 2 diabetes who periodically attended outpatient department of Soma Central Hospital. There were 767 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in total. The primary outcome measure was the change in HbA1c. Results: HbA1c levels of 58 patients with periodical hospital visits did not deteriorate after the disasters. Moreover, there observed no significant difference in the mean of HbA1c levels among all age and sex throughout the year. While several changes in diabetes medication usage occurred, DPP4-inhibitor was the only oral diabetic agent that increased in frequency (+60%).

Preparedness and mitigation strategies can reduce earthquake-related injuries and deaths and information from casualty models that predict earthquake outcomes can help communities prepare. This study identifies epidemiologic and medical risk factors for earthquake casualties, and compares them with engineering casualty models for the purpose of providing evidence that integrates these approaches. It aims to improve earthquake casualty modeling and to offer better accurate estimations. Epidemiological studies that used analytical designs and reported risk factors related to earthquake-induced casualties and studies that examined the association between medical preparedness and earthquake-induced casualties were reviewed. Engineering casualty estimation models were reviewed to identify which risk factors were considered in the models. Epidemiological studies identified the following risk factors: gender, age, socioeconomic status, physical disability and human behavior. Medical preparedness factors were also related to earthquake-induced injury and death. Global casualty estimation models do not currently consider these factors. This study provides evidence that integrating demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the population and levels of medical preparedness into the existing casualty estimation models may improve their accuracy. © 2015 The Author(s)","Disaster planning; Earthquakes; Mass casualty incidents; Risk assessment; Socioeconomic factors",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928742162

This fault intersects and/or is parallel and at short distances from major infrastructure facilities such as the Athens-Corinth highway, the railway and the Corinth Canal. It is a secondary structure accommodating displacement between the other major E-W trending active faults. It exerts an influence on the topography and the stratigraphy, backtilting Middle Pleistocene sediments on its immediate footwall, showing also significant synsedimentary activity. It has a short length (~5.5 km) and is not expected to produce extensive primary surface ruptures and large displacements (<. 14. cm). Borehole data and correlation between the footwall and hangingwall horizons, indicate that only minor displacement of several meters has been accumulated over the last 175. ka, implying a low slip-rate (~0.04. ±. 0.02. mm/year). Paleoenvironmental interpretations based on borehole data show a very complex sedimentation history during the Middle and Upper Pleistocene that involves subaerial exposure, coastal, lagoonal, shallow marine environments and possibly even some lake sediments. There is strong evidence that this fault was passively ruptured up to 6. cm during the 1981 earthquake sequence and questions emerge on whether part of its throw can be attributed to such a mechanism. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","1981 earthquake sequence; Geodesy; Isthmus; Kalamaki; Ruptures; Saronic Gulf","Anagnostopoulos, A.G., Kalteziotis, N., Tsiambaos, C.K., Geotechnical properties of the Corinth Canal marls (1991) Geotech.

However, the infills can significantly modify the structural behaviour of these frames, which can be detrimental to the seismic performance of buildings. This study investigates the seismic response and failure mechanisms of infilled RC-frame structures with five different infill configurations: (1) full infills, (2) 2/3-storey-height infills, (3) a soft first storey, (4) infills with window openings and (5) infills with door openings. The nonlinear response history behaviour of the masonry-infilled RC frames under four realistic earthquakes, namely, the 1979 El Centro, 1987 Superstition Hills, 1995 Kobe and 1999 Chi-Chi earthquakes, were simulated using discrete-finite element analysis with damage-based constitutive relations. The analysis indicated that the degrees of continuity and regularity of the infill panels crucially affect the seismic performance of structures. As long as out-of-plane collapse of infills does not occur, full-height and continuous-infill panels can enhance the overall stability and energy dissipation of frame structures. By contrast, discontinuous infills can inflict serious damage localised at the points of discontinuity in the frame members. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that the design concept of ""strong column-weak beam"" may not be always applicable to infilled frames. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Discrete finite element; Infilled frame; Nonlinear seismic response analysis; Unreinforced masonry wall","Sezen, H., Whittaker, A.S., Elwood, K.J., Mosalam, K.M., Performance of reinforced concrete buildings during the August 17, 1999 Kocaeli, Turkey earthquake, and seismic design and construction practise in Turkey (2003) Eng Struct, 25, pp. 103-114; (2007) The 2007 August 15 magnitude 7.9 earthquake near the coast of Central Peru, , UK: The Institution of Structural Engineers; (2008) The Wenchuan, China earthquake, , 12 May 2008.

It has been well recognized that the arrangement and constructional detail of infill walls have significant effects on the seismic performance of RC frames. During 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, a lot of masonry infilled RC frame structures suffered serious damages due to detrimental effects brought about by infill walls rigidly connected to the main structure. In the updated Chinese seismic design code, the flexible connection between infill walls and RC frames is recommended in order to reduce the unfavorable interaction between them. In this study, seven full-scale, single-bay and single-storey RC frame specimens, five with masonry infill wall and flexible connection, one with masonry infill wall and rigid connection, and one without infill wall, were tested under low-cycle reversed loads. For the specimens with flexible connection, the variable parameters are the type and amount of constructional column, the amount of tie steel bar, and the amount of vertical slit set in the infill wall. Based on the test results, the damage behavior, lateral strength, displacement ductility ratio, stiffness degradation, and energy dissipation of the specimen are compared. The influence of constructional details of infill walls on the seismic behavior of RC frames is analyzed. It is found that with the addition of masonry infill wall rigidly connected to the frame, the lateral strength, the stiffness and the energy-dissipation capacity of the bare RC frame increase significantly while the displacement ductility ratio decreases significantly. Compared with the infill wall with rigid connection, the strength, the stiffness and the energy-dissipation capacity contributed by the infill wall with flexible connection drop significantly, but the displacement ductility ratio of the frame rises up. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Connection detail; Cyclic loading test; Infill wall; Reinforced concrete moment-resisting frame; Seismic performance","Li, B.X., Wang, Z., Mosalam, K.M., Xie, H.P., Wenchuan earthquake field reconnaissance on reinforced concrete framed buildings with and without masonry infill walls (2008), The 14th world conference on earthquake engineering.

Synchronous noise recordings of 2-20. h were cross-correlated over 20-30. s windows, stacked and iteratively band-pass filtered to enhance the dispersive wave trains. Frequency time analysis was performed on the vertical and radial components of cross-correlations and the fundamental-mode Rayleigh wave group velocity was obtained. Validation of the dispersion data was possible with those obtained from an earthquake recording along a close path. The non-linear inversion of average Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion curves along 13 paths (receiver inter-distances) allowed the definition of shear wave velocity models in the uppermost 1-2. km of the crust.The correlation of V<inf>S</inf> profiles vs. depth and drilling stratigraphy allowed to attribute V<inf>S</inf> lower than 1km/s to tuffs and V<inf>S</inf> of 1.41km/s to very fractured lavas. Higher V<inf>S</inf> are found in the central area of the island, in correspondence of the resurgent area.

The proposed method is based on a simulated design procedure to define the structural model and on non-linear static analysis of a simplified structural model based on Shear-Type assumption to evaluate seismic capacity. Damage States are defined according to the observational-based Damage States provided by the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS-98). Presence of infills is considered, both taking into account their influence on the structural response and evaluating the damage to such non-structural elements. The method is applied to the Reinforced Concrete building stock data provided by the field survey carried out on a city in a high seismic area in Southern Italy, which are illustrated and compared with data from other sources. Uncertainties in seismic demand, material characteristics, and capacity models are taken into account through a Monte Carlo simulation technique. Fragility curves are obtained for each building, leading to the evaluation of annual failure probability at the assumed Damage States. The influence of key parameters in predicting seismic fragility, such as the number of storeys and the age of construction, is illustrated. The spatial distribution of annual failure probability at the different Damage States provides information on areas most prone to seismic risk within the city, depending both on building stock characteristics and on local amplification of seismic hazard due to soil conditions. A comparison with empirical-based fragility curves from literature is also illustrated. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Building stock data; Infills; Large scale; Reinforced Concrete buildings; Simplified seismic fragility assessment","Berry, M., Eberhard, M.O., Performance models for flexural damage in reinforced concrete columns (2003), Report No. UCB-PEER 2003-18.

Several parameters of Cloude decomposition and Freeman–Durden decomposition are introduced to analyse the radar scattering mechanisms over landslides and their surroundings. By analysing the polarimetric characteristics of three typical landslides triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, the result demonstrates that the dominant scattering mechanism of the landslides is the surface scattering component, and the scattering entropy is centred between 0.6 and 0.8. Besides, the result also indicates that the surroundings show the dominance of the volume scattering component, whereas their scattering entropy is almost similar to the landslides. According to the experimental analysis, two temporal SAR images are classified into nine categories, respectively, based on polarimetric decomposition techniques and the Wishart classifier. By comparing the surface scattering areas in the second image with the volume scattering areas in the first image, and combining the scattering entropy, the new slope failures are obtained using the change detection method. In addition, in order to reduce the errors introduced by the registration and noises, the identification map of new landslides is processed by the morphology algorithm. Finally, a field experiment is carried out to verify the existence of the new slope failures and thereby the result shows the validity of the proposed method. © 2015 Taylor & Francis",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929000615

Strong motion generation areas identified within the rupture plane of the 27 March 2013 Nantou, Taiwan, earthquake (M<inf>w</inf> = 5.9) have been modelled in this work. It is seen that all available records are at the surface which include site amplification terms. The modified semi-empirical technique effectively simulates records at rock site. The site amplification terms in all records have been removed using SHAKE 91 program and velocity input at each site. The observed records corrected for site amplification terms are further used for comparison with simulated record at the bedrock from several models. Once the observed records at soil sites are transferred at the bedrock, the next task is selection of final model that gives best fit records. Peak ground acceleration from simulated record at four sites is compared with that from corrected observed data. Since the semi-empirical technique of simulation is strongly dependent on various modelling parameters such as dip, strike, rake, rupture velocity and starting points of rupture, these parameters change iteratively in a specified range in a heuristic way to obtain best modelling parameters. The model giving minimum root mean square error (RMSE) is retained at final model. It is seen that minimum root mean square error of the wave form comparison has been obtained at four stations for the source model having single strong motion generation area. Strong motion records have been simulated at four different recording stations. Comparison of observed and simulated records has been made in terms of RMSE between simulated and observed acceleration records, velocity records and the response spectra at each of four stations. Comparison of waveforms and parameters extracted from observed and simulated records confirms the efficacy of the modified technique to model earthquake characterized by SMGAs. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Nantou earthquake; Semi-empirical; Strong ground motion; Strong motion generation areas",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929096151

These earthquakes have generated substantial site effects on the sedimentary layers, which in turn significantly influence earthquake ground motions in the area. Mapping of site response using microtremor measurements compared with geological and borehole data from Al Khobar City is the main objective of this work. The resonance frequency and the corresponding horizontal-to-vertical (H/V) ratio values have been calculated using the Nakamura technique on data from seismograph instruments deployed at 113 sites in Al Khobar City for different time periods. The recording length was about 1 h with a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. Most of the measured sites present three peaks of resonance frequency; the first peak ranges from 0.33 to 1.03 Hz, the second peak ranges from 1.03 to 1.23 Hz, while the third one ranges from 1.23 to 1.73 Hz. Tests have been conducted to ensure that these peaks are of natural origin The northern zones of Al Khobar City have lower resonance frequency values, indicating great sediment thickness. In contrast, the southern parts of the city have higher resonance frequency values, suggesting shallow bedrock depths. Furthermore, 29 geotechnical boreholes have been drilled to different depths in Al Khobar City. Standard penetration test (SPT) data has been corrected and used to calculate the resonance frequency at their locations. The borehole results showed that the resonance frequency values range from 0.27 to 1.95 Hz. These results are well correlated with those from the microtremor measurements. Accordingly, the first peak has been interpreted as being due to the impedance contrast between the limestone bedrock and the overlying sediments, while the third peak originates from a boundary between the uppermost surface layer and the underlying sediments. © 2015 Saudi Society for Geosciences","Boreholes and amplification; Fundamental frequency; Microtremor",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929103646

These factors can cause the formation of a huge surge and result in the instantaneous failure of a landslide dam. The failure of a landslide dam can threaten people’s lives and property downstream. This paper analyzes the destruction mechanism of landslide dams because of a surge and the impact of the contact area, the landslide height, and the distance between the entry point and the dam site for a dam break through physical experiment and compares the experimental results with the calculated values. Experimental results show that the contact area and the landslide height have a significant impact on the dam-break surge. A measure based on the previously mentioned factors can be made to reduce the dam failure risk caused by a landslide surge. Two empirical methods (Pan’s method and Miller’s method) are used to predict the landslide surge wave and compared with the experimental results; the simulated results show that the Miller’s method used for predicting the landslide surge wave is more reasonable. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Comparative analysis; Dam failure; Experimental study; Landslide surge; Surface water wave",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929121439

It shows that the structural, topographic, and geomorphic architecture of the Kashmir Basin is mainly shaped by an active interaction between the tectonics and climate. This is backed by the historical and geological records, which clearly demonstrate that climate change and unplanned urbanization are NOT the major reasons for flooding. The historical data show that the devastating floods occurred in Jammu and Kashmir before the climate change science came into existence, and this strongly brings into question the climate argument made by the authors and equally challenges the urbanization argument because the population of Kashmir was much less in the past and has increased in the last 24 years, plus urbanization is a recent phenomenon in the history of Kashmir. Therefore, it is an over-exaggeration to claim that unplanned urbanization is the single-most important factor causing the flooding in Jhelum in 2014. It equally questions the proposed construction of an alternate flood channel for the Jhelum River because the geological and tectonic history has clearly shown that a number of destructive floods were caused by earthquakes, and significant drainage reversals have also been reported in the KB. Therefore, it is important to reassess the various causes of flooding and offer a balanced alternative. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Drainage; Jhelum; Kashmir Basin; KBF; Thrust",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928788243

In this paper, we have used numerous data (water radon, gas radon, water level, water temperature) available through CENC for the period 2002-2014 and studied the behavior and characteristics of water 222radon [Rn(w)]. The observed parameters were also complemented by rainfall data retrieved from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. Our detailed analysis shows pronounced changes in the observed parameters (especially water and gas radon) prior to the earthquake. The changes in water radon, ground water level and rainfall showing characteristics behavior for Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes. The long term data analysis of water radon and water level at various locations around epicenters of two major earthquakes along Longmenshan fault show a positive and negative relation of water radon and water level prior to these earthquakes. It is difficult to find any trend of water radon and changes in water radon pattern with these two earthquakes that could prove as a reliable precursor of earthquakes. Changes in the water radon concentrations from one location to other may be associated with the changes in ground water regime and geological settings in the epicentral and surrounding regions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Congress, Suite 100, Tucson, AZ, United States; Seitz, G., California Geological Survey, Menlo Park, CA, United States","Paleoseismic work completed at Hog Lake on the San Jacinto Fault (SJF) near Anza, California, indicates that at least 21 surface ruptures have occurred in the Anza Seismic gap over the past 4,000 years. The ages of the ruptures are constrained by 111 radiocarbon dates, 97 of which fall in stratigraphic order. The average recurrence interval for all ruptures for this period is about 185 ± 105 years, although some ruptures, such as occurred in the April 1918 earthquake, caused only minor displacement. We rate the expression of each interpreted event in each of the twelve developed field exposures presented in this work by assigning numeric values for the presence of different criteria that indicate rupture to a paleo-ground surface. Weakly expressed ruptures, for example the deformation we interpret to be the result of the historical 1918 earthquake, received low scores and are interpreted as smaller earthquakes. From this analysis, we infer that at least fifteen of the identified ruptures are indicative of large earthquakes similar to the penultimate earthquake, inferred to be the M<inf>w</inf> 7.3 22 November 1800 earthquake. The adjusted recurrence interval for large earthquakes lengthens to approximately 254 years. Comparison with the rupture history at the Mystic Lake paleoseismic site on the Claremont strand indicates that it is plausible that several of the large ruptures identified at Hog Lake could have jumped the Hemet step-over at Mystic Lake and continued on the Claremont strand (or vice versa), but most of the event ages do not match between the two sites, indicating that most ruptures do not jump the step. Finally, comparison with San Andreas Fault ruptures both to the north and south of its juncture with the SJF suggest that some northern SJF ruptures identified at Mystic Lake may correlate with events identified at Wrightwood, but that these northern ruptures have no match at Hog Lake and can not indicate rupture of the entire SJF onto the SAF. © 2014, Springer Basel.","Earthquake recurrence patterns; Fault behavior; Paleoseismology; San Jacinto fault","Barnes, P.M., H.

The problems related to the assessment of magnitude are described with more detail; the methodological issues are developed with special reference to the “stable continental region”. The paper first describes how the coefficients of the Boxer method are determined in five tectonic regions of the European area from the relevant calibration data sets, and discusses the problems dealt with while performing this task. Then it describes how the results have been checked against data different from those used in the previous phase. Finally, the application of the new coefficients to nearly a thousand of European earthquakes before 1900 is described. Stressing that, for the first time in Europe, homogeneous results have been obtained at such a large scale, the final part of the paper is devoted to analyse such results, with special reference to the general trends and to some case-histories. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Earthquake catalogue; Earthquake parameters; Historical earthquakes; Intensity attenuation","www.emidius.eu/AHEAD, AHEAD (2013) European archive of historical earthquake data.

The noise-free groundwater-level anomalies consistently comprised by a sequence of decrease, rise and flat phases, which agree very well with changes in strain rates computed from the GPS stations. These coupling agreements show that in addition to compression, tension can be generated before a thrust earthquake occurrence as well. This case demonstrates that short-term surface deformation as signals against noise and accuracy of pre-earthquake anomalous phenomena can be simultaneously examined by using multiple-parameter crosscheck for significantly reducing the uncertainty of earthquake precursory evaluation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Global Positioning System; Groundwater level; Groundwater-strain coupling; Hydrological precursor; The 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake","Bakun, W.H., Aagaard, B., Dost, B., Ellsworth, W.L., Hardebeck, J.L., Harris, R.A., Ji, C., Waldhauser, F., Implications for prediction and hazard assessment from the 2004 Parkfield earthquake (2005) Nature, 437, pp. 969-974; Biagi, P.F., Piccolo, R., Ermini, A., Fujinawa, Y., Kingsley, S.P., Khatkevich, Y.M., Gordeev, E.I., Hydrogeochemical precursors of strong earthquakes in Kamchatka: further analysis (2001) Nat.

The earthquake data were collected from the USGS Web catalog. The rank order statistics of inter-event time series reveal mixed response with distinct breaks in slope suggesting that earthquake dynamics in this region are unstable, but “self-organized.” Comparison of return maps of the data with random, stochastic, and chaotic time records shows quasi-deterministic behavior. We assessed the dimensionality of earthquake-generating mechanism using a nonlinear predictor technique on two-dimensional phase portrait constructed by recurrence time series. The nonlinear forecasting analysis suggests that the earthquake processes in the Sumatra region evolve on a non-random low-dimensional chaotic plane. Further, second-order Kolmogorov entropy “K2” analysis revealed a coherent time structure, indicating quasi-deterministic dynamical pattern. Our result is consistent with “self-organized” processes determined by the internal dynamics, where impulsively derived interdependencies cascade through the tectonic stress generated by plate movement. However, we do not preclude the triggering role of other external processes on the coupled underlying system. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Chaotic dynamics; Entropy; Nonlinear predictability; Random; Rank order; Stochastic; Sumatra earthquake","Bak, P., Christensen, K., Olami, Z., Self-Organized Criticality: Consequences for Statistics and Predictability of Earthquakes (2013) Nonlinear Dyn Predict Geophys Phenom; Bansal, A.R., Ogata, Y., A non-stationary epidemic type aftershock sequence model for seismicity prior to the December 26, 2004 M 9.1 Sumatra–Andaman Islands mega-earthquake (2013) J Geophys Res Solid Earth, 118, pp. 616-629; Bapat, A., Tsunamis and earthquakes in Bay of Bengal.

In total, 420 three-component acceleration records were obtained by the China Strong Motion Networks Centre during this seismic event, among which over 50 records exceeded 100. gal. In the present study, we collected 48 near-fault acceleration records to derive strong ground motion parameters in terms of the peak ground acceleration, peak ground velocity, peak spectrum acceleration (5% of the damping ratio) and spectrum intensity (5% of damping ratio). We determined the building collapse ratios (CRs) for 20 targeted districts based on data acquired from both the China Earthquake Administration and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where the CRs combined the data for all building types. Fragility curves were established between the CRs and the corresponding ground motion parameters, based on which the damage criteria were proposed. In particular, we derived the fragility curves for brick-concrete structures and frame-structures. These curves indicate how different structural types can determine the damage sustained. In addition, we developed a method for estimating building damage classifications. If we assume that buildings are built according to the improved Seismic Fortification Criterion in the revised ""Code for Seismic Design of Buildings"", the predicted CRs for the 20 targeted districts would be significantly lower compared with the actual damage they sustained, which illustrates the validity of both the method and the revised code. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Collapse ratio;

The 2010 $$M = 7.2$$M=7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake was the largest shock in the Salton Trough since 1892 and occurred close to the US-Mexico border, and so the postseismic deformation recorded by the continuous GPS network of southern California provides an opportunity to study the rheology of this region. Three-year postseismic transients extracted from GPS displacement time-series show four key features: (1) 1–2 cm of cumulative uplift in the Imperial Valley and $$\sim$$∼1 cm of subsidence in the Peninsular Ranges, (2) relatively large cumulative horizontal displacements $$>$$>150 km from the rupture in the Peninsular Ranges, (3) rapidly decaying horizontal displacement rates in the first few months after the earthquake in the Imperial Valley, and (4) sustained horizontal velocities, following the rapid early motions, that were still visibly ongoing 3 years after the earthquake. Kinematic inversions show that the cumulative 3-year postseismic displacement field can be well fit by afterslip on and below the coseismic rupture, though these solutions require afterslip with a total moment equivalent to at least a $$M = 7.2$$M=7.2 earthquake and higher slip magnitudes than those predicted by coseismic stress changes. Forward modeling shows that stress-driven afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation in various configurations within the lithosphere can reproduce the early and later horizontal velocities in the Imperial Valley, while Newtonian viscoelastic relaxation in the asthenosphere can reproduce the uplift in the Imperial Valley and the subsidence and large westward displacements in the Peninsular Ranges. We present two forward models of dynamically coupled deformation mechanisms that fit the postseismic transient well: a model combining afterslip in the lower crust, Newtonian viscoelastic relaxation in a localized zone in the lower crust beneath areas of high heat flow and geothermal activity, and Newtonian viscoelastic relaxation in the asthenosphere; and a second model that replaces the afterslip in the first model with viscoelastic relaxation with a stress-dependent viscosity in the mantle. The rheology of this high-heat-flow, high-strain-rate region may incorporate elements of both these models and may well be more complex than either of them. © 2015, Springer Basel.",,"Barbot, S., and Fialko, Y.

This paper applied a detailed inventory with more than 190,000 slope failures and strong ground motion records of 187 seismic stations to analyze the qualitative and quantitative relations between slope failure distribution and seismic parameters. The results revealed that slope failure distribution was exponentially decreased with the increment of epicentral distance and distance from surface fault rupture; peak ground acceleration (PGA) on the hanging wall side was apparently larger than that on footwall side. Linear correlation between concentration of slope failures (LNC) and the percentage of the area affected by slope failure (LAP) and PGA was demonstrated by statistical analysis, which revealed that 0.18~0.21g horizontal PGA was the threshold value of the occurrence of slope failure.

We reanalyze the stress drop values of ~60,000 earthquakes in southern California which were originally determined by Sheareret al. J Geophys Res 111:B06303, (2006) using a spectral method. We modify the dataset to include only stress drops that are derived from at least 10 spectra and with corner frequencies between 3 and 30 Hz, and correct the rupture velocity for increasing S-wave speed with depth. We see no dependence of stress drop on moment magnitude or depth, except for a small, poorly determined increase from 15 to 25 km. We use six crustal geophysics parameters to search for obvious correlations that may explain changes in the mean values of the stress drops: (1) crustal thickness, (2) isostatic gravity, (3) heat flow, (4) shear strain rate, (5) crustal stress regime, and (6) style of faulting. None of the variables reduce the scatter but most can explain up to 10–20 % variations in the mean stress drops. The geographical distribution of the grouped mean stress drops includes very high stress drops near Ridgecrest, eastern California, as well as near fault jogs within the San Andreas Fault system. Low stress drops dominate in trans-tensional regions. Heat flow and GPS-based shear strain rate estimates have the largest influence on stress drop variations. In the range of low to medium heat flow, the stress drops increase with increasing heat flow. In contrast, at high heat flow in thin crust, the stress drops decrease systematically with increasing heat flow. Increasing shear strain rate systematically correlates with decreasing stress drops. The crustal stress regime and style of faulting also influence the stress drops as demonstrated by lower stress drops for north-northeast trending principal horizontal stress and in areas of dip-slip faulting. The mean variations in stress drops with heat flow, stress regime, crustal thickness, and density can be explained in the context of fault healing (grain boundary growth) and corresponding increase in fault zone strength on time scales modulated by the tectonic shear strain rate. © 2014, Springer Basel.","crustal geophysics; Earthquakes; fault zone healing; Southern California; stress drop","Abercrombie, R.E.

The study examines seismicity and focal mechanism data in conjunction with crustal structure derived from receiver functions and gravity gradients, supported by results from GPS data. We present a relation between the north–south depth distribution of the strike-slip earthquakes in Sikkim, with the northward dipping trend of the Indian crust beneath Eurasia deciphered from teleseismic receiver function analysis of data recorded by our seismic network. Results suggest that transverse faults caused by thrust partitioning along the Himalayan arc manifest as vertical strike-slip faults cutting across the crust of the descending Indian plate down to 60 km. Further, we argue in favor of a consistent right-lateral sense of slip among all the strike-slip-type earthquakes cutting across the Himalayan arc from Kumaon in the west through Sikkim and Bhutan Himalaya, to the Burmese arc and the Sagaing fault on the easternmost end. We infer a wrench fault tectonic model for the Indian plate described by a series of right-lateral strike-slip faults from west to east in the Himalaya, in conjunction with under-thrusting of the Indian plate beneath Eurasia. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Sikkim Himalaya; Strike-slip faulting; Transverse fault; Wrench fault tectonics","Bilham, R., Ambraseys, N., Apparent Himalayan slip deficit from the summation of seismic moments for Himalayan earthquakes 1500–2000 (2005) Curr Sci, 88, pp. 1658-1663; Curray, J.R., Moore, D., Lawyer, L., Emmel, F., Raitt, R., Henry, M., Kieckhefer, R., Dickerson, P., Tectonics of the Andaman sea and Burma (1979) Geological and geophysical investigations of continental margins.

Analyses focused on the 267 participants (172 women, 95 men) who were living in central Christchurch in 2009 (i.e., before the Christchurch earthquakes), and who also provided complete responses to our yearly panel questionnaire conducted in late 2010 (largely between the two major earthquakes), late 2011, and late 2012. Levels of psychological distress were similar across the different regions of central Christchurch immediately following the September 2010 earthquake, and remained comparable across regions in 2011. By late 2012, however, average levels of psychological distress in the regions had diverged as a function of the amount of property damage experienced within each given region. Specifically, participants in the least damaged region (i.e., the Fendalton-Waimairi and Riccarton-Wigram wards) experienced greater drops in psychological distress than did those in the moderately damaged region (i.e., across the Spreydon-Heathcote and Hagley-Ferrymead wards). However, the level of psychological distress reported by participants in the most damaged region (i.e., across Shirley-Papanui and Burwood-Pegasus) were not significantly different to those in the least damaged region of central Christchurch. These findings suggest that different patterns of psychological recovery emerged across the different regions of Christchurch, with the moderately damaged region faring the worst, but only after the initial shock of the destruction had passed. © 2015 Greaves et al.",,"Bannister, S., Gledhill, K., Evolution of the 2010-2012 Canterbury earthquake sequence (2012) New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics, 55 (3), pp. 295-304; Kaiser, A., Holden, C., Beavan, J., Beetham, D., Benites, R., Celentano, A., The Mw 6.2 Christchurch earthquake of February 2011: Preliminary report (2012) New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics, 55 (1), pp. 67-90; McColl, G.J., Burkle, F.M., The new normal: Twelve months of resiliency and recovery in Christchurch (2012) Disaster Med Public Health Prep, 6 (1), pp. 33-43. , PMID: 23077265; Rogers, N., Williams, K., Jacka, M., Wallace, S., Leeves, J., Geotechnical aspects of disaster recovery planning in residential Christchurch and surrounding districts affected by liquefaction (2014) Earthquake Spectra, 30 (1), pp. 493-512; Stevenson, J.R., Kachali, H., Whitman, Z., Seville, E., Vargo, J., Wilson, T., Preliminary Observations of the Impacts the 22 February Christchurch Earthquake had on Organisations and the Economy: A Report from the Field (22 February-22 March 2011) (2011) Bulletin of the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering, 44 (2), pp. 65-75; McFarlane, A.C., Posttraumatic phenomena in a longitudinal study of children following a natural disaster (1987) J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 26 (5), pp. 764-769. , PMID: 3667509; McFarlane, A.C., Papay, P., Multiple diagnoses in posttraumatic stress disorder in the victims of a natural disaster (1992) The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 180 (8), pp. 498-504. , PMID: 1500931; McFarlane, A.C., The aetiology of post-traumatic stress disorders following a natural disaster (1988) Br J Psychiatry, 152 (1), pp. 116-121; Nolen-Hoeksema, S., Morrow, J., A prospective study of depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms after a natural disaster: The 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake (1991) J Pers Soc Psychol, 61 (1), pp. 115-121. , PMID: 1890582; Gluckman, P., (2011) The Psychosocial Consequences of the Canterbury Earthquakes, , Office of the Prime Minister's Science Advisory Committee; Gawith, L., How communities in Christchurch have been coping with their earthquake (2011) NZ J Psychol, 40, pp. 121-130; Altindag, A., Ozen, S., One-year follow-up study of posttraumatic stress disorder among earthquake survivors in Turkey (2005) Compr Psychiatry, 46 (5), pp. 328-333. , PMID: 16122532; Chou, F.C., Chou, P., Lin, C., Su, T.T.P., Ou-Yang, W.C., Chien, I.C., The relationship between quality of life and psychiatric impairment for a Taiwanese community post-earthquake (2004) Quality of Life Research, 13 (6), pp. 1089-1097. , PMID: 15287275; Lewin, T.J., Carr, V.J., Webster, R.A., Recovery from post-earthquake psychological morbidity: Who suffers and who recovers?

We combined ambient noise and earthquake data recorded at 1316 seismic stations, the largest number used for the region to date. More than 700,000 dispersion curves were measured to generate group and phase velocity maps at periods of 10-140 s. The resolution of our model is significantly improved over previous models with about 1-2° in eastern China and 2-3° in western China. We also derived models of the study region for crustal thickness and averaged S velocities for upper and mid-lower crust and uppermost mantle. These models reveal important lithospheric features beneath China and provide a fundamental data set for understanding continental dynamics and evolution. Different geological units show distinct features in the Moho depth, lithospheric thickness, and shear velocity. In particular, the North China Craton (NCC) lithosphere shows strong east-west structural variations with thin and low-velocity lithosphere in eastern NCC and thick and high-velocity lithosphere beneath western NCC and the lithosphere of the Ordos Block seems to have undergone strong erosion. The results support the progressive destruction of the NCC lithosphere from east to west at least partly caused by the thermal-chemical erosion of the cratonic lithosphere from the asthenosphere. Another pronounced feature of our model is the strong lateral variations of the mantle lithosphere beneath the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The Indian lithosphere beneath the TP shows variable northward advancement with nearly flat subduction in western and eastern TP and steep subduction in central TP with evidence for the tearing of Indian lithosphere beneath central TP, which may be important for the riftings at the surface in Himalayas and southern TP. The low-velocity zone in northern TP shows strong correlation with the region of the mid-Miocene to Quaternary potassic magmatism, suggesting that delamination of lithosphere may have played an important role in the rise of the TP. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Ambient noise correlation; Lithosphere; North China craton; Rayleigh wave tomography; Tibetan plateau","Bao, X., Xu, M., Wang, L., Mi, N., Yu, D., Li, H., Lithospheric structure of the Ordos block and its boundary areas inferred from Rayleigh wave dispersion (2011) Tectonophysics, 499, pp. 132-141; Bao, X., Song, X., Xu, M., Wang, L., Sun, X., Mi, N., Yu, D., Li, H., Crust and upper mantle structure of the North China craton and the NE Tibetan Plateau and its tectonic implications (2013) Earth Planet.

Around 55,000 local events were recorded from 1997 to 2014. The aim of this study is to assess the magnitude of completeness (M<inf>c</inf>) of an instrumental earthquake catalogue. Three different methods named the maximum curvature (MAXC), b value stability (MBS), and entire magnitude range (EMR) were applied to calculate M<inf>c</inf> and the results are compared together; all of these used methods are catalogue-based methods, in which M<inf>c</inf> is estimated based on departure from the linear frequency-magnitude relation of the local earthquakes published in the ENSN catalogue. Accurate knowledge of the magnitude of completeness M<inf>c</inf> is essential for many seismicity-based studies and particularly for mapping out seismicity parameters such as the b value of the Gutenberg-Richter relationship. The difference in M<inf>c</inf> between the three used methods is 0.9. However, tests performed on the diverse data sets presented here had confirmed that the EMR method is the more accurate method to estimate M<inf>c</inf>. Estimating M<inf>c</inf> solely based on the frequency-magnitude distribution (FMD) has some obvious drawbacks like the difficulty of estimating M<inf>c</inf> in areas of low seismicity. The final results showed that the MAXC technique (M<inf>c</inf> = 1.6 ± 0.02) needs fewer events to reach a stable result. While the MBS results (M<inf>c</inf> = 2.5 ± 0.04) gave always higher M<inf>c</inf> values compared with the other two methods, comparing to the third method, the EMR results (M<inf>c</inf> = 1.8 ± 0.03) maximize the amount of data available for the M<inf>c</inf> determination, which should serve to stabilize the M<inf>c</inf> estimates. This study will play an important role in the future reconfiguration of the ENSN stations. © 2015 Saudi Society for Geosciences","Earthquake catalogue; Magnitude of completeness; Seismic hazard",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928663122

We focused on earthquakes that occurred on inland crustal mega-fault systems, such as the 2008 Wenchuan and 2002 Denali earthquakes, and compiled the source parameters using 11 inland crustal earthquakes which analyses of source rupture processes by waveform inversion as well as investigation of surface ruptures via geomorphological surveys. We found that the maximum surface rupture displacement is two to three times larger than the average slip on the source fault, and the length of the surface rupture is equivalent to the length of the source fault. Furthermore, our compiled data shows the displacement of the surface rupture D saturates around 10 m when the length of the surface rupture L reaches 100 km. Assuming that the average width of the source fault W = 18 km (for Japanese inland crustal earthquakes) and the saturated surface displacement D = 10 m, we found that the scaling relations between rupture area S and seismic moment M<inf>0</inf> have three stages. For the first stage, S is proportional to M<inf>0</inf>2/3 for earthquakes smaller than M<inf>0</inf> = 7.5 × 1018 Nm. For the second stage, S ranges from M<inf>0</inf>1/2 to M<inf>0</inf>2/3, depending on the thickness of the seismogenic zone. For the third stage, S is proportional to M<inf>0</inf> because of the saturation of the slip on the fault. From our compiled data, we derived the third scaling relation between source area S and seismic moment M<inf>0</inf> for inland crustal mega-fault systems to be S (km2) = 1.0 × 10−17M<inf>0</inf> (Nm), where M<inf>0</inf> > 1.8 × 1020 (Nm). © 2014, Springer Basel.","earthquake source model; inland crustal earthquake; mega-fault systems; Scaling relation; strong ground motion prediction","Akyüz, H.S., Hartleb, R., Barka, A., Altunel, E., Sunal, G., Meyer, B., Armijo, R., Surface rupture and slip distribution of the 12 November 1999 Düzce earthquake (M7.1), North Anatolian fault, Bolu, Turkey (2002) Bull.

The main shocks of these earthquakes include the first Racha earthquake (April 29, 1991, Ms = 6.9); second Racha earthquake (June 15, 1991, Ms = 6.2); Oni earthquake (September 7, 2009, Ms = 5.8); and East Black Sea earthquake (December 23, 2012, Ms = 5.6). Based on the simulations with the LPL relaxation model and the ETAS model of triggered seismicity, the differences in the properties of the aftershock processes and the characteristics of the fault zones accommodating the main shocks are revealed. The nonrelaxation character of the aftershocks from the East Black Sea earthquake is established. It is hypothesized and validated that this is a result of the violation of the fluid-dynamic equilibrium in the fault zone due to the destruction of the gas hydrate layer by the main shock and strong aftershocks. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,"Arefiev, S.S., Pletnev, K.G., Tatevossian, R.E., Borisov, B.A., Aptekman, Z.Y., Vasil’ev, V.Y., Delitsyn, L.L., Smith, P., The 1991 Racha earthquake: Results of field seismological observations (1993) Fiz.

The integrated analysis of the earthquake fault association and the reconstruction of the 3D shape of the seismogenic sources were exploited to identify homogeneous seismogenic volumes associated with subsets of geological and focal mechanism data. The independent analysis of geological and seismological data allowed us to observe and highlight similarities between the attitude of the long-term (e.g., Quaternary) and the instantaneous present-day (seismogenic) extensional deformations and to reveal their substantial coaxiality. Coherently, with the results from the kinematic analysis, the stress field inversion also noted a prevailing tensional seismotectonic regime associated with a subhorizontal, NE–SW, minimum stress axis. A minor, very local, and shallow (<5 km) strike-slip component of the stress field was observed in the Colfiorito sector, where an inherited N–S oriented right-lateral fault was reactivated with sinistral kinematics. Instead, an almost total absence of strike-slip solutions was observed in the L’Aquila area. These results do not agree with those indicating Quaternary regional strike-slip regimes or wide areas characterized by strike-slip deformation during the Colfiorito and L’Aquila seismic sequences. © 2014, Springer Basel.","active deformation; central Italy; kinematic analysis; L’Aquila and Colfiorito earthquakes; stress inversion; structural analysis","Amoruso, A., Crescentini, L., Scarpa, R., Inversion of source parameters from near- and far-field observations: an application to the 1915 Fucino earthquake, central Apennines (1998) Italy.

The propagation of the bedrock fault rupture through the overlying soil deposit has been studied by several researchers; however, the effects of fault rupture dynamics, as opposed to pseudostatic fault movement, have not yet been evaluated. There is the potential for dynamic effects to influence significantly structural damage due to the rapid rate of deformation imposed by surface fault rupture. Numerical simulations are performed to analyze the effects of the rate of fault rupture on dip-slip surface fault rupture for free-field and soil-structure interaction conditions. The numerical results indicate that in some limited scenarios, fault rupture dynamics can influence the amount of structural damage expected for a structure located near a fault. However, in most scenarios, fault rupture dynamics is expected to play a secondary role compared to fault, soil, and structural characteristics in evaluating building performance. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Earthquakes; Fling-step; Numerical analysis; Soil-structure interaction; Surface fault rupture","Niccum, M.R., Cluff, L.S., Chamorro, F., Wyllie, L., (1976) Banco Central de Nicaragua: a case history of a high-rise building that survived surface fault rupture, , Idaho Transportation Department, Division of Highways, Boise; Lettis, W., Bachhuber, J., Witter, R., Bachhuber, J., Barka, A., Bray, J.D., Surface fault rupture (2000) Earthq Spectra, 16 (S1), pp. S11-S53; Bray, J.D., Kelson, K.I., Observations of surface fault rupture from the 1906 earthquake in the context of current practice (2006) Earthq Spectra, 22 (S2), pp. S69-S89; Anastasopoulos, I., Gazetas, G., Foundation-structure systems over a rupturing normal fault: Part I.

Fracturing increases the permeability of fault rocks, creating flow-channels for fluid circulation and enhancing the kinetics of such fluid–rock processes as pressure solution or metamorphism. Conversely, healing processes reduce permeability by closing the fractures and lead to rock strengthening. Consequently, the timescales of these two processes are important in determining the strength of fault zones and their ability to rupture during earthquakes. This article reports observations of the microstructure of porous limestone samples subjected to rapid dynamic loading, and long-term healing as a result of fluid percolation. Dynamic loading was performed by impacting the samples with steel bars inside a split Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus. Healing was performed by leaving the samples for three months within a triaxial machine with percolation of supersaturated fluids for five weeks. Two kinds of fracture network were observed in samples damaged at high strain rate: a series of radial and circular macrofractures and an incipient pulverization zone at the center of the sample loaded at the highest strain rate. Fracture density determined microscopically from X-ray images correlates with dissipated energy computed from macro-mechanical data. X-ray images enable good quantification of the damaged state of the samples. Percolation experiments under stress with high-solubility fluid at room temperature show that the main healing processes promoting closure of the fractures in the sample are a combination of mechanical and chemical compaction. Microfracturing networks were found to heal faster than the largest fractures, leading to heterogeneous strengthening of the rock. This feature affects the processes of earthquake nucleation and rupture propagation. © 2014, Springer Basel.",,"Ben-Zion, Y., K. Dahmen, V. Lyakhovsky, D. Ertas and A. Agnon, 1999.

This flat and apparently quiet tectonic domain is, in fact, rather active as it comprises the shortened foreland and foredeep of both the Southern Alps and the Northern Apennines. Assessing its seismic hazard is crucial due to the concentration of population, industrial activities, and critical infrastructures, but it is also complicated because (a) the region is geologically very diverse, and (b) nearly all potential seismogenic faults are buried beneath a thick blanket of Pliocene–Pleistocene sediments, and thus can be investigated only indirectly. Identifying and parameterizing the potential seismogenic faults of the Po Plain requires proper consideration of their depth, geometry, kinematics, earthquake potential and location with respect to the two confronting orogens. To this end, we subdivided them into four main, homogeneous groups. Over the past 15 years we developed new strategies for coping with this diversity, resorting to different data and modeling approaches as required by each individual fault group. The most significant faults occur beneath the thrust fronts of the Ferrara-Romagna and Emilia arcs, which correspond to the most advanced and buried portions of the Northern Apennines and were the locus of the destructive May 2012 earthquake sequence. The largest known Po Plain earthquake, however, occurred on an elusive reactivated fault cutting the Alpine foreland south of Verona. Significant earthquakes are expected to be generated also by a set of transverse structures segmenting the thrust system, and by the deeper ramps of the Apennines thrusts. The new dataset is intended to be included in the next version of the Database of Individual Seismogenic Sources (DISS; http://diss.rm.ingv.it/diss/, version 3.2.0, developed and maintained by INGV) to improve completeness of potential sources for seismic hazard assessment. © 2014, Springer Basel.","Active tectonics; Blind faulting; Inherited faults; Po Plain; Seismic hazard; Seismogenic source","Abrahamson, N.A., Somerville, P.G., Effects of the hanging wall and footwall on ground motions recorded during the Northridge earthquake (1996) Bull.

However, the influence of segment joints on the segmental lining behavior under seismic loading has not been thoroughly considered in the literature. This paper presents a numerical study, which has been performed under seismic circumstance, to investigate the factors that affect segmental tunnel lining behavior. Analyses have been carried out using a two-dimensional finite difference element model. The proposed model allows studying the effect of the rotational joint stiffness, radial stiffness and the axial stiffness of the longitudinal joints. The numerical results show that a segmental lining can perform better than a continuous lining during earthquake. It has been seen that the influence of the joint distribution, the joint rotational stiffness, the joint axial stiffness, Young[U+05F3]s modulus of the ground surrounding the tunnel, the lateral earth pressure factor and the maximum shear strain should not be neglected. Some important differences of the segmental tunnel lining behavior under static and seismic conditions have been highlighted. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Earthquake effect on tunnel; Joint stiffness; Numerical model; Segmental tunnel lining; Seismic analyses; Structural lining forces","Pakbaz, M.C., Yareevand, A., 2-D analysis of circular tunnel against earthquake loading (2005) Tunn Undergr Space Technol, 20, pp. 411-417; Penzien, Z., Seismically induced racking of tunnel linings (2000) Int J Earthq Eng Struct Dyn, 29, pp. 683-691; Hashash, Y.M.A., Park, D., Yao, J.I.C., Ovaling deformations of circular tunnels under seismic loading, an update on seismic design and analysis of underground structures (2005) Tunn Undergr Space Technol, 20, pp. 435-441; Wang, J.N., (1993) Seismic design of tunnels: a state-of-the-art approach, , Brinckerhoff Quade and Douglas Inc, New York; Penzien, J., Wu, C.L., Stresses in linings of bored tunnels (1998) Int J Earthq Eng Struct Dyn, 27, pp. 283-300; Bobet, A., Effect of pore water pressure on tunnel support during static and seismic (2003) Tunn Undergr Space Technol, 18, pp. 377-393; Park, K.H., Tantayopin, K., Tontavanich, B., Owatsiriwong, A., Analytical solution for seismic-induced ovaling of circular tunnel lining under no-slip interface conditions: a revisit (2009) Tunn Undergr Space Technol, 24, pp. 231-235; Park, K.H., Tantayopin, K., Tontavanich, B., Analytical solutions for seismic design of tunnel lining in Bangkok MRT Subway (2006), In: Proceedings of the international symposium on underground excavation and tunnelling.

In the frame of a European Research Program ""FUSEIS"" two innovative seismic resistant systems were introduced and relevant design guides developed. The first system, named FUSEIS1, consists of a pair of closely spaced strong columns joined together by a number of fuses. This system is further subdivided in FUSEIS1-1 where the dissipative fuses are beams and in FUSEIS1-2 where the fuses are short pins. This paper reports on the seismic performance of buildings with FUSEIS1-2 systems. It discusses results of nonlinear static and dynamic analyses that were based on element properties as derived by the tests and provides design recommendations and appropriate behavior factors. The results confirm the good seismic performance of the system under seismic loading and its capacity to develop self-centering properties under certain conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy dissipation; Fuses; Pins; Seismic resistant system; Self-centering","Plumier, A., Doneux, C., Castiglioni, C., Brescianini, J., Crespi, A., Dell'Anna, S., Two INnovations for earthquake resistant design - the INERD project, final report (2004), Research programme of the Research Fund for Coal and SteelVayas, I., Thanopoulos, P., Innovative dissipative (INERD) - pin connections for seismic resistant braced frames (2005) Int J Steel Struct, 5 (5), pp. 453-464; Vayas, I., Thanopoulos, P., Dissipative (INERD) - Verbindungen für Stahltragwerke in Erdbebengebieten (2006) Stahlbau, 75 (12), pp. 993-1003; Vayas, I., Thanopoulos, P., Castiglioni, C., Stabilitätsverhalten von Stahlgeschossbauten mit dissipativen INERD unter Erdbebenbeanspruchung (2007) Bauingenieur, 82 (3), pp. 125-133; Christopoulos, C., Filiatrault, A., Folz, B., Uang, C.-M., Post-tensioned energy dissipating connections for moment-resisting steel frames (2002) ASCE J Struct Eng, 128 (9), pp. 1111-1120; Saeki, E., Iwamatu, K., Wada, A., Analytical study by finite element method and comparison with experiment results concerning buckling-restrained unbonded braces (1996) J Struct Constr Eng, Archit Inst Jpn, 484, pp. 111-120; Sabelli, R., Mahin, S., Chang, C., Seismic demands on steel braced buildings with buckling-restrained braces (2003) Eng Struct, 25 (5), pp. 665-666; Tsai, K.C., Chen, H.W., Hong, C., Su, Y., Design of steel triangular plate energy absorbers for seismic-resistant construction (1993) Earthq Spectra, 9 (3), pp. 505-528; Dargush, G., Soong, T., Behavior of metallic plate dampers in seismic passive energy dissipation systems (1995) Earthq Spectra, 11 (4), pp. 545-568; Tena-Colunga, A., Mathematica modeling of the ADAS energy dissipation device (1997) Eng Struct, 19 (10), pp. 811-820; Dougka, G., Dimakogianni, D., Vayas, I., Innovative energy dissipation systems (FUSEIS1-1) - experimental analysis (2014) J Constr Steel Res, 96 (5), pp. 69-80; Dougka, G., Dimakogianni, D., Vayas, I., Seismic behavior of frames with Innovative Energy Dissipation Systems (FUSEIS1-1) (2014) Earthq Struct, 6 (5); Dimakogianni, D., Dougka, G., Vayas, I., Innovative seismic-resistant steel frames (FUSEIS1-2) experimental analysis (2012) Steel Constr Des Res, 5 (4), pp. 212-221; Vayas, I., Karydakis, P.H., Dimakogianni, D., Dougka, G., Castiglioni, C.A., Kanyilmaz, A., Dissipative devices for seismic-resistant steel frames (FUSEIS) (2013), Research fund for Coal and Steel, European Commission; EU 25901 ENVayas, I., Karydakis, P.H., Dimakogianni, D., Dougka, G., Castiglioni, C.A., Kanyilmaz, A., Dissipative devices for seismic resistant steel frames - the FUSEIS project, design guide (2012), Research programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel(2003), Part 1-1: General rules, seismic actions and rules for buildings.

With ongoing corrosion of embedded rebars the strength and ductility of the structures get further sacrificed. An experimental investigation was undertaken for observing the effects of continuing corrosion process on the strength and ductility aspects of differently confined reinforced concrete short columns. Effect of subsequent strengthening on these degraded columns was also studied. The experimental program consisted of 53 small scale columns with variably confined sections subjected to accelerated corrosion tests. The structural response of under confined sections was observed to be substantially poorer than the properly confined sections, which further degrades considerably due to corrosion of embedded reinforcement. One set of corroded specimens was strengthened with ferrocement jacketing. On another set of degraded columns the glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) wraps were used for strengthening. Quantification was made for the reduction of structural and ductility aspects of both types of columns having different confinement levels. The study emphasizes the immediate need for proper strengthening measures to be adopted for the existing corrosion experiencing structures for improving their much needed ductility considering any seismic event in the future. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

From the 9-component correlation tensors associated with all station pairs we derive dispersion curves of Rayleigh and Love wave group velocities. The dispersion results are inverted first for Rayleigh and Love waves group velocity maps on a 1.5 × 1.5 km2 grid that includes portions of the SJFZ, the San Andreas Fault (SAF), and the Elsinore fault. We then invert these maps to 3D shear wave velocities in the top ~7 km of the crust. The distributions of the Rayleigh and Love group velocities exhibit 2θ azimuthal anisotropy with fast directions parallel to the main faults and rotations in complex areas. The reconstructed 3D shear velocity model reveals complex shallow structures correlated with the main geological units, and strong velocity contrasts across various fault sections along with low-velocity damage zones and basins. The SJFZ is marked by a clear velocity contrast with higher V<inf>s</inf> values on the NE block for the section SE of the San Jacinto basin and a reversed contrast across the section between the San Jacinto basin and the SAF. Velocity contrasts are also observed along the southern parts on the SAF and the Elsinore fault, with a faster southwest block in both cases. The region around the Salton Trough is associated with a significant low-velocity zone. Strong velocity reductions following flower-shape with depth are observed extensively around both the SJFZ and the SAF, and are especially prominent in areas of geometrical complexity. In particular, the area between the SJFZ and the SAF is associated with an extensive low-velocity zone correlated with diffuse seismicity at depth, and a similar pattern including correlation with deep diffuse seismicity is observed on a smaller scale in the trifurcation area of the SJFZ. These results augment local earthquake tomography images that have low resolution in the top few km of the crust, and provide important constraints for studies concerned with behavior of earthquake ruptures, generation of rock damage, and seismic shaking hazard in the region. © 2014, Springer Basel.","azimuthal anisotropy; low-velocity zones; Noise-based imaging; Rayleigh and Love waves; San Jacinto fault zone region; seismic velocity contrasts","Allam, A.

The capacity curve is considered to be composed of a linear part and a nonlinear part. The normalized nonlinear part is modelled by means of a cumulative lognormal function. Instead, the cumulative Beta function can be used. Moreover, this new conceptualization of the capacity curves allows defining stiffness and energy functions relative to the total energy loss and stiffness degradation at the ultimate capacity point. Based on these functions, a new damage index is proposed and it is shown that this index, obtained from nonlinear static analysis, is compatible with the Park and Ang index obtained from dynamic analysis. This capacity based damage index allows setting up a fragility model. Specific reinforced concrete buildings are used to illustrate the adequacy of the capacity, damage and fragility models. The usefulness of the models here proposed is highlighted showing how the parametric model is representative for a family of capacity curves having the same normalized nonlinear part and how important variables can be tabulated as empirical functions of the two main parameters defining the capacity model. The availability of this new mathematical model may be a powerful tool for current earthquake engineering research, especially in seismic risk assessments at regional scale and in probabilistic approaches where massive computations are needed. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Capacity curves; Damage assessment; Energy loss; Fragility curves; Parametric model; Stiffness degradation","Ambraseys, N., Smit, P., Sigbjornsson, R., Suhadolc, P., Margaris, B., Internet-site for European strong-motion data (2002) European Commission, , http://www.isesd.hi.is/ESD_Local/home.htm, Research-Directorate General: Environment and Climate Programme; Ambraseys, N., Smit, P., Douglas, J., Margaris, B., Sigbjornsson, R., Olafsson, S., Suhadolc, P., Costa, G., Internet-site for European strong-motion data (2004) Boll Geofis Teor Appl, 45 (3), pp. 113-129; ATC-13 (1985) Earthquake damage evaluation data for California, , Applied Technology Council, Redwood City, CA:; ATC-25.

Such a damage have demonstrated the deficiency of the actual design approach, that considers cladding panels as non-structural elements, neglecting any interaction with the structure under bi-directional and dynamic seismic excitations. This paper investigates the influence of vertical cladding panels on the first vibration period of one-story precast concrete buildings, with floor rigid in its own plane. At this purpose, a bare structural elastic model and an innovative elastic model of the building with cladding system are implemented and a parametric study is performed. The results of the parametric study show a high influence of the panels on the first period of the analyzed buildings, as well as the inadequacy for this typology of buildings of the simplified relationship for computing the fundamental period proposed by some codes. More suitable formulas are proposed to evaluate the first period in a linear static analysis of one-story precast buildings, both in the case of bare buildings and of buildings with cladding system. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Connection system; First period; Modal analyses; Precast structures; Vertical cladding panels","Baird, A., Diaferia, R., Palermo, A., Pampanin, S., Parametric investigation of seismic interaction between precast concrete cladding systems and moment resisting frames (2011) Paper presented at the Structures Congress, p. 2011; Baird, A., Palermo, A., Pampanin, S., Facade damage assessment of multi-storey buildings in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake (2011) Bull N Z Earthq Eng, 44 (4), pp. 368-376; Biondini, F., Dal Lago, B., Role of wall panel connections on the seismic performance of precast structures (2013) Bull Earthq Eng, 11 (4), pp. 1061-1081; Eurocode 8: design of structures for earthquake resistance—part 1: general rules, seismic actions and rules for buildings (2005) EN 1998–1, , Brussels, Belgium:; Cimellaro, G.P., Reinhorn, A.M., D’Ambrisi, A., De Stefano, M., Fragility analysis and seismic record selection (2011) J Struct Eng, 137 (3), pp. 379-390; Cleland, N., Ghosh, S.K., Seismic design of precast/prestressed concrete structures. 1st edn (2007) PCI; Colombo, A., Toniolo G (2010) Problemi di progettazione sismica delle connessioni dei pannelli di tamponamento Diciottesimo congresso del Collegio dei Tecnici della Industrializzazione Edilizia, pp. 799-806. , Brescia, Italy:; CSI (1978–2011) SAP2000 linear and nonlinear static and dynamic analysis and design of three dimensional structures.

Seismic risk analysis for distributed critical structures requires estimates of the level of earthquake shaking that are likely to occur concurrently at multiple locations: whether the vulnerable elements of a lifeline system are likely to be simultaneously affected by shaking of sufficient strength to disable them and whether the shaking at any one of critical points may be sufficient to cause failure of the whole system. While the analysis of lifeline performance requires multiple-location estimations, the sparsely located elements of a network or critical facilities are designed on the basis of point-wise PSHA. In this paper we study specific features of multiple-location PSHA, as compared with the classical point-wise PSHA, using Monte Carlo simulations. We analyze the level of ground motion (PGA) that will be exceeded at any site inside a particular area or at several sites simultaneously with reference annual probability. The analysis has been performed for regions of Western and South-Western Germany, Northern and Eastern Taiwan, which represent different levels of seismicity (low, moderate and high, respectively). The relationship between the multiple-location and point-wise estimations are analyzed and quantified. Results of the study may be used to decide whether it may be possible to utilize the procedure of point-wise PSHA in particular cases of multiple-location PSHA, i.e. for assessment of maximum level of ground motion among several sites, or for estimation a reasonable lower safety level when considering simultaneous exceedances. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Ground-motion correlation; Importance factor; Multiple-location probabilistic seismic hazard","Akkar, S., Bommer, J.J., Prediction of elastic displacement response spectra in Europe and the Middle East (2007) Earthq Eng Struct Dyn, 36 (10), pp. 1275-1301; Assatourians, K., Atkinson, G.M., EqHaz: an open-source probabilistic seismic-hazard code based on the Monte Carlo simulation approach (2013) Seismol Res Lett, 84, pp. 516-524; Baker, J.W., Jayaram, N., Effects of spatial correlation of ground motion parameters for multi-site seismic risk assessment: collaborative research with Stanford University and AIR.

However, in case of repeated earthquakes, the seismic vulnerability of buildings varies due to damage and this shall be properly considered for the realistic estimate of evolving seismic risk during a seismic sequence. This paper presents a methodology for the assessment of damage-dependent fragility curves for existing reinforced concrete (RC) building classes. The derivation of fragility curves is based on a hybrid method that combines observational based “empirical” curves and mechanical based assessment of buildings’ residual capacity (REC), that is a measure of seismic capacity, which may be reduced due to seismic damage. A mechanism based procedure to assess building REC, and its variation for increasing ductility demand, is presented. Then, in order to be able to apply such procedure to RC building classes, a simulated design procedure is implemented that allows the automatic design of elements dimensions and reinforcement, as well as the characterization of the building nonlinear model needed for mechanism based analysis. Applying a Monte Carlo simulation procedure the geometric, structural and mechanical parameters, from which the design depends on, are varied according to representative distributions and populations of building models are generated and analyzed with mechanism based approach. The procedure is implemented for buildings that are prone to first storey mechanism and is applied for existing RC building classes in L’Aquila. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Fragility curves; Hybrid approach; Mechanism based approach; Reinforced concrete frames; Residual capacity; Time-dependent vulnerability","Guide for seismic rehabilitation of existing concrete frame buildings and commentary.

We review the past 1000. years of unusual events and find evidence for three (possibly four) large tsunamis, one historical and two during the period of Māori occupation prior to European arrival. Event 1 appears to have affected the town of Westport, New Zealand on the 12th August 1870 and Event 2 occurred in the South Taranaki Bight between 1470 and 1510. AD although it may extent farther south along New Zealand's West Coast. There are currently insufficient data to determine whether the West Coast sites represent a separate event or are associated with Event 2. Event 3 occurred between 1320 and 1450. AD along the West Waikato coast of the North Island, New Zealand. In attempting to identify possible tsunamigenic sources for these large events we note the importance of considering a range of potential tsunamigenic options such as complex subduction zone earthquakes and a range of slope failure scenarios in order to better understand the threats posed not only by Tasman Sea sources but for similar geographical locations around the World. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Fault rupture; New Zealand; Seamount; Slope failure; Tasman Sea; Tsunami","Adams, J., Contemporary uplift and erosion of the Southern Alps, New Zealand: summary (1980) Geol.

One free field test was first carried out as a reference, followed by one test with a deep buried structure and one with a shallowly buried structure. During the tests with the buried structure, high quality pictures of moving sand around the structure were recorded by a newly developed image acquisition system. By analyzing the interesting pictures at reasonable intervals using an image analysis software, the evolutions of microstructural features were obtained such as the orientations of the long axes of particles, the orientations of contact normals between particles and the average contact number of the interesting group of particles. The results showed that the evolutions of the micro-features were consistent with those of the macro-measurements such as excess pore pressures and accelerations, which help illuminate the mechanism of sand liquefaction. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Buried structure; Centrifuge model; Micromechanics; Sand; Saturated soils; Shaking table tests; Soil liquefaction","Kawasumi, H., General report on the Niigata Earthquake of 1964 (1968), Tokyo, Japan: Tokyo Electrical Engineering College Press (Editor-in-Chief)Scott, R.F., Zuckerman, K.A., Sandblows and liquefaction (1972) The Great Alaska earthquake of 1964-engineering publication 1606, pp. 179-189. , National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C; O'Rourke, T.D., Lane, P.A., (1989) Liquefaction hazards and their effects on buried pipelines; Shinozuka, M., Ballantyne, D., Borcherdt, R., Buckle, I., O'Rourke, T., Schiff, A., (1995) The Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake of January 17, 1995: performance of lifelines; White, D.J., Contributions to geotechnique 1948-2008: physical modelling (2008) Geotechnique, 58 (5), pp. 413-421; Heidari, M., James, R.G., Centrifuge modelling of earthquake-induced liquefaction in a column of sand (1982) Proceedings of the conference on soil dynamics and earthquake engineering, 1, pp. 271-281; Arulanandan, K., Anandarajah, A., Abghari, A., Centrifugal modeling of soil liquefaction susceptibility (1983) J Geotech Eng, 109 (3), pp. 281-300; Hushmand, B., Scott, R.F., Crouse, C.B., Centrifuge liquefaction tests in a laminar box (1988) Geotechnique, 38 (2), pp. 253-262; Zeghal, M., Elgamal, A.W., Zeng, X., Arulmoli, K., Mechanism of liquefaction response in sand-silt dynamic centrifuge tests (1999) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 18 (1), pp. 71-85; Ling, H.I., Mohri, Y., Kawabata, T., Liu, H., Burke, C., Sun, L., Centrifugal modeling of seismic behavior of large-diameter pipeline in liquefiable soil (2003) J Geotech Geoenviron Eng, 129 (12), pp. 1092-1101; Su, D., (2005) Centrifuge investigation on responses of sand deposit and sand-pile system under multi-directional earthquake loading, , Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, (PhD thesis); Arulanandan, K., Scott, R.F., Project VELACS: control test results (1993) J Geotech Eng, 119 (8), pp. 1276-1292; Kagawa, T., Sato, M., Minowa, C., Abe, A., Tazoh, T., Centrifuge simulations of large-scale shaking table tests: case studies (2004) J Geotech Geoenviron Eng, 130 (7), pp. 663-672; Gonzalez, L., Abdoun, T., Zeghal, M., Kallou, V., Sharp, M.K., Physical modeling and visualization of soil liquefaction under high confining stress (2005) Earthq Eng Eng Vib, 4 (1), pp. 47-57; Zeghal, M., Kallou, P.V., Oskay, C., Abdoun, T., Sharp, M.K., Identification and imaging of soil and soil-pile deformation in the presence of liquefaction (2006) Earthq Eng Eng Vib, 5 (2), pp. 171-182; Oda, M., Kawamoto, K., Suzuki, K., Fujimori, H., Sato, M., Micorstructural interpretation on reliquefaction of saturated granular soils under cyclic loading (2001) J Geotech Geoenviron Eng, 127 (5), pp. 416-423; Zhou, J., Yu, R., Jia, M., Measurement of microstructure parameters for granular soil model using digital image technology (2006) Chin J Geotech Eng, 28 (12), pp. 2047-2052. , (Chinese with English abstract); Gonzalez, R.C., Woods, R.E., (2002) Digital image processing, , Prentice-Hall Inc., New Jersey; Whitman, R.V., Lambe, P.C., Effect of boundary conditions upon centrifuge experiments using ground motion simulation (1986) Geotech Test J, 9 (2), pp. 61-71; Lee, C.J., Wei, Y.C., Kuo, Y.C., Boundary effects of a laminar container in centrifuge shaking table tests (2012) Soil Dyn Earthq Eng, 34 (1), pp. 37-51; Ko, H.Y., Summary of the state-of-the-art in centrifuge model testing (1988) Centrifuges in soil mechanics, pp. 11-18. , Balkema, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, W.H.

In this work, we study such feedback mechanisms for single rupture events and their consequences for earthquake physics and various possible observations. This is done through numerical simulations of in-plane dynamic ruptures on a frictional fault with bulk behavior governed by a brittle damage rheology that incorporates reduction of elastic moduli in off-fault yielding regions. The model simulations produce several features that modify key properties of the ruptures, local wave propagation, and fault zone damage. These include (1) dynamic generation of near-fault regions with lower elastic properties, (2) dynamic changes of normal stress on the fault, (3) rupture transition from crack-like to a detached pulse, (4) emergence of a rupture mode consisting of a train of pulses, (5) quasi-periodic modulation of slip rate on the fault, and (6) asymmetric near-fault ground motion with higher amplitude and longer duration on the side with reduced elastic moduli. The results can have significant implications to multiple topics ranging from rupture directivity and local amplification of seismic motion to near-fault tremor-like signals. © 2014, Springer Basel.","brittle damage; dynamic rupture; fault zone rheology; fracture; friction; Mechanics of faulting","Allam, A.A., and Ben-Zion, Y., (2012), Seismic velocity structures in the Southern California plate-boundary environment from double-difference tomography, Geophys.

This paper presents a novel approach to building change detection in multitemporal VHR synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The proposed approach is based on two concepts: 1) the extraction of information on changes associated with increase and decrease of backscattering at the optimal building scale and 2) the exploitation of the expected backscattering properties of buildings to detect either new or fully demolished buildings. Each detected change is associated with a grade of reliability. The approach is validated on the following: 1) COSMO-SkyMed multitemporal spotlight images acquired in 2009 on the city of L'Aquila (Italy) before and after the earthquake that hit the region and 2) TerraSAR-X multitemporal spotlight images acquired on the urban area of the city of Trento (Italy). Results demonstrate that the proposed approach allows an accurate identification of new and demolished buildings while presents a low false-alarm rate and a high reliability. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Building change detection; change detection; multitemporal images; remote sensing; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); very high geometrical resolution images","Gamba, P., Human settlements: A global challenge for EO data processing and interpretation (2013) Proc IEEE, 101 (3), pp. 570-581. , Mar; Henderson, F., Xia, Z.-G., SAR applications in human settlement detection, population estimation and urban land use pattern analysis: A status report (1997) IEEE Trans.

California Blvd., MC 252-21, Pasadena, CA, United States","Faults are often embedded in low-velocity fault zones (LVFZ) caused by material damage. Previous 2D dynamic rupture simulations (Huang and Ampuero, 2011; Huang et al., 2014) showed that if the wave velocity contrast between the LVFZ and the country rock is strong enough, ruptures can behave as pulses, i.e. with local slip duration (rise time) much shorter than whole rupture duration. Local slip arrest (healing) is generated by waves reflected from the LVFZ–country rock interface. This effect is robust against a wide range of fault zone widths, absence of frictional healing, variation of initial stress conditions, attenuation, and off-fault plasticity. These numerical studies covered two-dimensional problems with fault-parallel fault zone structures. Here, we extend previous work to 3D and geometries that are more typical of natural fault zones, including complexities such as flower structures with depth-dependent velocity and thickness, and limited fault zone depth extent. This investigation requires high resolution and flexible mesh generation, which are enabled here by the high-order accurate arbitrary high-order derivatives discontinuous Galerkin method with an unstructured tetrahedral element discretization (Peltieset al., 2012). We show that the healing mechanism induced by waves reflected in the LVFZ also operates efficiently in such three-dimensional fault zone structures and that, in addition, a new healing mechanism is induced by unloading waves generated when the rupture reaches the surface. The first mechanism leads to very short rise time controlled by the LVFZ width to wave speed ratio. The second mechanism leads to generally longer, depth-increasing rise times, is also conditioned by the existence of an LVFZ, and persists at some depth below the bottom of the LVFZ. Our simulations show that the generation of slip pulses by these two mechanisms is robust to the depth extent of the LVFZ and to the position of the hypocenter. The first healing mechanism is dominant for events with hypocenter inside the LVFZ. The second one is dominant if the hypocenter is deeper than a shallow LVFZ. These results suggest that the depth-dependence of rise time might help constrain the depth extent of the LVFZ. We also show that ruptures can spontaneously stop in flower-like LVFZs with uniform velocity reduction, but continue propagating as slip pulses if velocity reduction is depth-dependent. © 2014, Springer Basel.","Computational seismology; dynamic rupture; earthquake physics; fault zone structures; slip pulse","Ben-Zion, Y., Properties of Seismic Fault Zone Waves and Their Utility for Imaging Low Velocity Structures, J.

The Glacier Lakes fault (GLF) and Granite Pass fault (GPF) are exhumed left-lateral to left-lateral oblique, strike-slip faults with up to 125 m of left-lateral separation exposed in Mesozoic granite and granodiorite plutons. Precipitation of epidote along fault slip-surfaces, chloritization of biotite, saussurite and sericite alteration of plagioclase, and quartz- and-calcite filled veins are present in the GLF and GPF zones. One difficulty encountered in studying exhumed fault zones is providing convincing evidence for a frictional melt origin of pseudotachylyte. Rocks in the field may preserve convincing evidence for frictional melt (i.e., aphanitic, dark, injection structures) that are later shown to be related to cataclasis or injection of hydrothermal fluids. Another challenge results from the low preservation potential of several of the microscopic features that are convincing evidence of a frictional melt origin (microlites, amygdules, and glassy matrix). Here we test the usefulness of grain shape and nearest neighbor distribution analysis of pseudotachylyte and cataclasites from the GLF and GPF to discriminate between these fault rocks and to determine a frictional melt origin for pseudotachylyte. Fabric analyses of the clasts within the pseudotachylytes examined are more circular and exhibit a random nearest neighbor clast distribution relative to adjacent cataclasites. With increased comminution and melting the mean clast circularity increases and the nearest neighbor distances approach a random distribution. We conclude that this observed pattern can be applied to other fault zones as an indicator of a frictional melt origin for fault-related rocks. Mutually cross-cutting zones of hydrothermal alteration and calcite deformation twins constrain the ambient temperature conditions in the fault zone to between 170 and 320 °C during pseudotachylyte formation. Based on previous thermochronologic studies, the temperature conditions of the country rock during faulting were between 110 and 220 °C. The overlapping to elevated temperatures in the fault zone can be explained by: (1) infiltration of hydrothermal fluids into the fault zone; or (2) residual elevated temperatures as a result of frictional heating in the fault zone during seismic slip. © 2014, Springer Basel.","earthquake cycle; fault; fault rocks; hydrothermal alteration; Pseudotachylyte; seismicity","Allen JL (2005) A multi-kilometer pseudotachylyte system as an exhumed record of earthquake rupture geometry at hypocentral depths (Colorado, USA).

For this review, we created a database of potential biomarkers of human presence based on literature reports on VOCs in human breath, skin emanations, blood and urine. We estimated approximate fluxes of these VOCs from the human body, and used them to predict concentrations in the vicinity of victims. We classified proposed markers in groups by potential for victim detection. The major classification discriminants were the capability of detection by portable, real-time analytical instruments and background levels of VOCs in the urban environment. We intend data summarized in this review to assist studies on the detection of humans via chemical analysis and to accelerate investigations in this area of knowledge. © 2015 The Authors.","Biomarker; Earthquake; Entrapment; Human scent; Human volatilome; Search and rescue operation; Urban environment; VOC; Volatile marker; Volatile organic compound","Bartels, S.A., VanRooyen, M.J., (2012) Lancet, 379, p. 748; (2003) United States Geological Survey; Noji, E.K., (2005) Epidemiol.

To this end, an experimental analysis was conducted on scale models of adobe houses. In one test, an arch roof was retrofitted with only a PP-band mesh. In the second test, in addition to being retrofitted with PP-band mesh, tie-bars were used for horizontal support at roof level. These two PP-band retrofitted house models and house model with tie-bars only were subjected to sinusoid loading until the point of collapse or the capacity of the shaking table was exceeded. Results collected during the analyses were significant in assessing the capability of these retrofitting methods to support dynamic loads, increasing the collapse load, stiffness and ductility and dissipate energy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Adobe;

Bol’shaya Gruzinskaya 10, Moscow, Russian Federation","The records from wideband IRIS stations after a strong earthquake are analyzed. A few days after the earthquake, pulsations with a period of 128 min arise and last for about a week. They appear as a periodical variation in the amplitude of the free radial oscillation of the Earth <inf>0</inf>S<inf>0</inf> having a period of 20.46 min. The period of the pulsations is more than double the period of the lowest-frequency free spheroidal oscillations of the Earth (53.9 min). The pulsations are most pronounced at the mid-latitudinal and equatorial stations and less distinct near the poles. The pulsations are phase synchronous at the nearby stations and antiphase at the stations located in the western and eastern hemispheres. The pulsation amplitude does not depend on the phase of the Earth’s tide. The shape and period of the pulsations are fitted by the model of beatings appearing in the Van der Pol oscillator with periodic forcing. The pulsations are hypothesized to result from asynchronous interaction between the free oscillations of the Earth. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,"Anishchenko, V.S., Vadivasova, T.E., (2011) Lektsii po nelineinoi dinamike, , NITs “Regulyarnaya i Khaoticheskaya Dinamika, Moscow-Izhevsk: (Lectures on Nonlinear Dynamics); Benioff, H., Orogenesis and deep crustal structure—additional evidence from seismology (1954) Geol.

Characteristic hydrocarbons, such as short-chain n-alkanes, pristane, and phytane, were detected only in soil layers 0–2 cm below the tsunami deposits at both sites. Dinosterol originated from dinoflagellates was detected in a mud layer overlying sand deposits in Odaka. Such characteristic biomarkers were not detected in soil layers deeper than 2 cm beneath the tsunami deposits at either site, and none was found in the surface soil layer overlying the tsunami deposit in Odaka. Therefore, it is probable that the biomarkers were transported and deposited by the tsunami. The sand layer was highly permeable and low in clay or organic matter to which biomarkers could bind. Any biomarkers deposited with the sand probably leached into the underlying soil or were found in sediments richer in clay and organic matter such as tsunamigenic mud. Sediment samples were collected more than 2 years after the tsunami, indicating that the marine-sourced biomarkers were preserved for at least 2 years in the soil. In addition, a comparative analysis of sediment samples collected earlier indicated that characteristic biomarkers did not remain in the sand layer 3 months after the tsunami. These findings show the potential of using biomarkers as proxies to identify marine-sourced deposits on coastal land. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami; Biomarker; Dinosterol; Hydrocarbon; Northeast Japan; Tsunami deposits","Abe, H., Sugeno, Y., Chigama, A., Estimation of the height of the Sanriku Jogan 11 earthquake-tsunami (AD 869) in the Sendai Plain (1990) J Seismol Soc Jpn (Zishin), 43, pp. 513-525. , (in Japanese with English abstract); Abe, T., Goto, K., Sugawara, D., Relationship between the maximum extent of tsunami sand and the inundation limit of the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami on the Sendai Plain, Japan (2012) Sediment Geol, 282, pp. 142-150; Alpar, B., Ünlü, S., Altınok, Y., Özer, N., Aksu, A., New approaches in assessment of tsunami deposits in Dalaman (SW Turkey) (2012) Nat Hazards, 60 (1), pp. 27-41; Blumer, M., Thomas, D.W., Phytadienes in zooplankton (1965) Science, 147, pp. 1148-1149; Blumer, M., Mullin, M.M., Thomas, D.W., Pristane in zooplankton (1963) Science, 140, p. 974; Boon, J.J., Rijpstra, W.I.C., Lange, F.D., Leeuw, J.W.D., Yoshioka, M., Shimizu, Y., Black Sea sterol—a molecular fossil for dinoflagellate blooms (1979) Nature, 277, pp. 125-127; Chagué-Goff, C., Andrew, A., Szczuciński, W., Goff, J., Nishimura, Y., Geochemical signatures up to the maximum inundation of the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami—implications for the 869AD Jogan and other palaeotsunamis (2012) Sediment Geol, 282, pp. 65-77; Chagué-Goff, C., Niedzielski, P., Wong, H.K.Y., Szczuciński, W., Sugawara, D., Goff, J., Environmental impact assessment of the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami on the Sendai Plain (2012) Sediment Geol, 282, pp. 175-187; Chagué-Goff, C., Wong, H.K.Y., Sugawara, D., Goff, J., Nishimura, Y., Beer, J., Szczuciński, W., Goto, K., Impact of tsunami inundation on soil salinisation: up to 1 year after the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami (2014) Tsunami events and lessons learned: ecological and societal significance, pp. 193-214. , Kontar YA, Santiago-Fandiño V, Takahashi T, (eds), Springer, Berlin:; Chandrasekharan, H., Sarangi, A., Nagarajan, M., Singh, V.P., Rao, D.U.M., Stalin, P., Natarajan, K., Anbazhagan, S., Variability of soil–water quality due to Tsunami-2004 in the coastal belt of Nagapattinam district, Tamilnadu (2008) J Environ Manag, 89, pp. 63-72; Conte, M.H., Volkman, J.K., Eglinton, G., Lipid biomarkers of the haptophyta (1994) The haptophyte algae, pp. 351-377. , Green JC, Leadbeater BSC, (eds), Clarendon Press, Oxford:; Dean, W.J., Determination of carbonate and organic matter in calcareous sediments and sedimentary rocks by loss on ignition: comparison with other methods (1974) J Sediment Petrol, 44 (1), pp. 242-248; Eglinton, G., Hamilton, R.J., The distributions of alkanes (1963) Chemical plant taxonomy, pp. 187-217. , Swan T, (ed), Academic Press, California:; Gelpi, E., Schneider, H., Mann, J., Oró, J., Hydrocarbons of geochemical significance in microscopic algae (1970) Phytochemistry, 9, pp. 603-612; Goto, K., Chagué-Goff, C., Fujino, S., Goff, J., Jaffe, B., Nishimura, Y., Richmond, B., Yulianto, E., New insights of tsunami hazard from the 2011 Tohoku-oki event (2011) Mar Geol, 290 (1-4), pp. 46-50; Goto, K., Sugawara, D., Abe, T., Haraguchi, T., Fujino, S., Liquefaction as an important source of the AD 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami deposits at Sendai Plain, Japan (2012) Geology, 40 (10), pp. 887-890; Goto, K., Sugawara, D., Ikema, S., Miyagi, T., Sedimentary processes associated with sand and boulder deposits formed by the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami at Sabusawa Island, Japan (2012) Sediment Geol, 282, pp. 188-198; Gough, M.A., Rowland, S.J., Characterization of unresolved complex mixtures of hydrocarbons in petroleum (1990) Nature, 344, pp. 648-650; Ikan, R., Baedecker, M.J., Kaplan, I.R., Thermal alteration experiments on organic matter in recent marine sediment–II isoprenoids (1975) Geochim Cosmochim Acta, 39 (2), pp. 187-194; Jagodziński, R., Sternal, B., Szczuciński, W., Chagué-Goff, C., Sugawara, D., Heavy minerals in the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami deposits–insights into sediment sources and hydrodynamics (2012) Sediment Geol, 282, pp. 57-64; Kume, T., Umetsu, C., Palanisami, K., Impact of the December 2004 tsunami on soil, groundwater and vegetation in the Nagapattinam district, India (2009) J Environ Manag, 90, pp. 3147-3154; Mackie, P.R., Whittle, K.J., Hardy, R., Hydrocarbons in the marine environment I. n-Alkanes in the firth of clyde (1974) Estuar Coast Mar Sci, 2 (4), pp. 359-374; Marlowe, I.T., Green, J.C., Neal, A.C., Brassell, S.C., Eglinton, G., Course, P.A., Long chain (n-C<inf>37</inf>–C<inf>39</inf>) alkenones in the Prymnesiophyceae.

The basic bare SMRF was reduced in strength first and then enhanced by installing passive energy dissipating devices (EDDs) to develop modified frame. Passive EDDs comprise both rate-dependent and rate-independent devices. Viscous fluid damper (VFD) is a rate-dependent device whereas buckling-restrained brace is a rate-independent device. The lateral strength of structure was improved by using these devices either alone or in combination. Seven-scaled time-history records were used for incremental dynamic analysis. The stiffness effect on the stories is demonstrated through the lateral displacement profile of the building. The VFD is found to be a good EDD as it significantly improved the performance of the frame at all levels of seismic analysis. © 2015 The Institution of Engineers, Singapore","buckling-restrained brace; passive energy dissipation devices; seismic vulnerability assessment; steel moment-resisting frame; viscous fluid damper",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929000322

This paper describes the design, development and application of a conceptual foundation for a quantitative integrated coastal element vulnerability assessment using the up to date Source-Pathway-Receptor-Consequence (SPRC) approach. It is a conceptual model that combines a well-established approach in the field of waste and pollution management with the possibility of introducing the concept of system diagrams. Through the implementation of hazard classification, the approach leads to critical facilities identification and the loss estimation for specific hazards when different types of buildings are selected. In the example of Cayman Islands, the presence of exposed elements at risk, as the port or the airport, named critical facilities, drives serious potential damage effects due to high winds and storm surge. This approach provides both a spatial data infrastructure design, for collecting, storing and managing critical facilities information and a vulnerability assessment procedures for structural and operational components, concerning coastal zones affected by hurricane and related hazards. The final part of the paper synthesizes the conceptual treatment of coastal vulnerability in the Grand Cayman Island and underlines the ready-to-use GIS based vulnerability methodologies for risk assessment allowing to build capacity and resilience of the local communities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Anderson, M.G., The efficacy of a programme of landslide risk reduction in areas of unplanned housing in the Eastern Caribbean (2010) Environ.

A finite element model is developed for estimating the axial pipe strain and relative joint displacement of segmented pipelines. The model accounts for the effects of peak ground strain, shear transfer between soil and pipeline, axial stiffness of the pipeline, joint characteristics of the pipeline, and variability of the joint capacity and stiffness. For engineering applications, simplified analytical equations are developed for estimating the maximum pipe strain and relative joint displacement. The finite element and analytical solutions show that the segmented pipeline is relatively flexible with respect to ground deformation induced by seismic waves and deforms together with the ground. The ground strain within each pipe segmental length is shared by the joint displacement and pipe barrel strain. When the maximum ground strain is higher than 0.001, the pipe barrel strain is relatively small and can be ignored. The relative joint displacement of the segmented pipeline is mainly affected by the variability of the joint pullout capacity and accumulates at locally weak joints. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Finite element methods; Joint displacement; Segmented pipelines; Seismic waves; Soil-structure interaction","Manson, M., Connick, H.D.H., Ransom, T.W., Robinson, W.C., (1908) Reports on an auxiliary water supply system for fire protection for San Francisco, California, , Britton and Rey, San Francisco, CA; Hamada, M., O'Rourke, T.D., (1992) Case studies of liquefaction and lifeline performance during past earthquakes, 1. , NCEER-92-0001, National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research, Buffalo, NY; Sun, S., Shien, L., (1983) Analysis of seismic damage to buried pipelines in tangshan earthquake. earthquake behavior and safety of oil and gas storage facilities, buried pipelines and equipment, PVP-77, pp. 365-367. , ASME, New York; Ayala, A.G., O'Rourke, M.J., (1989) Effects of the 1985 Michoacan earthquake on water system and other buried lifelines in Mexico City, , Technical Report NCEER-89-0009, Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research, Buffalo, NY; O'Rourke, T.D., Geohazards and large geographically distributed systems (2010) Geotechnique, pp. 503-543; O'Rourke, T.D., Jeon, S.S., Toprak, S., Cubrinovski, M., Hughes, M., van Ballegooy, S., Bouziou, D., Earthquake response of underground pipeline networks in Christchurch, NZ (2014) Earthquake Spectra, 30 (1), pp. 183-204; Jeon, S.S., O'Rourke, T.D., Northridge earthquake effects on pipelines and residential buildings (2005) Bull.

Although risk tools are well-established at operational levels, approaches at the strategic level are rarely informed by systemic assessments of the water supply and lack a long-term perspective. Here, we report a baseline strategic risk analysis, founded on a systemic analysis of operational risks developed 'bottom-up' and validated in a large water utility. Deploying an action-oriented research method, supported by semi- structured interviews with in-house water utility risk experts, deep connections are established between operational risk and strategic risk that surpass those existing elsewhere in the sector. Accessible presentational formats - influence diagrams, risk ""heat-maps"" and supporting narratives are used to promote Board-level risk discussions, and characterise a baseline set of strategic risks core to forward utility master planning. Uniquely, the influence of operational events, exposures and potential harms, together with the mitigating measures in place to mediate these risks are linked to corporate objectives on business sustainability, profitability, water quality, water quantity, supply disruption and reputation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cognitive mapping; Interdependent risks; Master planning; Strategic risk analysis","Allan, R., Mauelshagan, C., Luís, A.M., Jeffrey, P., Pollard, S., Making risk management stick: reflections on risk governance in water utilities (2013) Water Contamination Emergencies: Managing the Threats, pp. 33-46. , RSC Publishing, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, U.

This paper investigates duration effect of ground motions on ductility and hysteretic energy dissipation demands on structures. Spectrally equivalent ground motions were first generated from historical records to decouple the effect of duration from those caused by other characteristics of ground motions. The spectrally equivalent ground motions were then grouped into the Short-Duration (SD) and Long-Duration (LD) suites based their significant durations for Response History Analyses (RHA) of elastic-perfectly plastic Single Degree of Freedom Systems (SDOFS). Results from RHA show that ground motion duration has a negligible influence on the central tendency of ductility demands but a significant impact on that of hysteretic energy dissipation demands. Statistical evaluations and hypothesis tests further demonstrate that the LD ground motions lead to higher hysteretic energy dissipation demands but exert similar level of ductility demands on structures in comparison with the SD ground motions. With the result database from RHA, an empirical model was developed to consider the effect of ground motion duration on hysteretic energy dissipation demands. The empirical model was then integrated into the Park-Ang damage index for determination of the required ductility capacity for a system. Results from parametric analyses show that the empirical model provides reasonable estimates of required ductility capacity. Results from RHA were also used to evaluate adequacy of the FEMA 461 quasi-static cyclic loading protocol for seismic performance evaluation. It was found for elastic-perfectly plastic SDOFS that the FEMA 461 quasi-static cyclic loading protocol is sufficient to exert the hysteretic energy dissipation demands due to SD ground motions but may be inadequate for consideration of the hysteretic energy dissipation demands due to LD ground motions. © 2015.","Ductility; Ground motion duration; Hysteretic energy; Seismic demands","(2004), Part 1: general rules, seismic actions and rules for buildingsIervolino, I., De Luca, F., Cosenza, E., Spectral shape-based assessment of SDOF nonlinear response to real, adjusted and artificial accelerograms (2010) Eng Struct, 32, pp. 2776-2792; (2010), American Society of Civil Engineers(2006), ASCE/SEI 41-06.
