Reforestation could affect responses of litter decomposition to warming by altering litter type and soil conditions. However, less is known about the interactive impacts of forest management and climate change on litter decomposition. Here, we conducted a 4-year field experiment to investigate the effects of experimental warming on the decomposition of dragon spruce ( Picea asperata Mast.) and red birch ( Betula albo-sinensis Burk.) foliar litter in two contrasting sites (a dragon spruce plantation and a natural forest) using litter-bag method on the eastern Tibetan Plateau of China. During the four years of decomposition in the field, a clear pattern of faster mass loss was observed in red birch litter compared to dragon spruce needle. Additionally, regardless of warming regimes and litter types, mass loss rates were higher in the natural forest site than in the plantation site. Warming did not affect mass loss of dragon spruce litter during the early decomposition stage, but increased it over the later decomposition stage. In contrast, warming had enhanced mass loss of red birch litter on most sampling days. Red birch litter was more sensitive to warming compared with dragon spruce needle. Our results clearly indicated that reforestation can alter litter quality and soil conditions, and further affect the litter decomposition of subalpine forest ecosystem to projected climatic warming. This calls for incorporating forest management practice in climate-carbon models to better understand carbon dynamics of forest ecosystems under climate change. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Experimental warming; Litter decomposition; Natural forest; Plantation; Reforestation; Tibetan Plateau","Aerts, R., Climate, leaf litter chemistry and leaf litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems: a triangular relationship (1997) Oikos, 79, pp. 439-449; Aerts, R., De Caluwe, H., Nutritional and plant-mediated controls on leaf litter decomposition of Carex species (1997) Ecol., 78, pp. 244-260; Aerts, R., The freezer defrosting: global warming and litter decomposition rates in cold biomes (2006) J.

Within a spring-sown wheat crop, we artificially increased temperature by 2. °C and precipitation by 10% in a short-term (April to August 2013) replicated open-field experiment and examined the impacts on coleopteran (mainly Carabidae) diversity and 'activity-densities'. Diversity indices decreased as a result of warming but were not affected by extra precipitation. We found a significant increase in activity-densities of the four most trapped species due to warming, which was responsible for observed changes in diversity. However, Staphylinidae beetles were negatively affected by the warming treatments while other, less common species were not affected. We provide the first experimental evidence of climate-driven impacts on an important farmland insect community. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of biological control and top-down effects across trophic levels. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Agro-ecosystem; Biocontrol; Carabidae; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Global warming","Altermatt, F., Climatic warming increases voltinism in European butterflies and moths (2010) Proc.

The caterpillars of autumnal and winter moths have episodic outbreaks, which can occasionally lead to extensive defoliation of birch forests. Earlier studies have shown that reindeer have a negative effect on the regeneration of defoliated birches by grazing and browsing their seedlings and sprouts. Case description: We interviewed 15 reindeer herders in the Kaldoaivi and Paistunturi herding co-operative in northernmost Finland in order to analyse their past, present and future views on the behaviour of moths and the growth of mountain birches. We investigate the behaviour of the two herbivores by combining the indigenous knowledge (IK) of Sámi herders with the results of relevant studies in biology and anthropology, applying niche construction theory (NCT) in doing so. Discussion and evaluation: In the first stage, the niche constructors (moths, reindeer, herders, mountain birch and other organisms) are looked upon as “equal constructors” of a shared niche. As changes unfold in their niche, their role changes from that of constructor to key constructor. The role and importance of niche constructors were different when nomadic pasture rotation was used than they are today under the herding co-operative system. Niche construction faced its most radical and permanent negative changes during the border closures that took place over the latter half of the 19th century. The large-scale nomadic life among the Sámi herders, who migrated between Finland and Norway, came to an end. This phase was followed by stationary herding, which diminished the possibilities of reindeer to look for various environmental affordances. Difficult snow conditions or birch defoliation caused by moth outbreaks made the situation worse than before. Eventually reindeer became key constructors, together with moth larvae, leading to negative ecological inheritance that forced herders to use new, adaptive herding practices. Conclusions: Both the scientific data and the IK of herders highlight the roles of reindeer and herders as continuous key constructors of the focal niche, one which stands to be modified in more heterogenic ways than earlier due to global warming and hence will result in new ecological inheritance. © 2015, Vuojala-Magga and Turunen; licensee Springer.","Autumnal moth; Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii; Climate change; Global warming; Indigenous knowledge (IK); Mountain birch destruction; Niche construction theory (NCT); Professional knowledge; Reindeer herding; Winter moth","Ammunét, T., (2011) Trophic interactions of invasive forest herbivores and consequences for resident ecosystem.

This interpretation relies mainly on cosmic-ray exposure dating of glacial deposits. Recent studies, however, have established new production rates for cosmogenic Be and He, which make it necessary to update all chronologies in this region and revise our understanding of cryospheric responses to climate variability. Here we present a new Be moraine chronology in Colombia showing that glaciers in the northern tropical Andes expanded to a larger extent during the Antarctic cold reversal (14,500 to 12,900 years ago) than during the Younger Dryas. On the basis of a homogenized chronology of all Be and He moraine ages across the tropical Andes, we show that this behaviour was common to the northern and southern tropical Andes. Transient simulations with a coupled global climate model suggest that the common glacier behaviour was the result of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation variability superimposed on a deglacial increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. During the Antarctic cold reversal, glaciers advanced primarily in response to cold sea surface temperatures over much of the Southern Hemisphere. During the Younger Dryas, however, northern tropical Andes glaciers retreated owing to abrupt regional warming in response to reduced precipitation and land-surface feedbacks triggered by a weakened Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Conversely, glacier retreat during the Younger Dryas in the southern tropical Andes occurred as a result of progressive warming, probably influenced by an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Considered with evidence from mid-latitude Andean glaciers, our results argue for a common glacier response to cold conditions in the Antarctic cold reversal exceeding that of the Younger Dryas. ©2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Fucus vesiculosus L. (Phaeophyceae) is the most abundant and hence ecologically most important primary producer, carbon sink and habitat provider in the western Baltic Sea. Therefore, we used this keystone species to test phenotypic acclimation of physiological performance traits (growth, photosynthesis and metabolites) of F. vesiculosus apices in a well-defined and highly resolved temperature gradient (5-29. °C), supported by highly temporally resolved measurements. Temperature requirements of growth and photosynthesis were evaluated in three weeks exposure experiments, and changing tolerance ranges for survival over time were determined. Fucus vesiculosus was able to grow and survive over a temperature range from 5 to 26. °C without any injury or visible damage of the apical growing meristem over all three weeks. However, at higher water temperatures (≥ 27 °C) growth rapidly decreased from day three onwards and progressive necrosis was observed at 28 and 29. °C. Stress-induced decrease in growth rate was already indicated by the effective quantum yield of chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II (PSII) several days in advance. Optimal temperature for photosynthesis (24. °C), measured as electron transport rate, was higher compared to that for growth (15-20. °C). Accordingly, the concentration of mannitol, the main product of photosynthesis, increased with higher temperatures. Understanding physiological responses of keystone macroalgae with respect to temperature and time is important, because rising global temperatures and summer heat wave frequencies and duration may affect the ecological functions of F. vesiculosus in the western Baltic Sea. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Global warming; Mannitol; PAM; Seaweeds","Adey, W.H., The effects of light and temperature on growth rates in boreal-subarctic crustose corallines (1970) J Phycol, 6, pp. 269-276; Andersen, G.S., Pedersen, M.F., Nielsen, S.L., Temperature acclimation and heat tolerance of photosynthesis in Norwegian Saccharina latissima (Laminariales, Phaeophyceae) (2013) J.

However, the direct warming effects on microbial communities are uncertain due to the confounding effects of plant traits and soil heterogeneities. Here, we exposed alpine meadow soil microcosms to temperature between 10 and 40. °C for 28 days, to evaluate the temperature relationship of the bacterial community structure and microbial functions. Our results showed that sustained exposure to contrasting temperature produced compositionally and functionally distinct microbial communities. The degree of these changes was dependent on the magnitude of warming, as shown by a consistent increase in the dissimilarities and a shift of the carbon (C) use pattern along the temperature gradient. We found that the bacterial community temporal dynamics followed a gradual process of succession, and the turnover rate was substantially accelerated (. P=. 0.012) by warmer temperatures; every 1. °C elevation in soil temperature was estimated to increase the turnover by 0.001. Consistently, contrasting temperature was found to be the dominant factor explained 6.1% of the total variation of the microbial community structures; however, the incubation duration and the interaction between incubation temperature and duration explained 5.4% and 4.1% of the variation, respectively. As anticipated, the shift in bacterial community rapidly translated to a similar change in enzymes activities and C utilization. In addition, potential indicator species were screened; these species characterized the temperature gradient. Collectively, our findings indicate that direct warming effects on soil bacterial community could substantially alter certain function and that contrasting temperatures would accelerate the bacterial community turnover-temperature relationship in this alpine meadow soil. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Bacterial community; Contrasting temperature; Indicator species; Temperature relationship; Turnover rate","Allison, S.D., Martiny, J.B., Resistance, resilience, and redundancy in microbial communities (2008) Proc.

In the literature, there are different methodologies for its modeling, but this study suggests the harmonic analysis application to solar irradiation and sunshine duration data for more refined relevant prediction of solar irradiation. The basis of the methodology is combined application of the HARmonic and the classical LINear regression analyses, and therefore, it is referred to as the HarLin model. It isolates first the periodicity from the daily averages of records and then the linear regression analysis is applied elegantly to first order stationary data. The results are tested and compared with the Adaptive-Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model based on the Sugeno fuzzy logic inference system and Angström-Prescott model in the form of a linear regression analysis. In the application, three solar irradiation sites are considered from different solar energy potential locations in Turkey, namely, at Adana, Gaziantep and Silifke cities. The predictions by the HarLin model appear more successful than ANFIS and the classical Angström-Prescott approaches. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","ANFIS model; Angström-Prescott equation; Harmonic analysis; Solar irradiation; Sunshine duration","Akinoğlu, B.G., Ecevit, A., Construction of a quadratic model using modified Angström coefficients to estimate global solar radiation (1990) Sol Energy, 45, pp. 85-92; Almorox, J., Bocco, M., Willington, E., Estimation of daily global solar radiation from measured temperatures at Cañada de Luque, Córdoba, Argentina (2013) Renew Energy, 60, pp. 382-387; Amato, U., Andretta, A., Banoli, B., Coluzzi, B., Cuomo, V., Fontana, F., Markov processes and Fourier analysis as a tool describe and simulate daily solar irradiance (1986) Sol Energy, 37 (3), pp. 179-194; Angström, A., Solar terrestrial radiation (1924) QJ R Meteorological Soc, 50, pp. 121-126; Baldasano, J.M., Clar, J., Berna, A., Fourier analaysis of daily solar radiation data in Spain (1988) Sol Energy, 41 (4), pp. 327-334; Balling, R., Cerveny, R.S., Spatial and temporal variations in long-term normal percent possible solar radiation levels in the United States (1983) JClim Appl Met, 22, pp. 1726-1732; Benghanem, M., Mellit, A., Alamri, S.N., ANN-based modelling and estimation of daily global solar radiation data: a case study (2009) Energy Convers Manag, 50, pp. 1644-1655; Chen, S.X., Gooi, H.B., Wang, M.Q., Solar radiation forecast based on fuzzy logic and neural networks (2013) Renew Energy, 60, pp. 195-201; Dogniaux, R., Lemoine, M., Classification of radiation sites in terms of different indices of atmospheric transparency (1983) Solar energy data.

Although anti-desertification efforts have been mounted worldwide, most undertakings have shown poor performance because of failure to consider soil and geotechnical aspects. Soil erosion is accelerated by reductions in soil cohesion and water retention due to the transfer of fine particles from the original ground. Thus, soil internal cohesion must be recovered to ensure effective and reliable anti-desertification attempts. In this study, soil treatment using biopolymers is suggested as an alternative method to prevent soil erosion and for revitalization, taking into consideration engineering and environmental aspects. Even as a relatively small part of the soil mass (i.e., 0.5-1.0%), biopolymers in soil have the positive potential to significantly reduce the erodibility of soil by enhancing inter-particle cohesion. Moreover, biopolymer treatment also improves both vegetation germination and soil water retention characteristics against evaporation, and therefore can provide suitable environments for plants and crops used as a desertification countermeasure in arid and semi-arid regions where annual precipitation is limited. We suggest combining biopolymers with pre-existing anti-desertification efforts (e.g., afforestation and windbreaks) on desert fronts (i.e., boundaries between arid and semi-arid regions) for best efficiency. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Anti-desertification; Biopolymer; Desertification; Soil erosion; Vegetation growth","Agassi, M., Ben-Hur, M., Stabilizing steep slopes with soil conditioners and plants (1992) Soil Technol., 5 (3), pp. 249-256; Al-Darby, A.M., The hydraulic properties of a sandy soil treated with gel-forming soil conditioner (1996) Soil Technol., 9 (1-2), pp. 15-28; Balba, A.M., (1995) Management of Problem Soils in Arid Ecosystems, , CRC Press; (2013) Biodegradable Polymers, , BCC Research; Ben-Hur, M., Letey, J., Effect of polysaccharides, clay dispersion, and impact energy on water infiltration (1989) Soil Sci.

However, this process consumes high amounts of non-renewable energy, such as natural gas (NG) and coke. Due to fossil fuel scarcity and global warming issues, at least partial substitution for renewable energy is desirable. Biomass gasification projects are being successfully developed in Northern Europe and large-scale circulating fluidized bed (CFB) biomass gasifiers have been commissioned. This work compares different technologies, such as CFB air and oxygen gasification, dual fluidized bed (DFB) steam gasification, and bio-synthetic natural gas (bio-SNG) production, focusing on the use of the product gas in an iron ore pelletizing process located in the Southeast of Brazil. The main parameters evaluated were flame temperature and gaseous flow rates. Economical evaluation was also performed. Air gasification provided a product gas with the lowest energy content but it was the most attractive investment. Oxygen gasification is apparently the best option as it provides a product gas with higher heating value at almost the same cost as air gasification.

The availability of inorganic carbon in the photobioreactor, determined by its supply in the wastewater and microalgae activity, governed the extent of nitrogen removal by assimilation or nitrification-denitrification. Unexpectedly, nitrate production was negligible despite the high dissolved oxygen concentrations, denitrification being only based on nitrite reduction. Biomass recycling resulted in the enrichment of rapidly settling algal flocs, which supported effluent total suspended solid concentrations below the European Union maximum discharge limits. Finally, the maximum nitrous oxide emissions recorded were far below the emission factors reported for wastewater treatment plants, confirming the environmental sustainability of this innovative photobioreactor in terms of global warming impact. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Algal-bacterial symbiosis; Dissimilatory nitrogen removal; Enhanced sedimentation; Inorganic carbon competition; Nitrous oxide emissions","Alcántara, C., Muñoz, R., Norvill, Z., Plouviez, M., Guieysse, B., Nitrous oxide emissions from high rate algal ponds treating domestic wastewater (2015) Bioresour.

In addition, salinity has been decreasing in high latitudes and is expected to continue decreasing due to altered precipitation patterns and glacial melting caused by climate change. Many marine organisms that are adapted to the present conditions may be drastically affected by these oceanic changes. Early life stages (larvae and juveniles) should be especially susceptible, since they do not yet have the fully developed morphological defenses of adults. This study investigated the effects of reduced salinity (20 compared to a control of 30) and altered temperature (15, 20, 25, and 29. °C) on the growth, percent inorganic content (representing shell calcification), and feeding rates of larvae and juveniles of the widespread coastal snail Crepidula fornicata. Both larval and juvenile growth rates were significantly depressed at low salinity and lower temperatures. In addition, the salinity that snails were exposed to as larvae significantly impacted their juvenile growth rates in 4 out of 6 treatments, an example of latent effects. The magnitude and direction of this effect were strongly impacted by temperature and parentage. Juvenile feeding rates were significantly depressed following a rapid change in salinity but then gradually recovered to near initial levels over 3. h. There was little difference in the percent inorganic content of juveniles but for larvae that had been reared at 20. °C, percent inorganic content was 27% lower for those reared at a salinity of 20 compared with those reared at 30. In conclusion, the early life stages of C. fornicata may experience more favorable conditions in a warmer future: growth rates will increase, probably making larvae and juveniles less vulnerable to size-specific predation. Conversely, in regions where salinity is decreasing, C. fornicata larvae and juveniles will likely grow more slowly, thereby increasing predation risk by forcing them to spend more time at more vulnerable smaller sizes. Thus, the future of C. fornicata and their potential to continue invading new habitats will depend greatly on the specific salinity and temperature conditions they will be exposed to throughout larval and juvenile development. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Crepidula; Juvenile; Larva; Latent effects; Salinity; Temperature","Almada-Villela, P.C., The effects of reduced salinity on the shell growth of small Mytilus edulis (1984) J.

The aim of this study was to determine if the natural temperature gradient experienced by P. sedentaria results in a thermal stress response. Individuals were initially exposed to their night time temperatures (23. °C) and subsequently subjected to temperatures within and above the range they typically experience. In the Eastern Tropical North Pacific P. sedentaria tolerates its normal night-time temperature (~. 23. °C), but only for the duration of its stay there (~. 9. h). Longer exposures (24. h) result in elevated heat shock protein (hsp) expression. 29. °C results in hsp expression, increased lactate production and 50% mortality at all exposure durations. This represents an upper critical temperature. Understanding the adaptations of pelagic amphipods to their current environment will help predict the physiological impacts of global warming for amphipods and their predators. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Critical temperature; Diel vertical migration; Hsp70; Hyperiid amphipod; Oxygen limited thermal tolerance; Phronima; Thermal stress","Bedulina, D., Zimmer, M., Timofeyev, M., Sub-littoral and supra-littoral amphipods respond differently to acute thermal stress (2010) Comp.

The transportation technologies based on cleaner and renewable alternative fuels can play a major role in mitigating the green house effect and improving the urban air quality. In the present work, a hybrid multicriteria methodology is developed using graph theory and analytic hierarchy process methods for the performance assessment of conventional and non-conventional transportation fuels on the basis of multiple criteria. The proposed fuel suitability digraph presents a graphical visualization of alternative fuel selection attributes and their interrelations. The fuel preference index obtained from matrix permanent function provides a total objective value for comparison of alternative fuel options. Analytic hierarchy process is employed to assign the relative weights to the fuel selection attributes.

Although both climatic and biotic stressors have been studied separately, much less is known on how drought and pathogens interact and induce dieback, particularly in formerly used forests. We determine the roles played by each of those drivers as factors causing recent dieback in three Pyrenean silver fir stands: a managed site subjected to past logging and two unmanaged sites not logged for the past 50 years. The age, size, recent competition, and basal-area increment (BAI) trends of non-declining and declining trees, and the presence of fungal pathogens were investigated. Growth patterns at yearly to decadal time scales were compared to distinguish the roles and interactions played by the different stressors. In the managed site, declining trees displayed low growth already before logging (1950-1970s). In both unmanaged sites, declining and non-declining trees displayed divergent growth patterns after extreme droughts, indicating that dieback was triggered by severe water deficit. We did not find indications that fungal pathogens are the primary drivers of dieback, since a low proportion of declining trees were infested by primary pathogens (10%). However, trees with the primary fungal pathogen Heterobasidion showed lower BAI than non-declining trees. On the other hand, the secondary fungal pathogen Amylostereum was isolated from a higher number of trees than expected by chance. These findings highlight the importance of legacies, such as the past use in driving recent forest dieback. Past forest use could predispose to dieback by selecting slow-growing trees and thus, making some them more vulnerable to drought and fungal pathogens. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Abies alba; Climate warming; Dencroecology; Drought stress; Forest die-off; Root-rot fungi","Adams, H.D., Guardiola-Claramonte, M., Barron-Gafford, G.A., Villegas, J.C., Breshears, D.D., Zou, C.B., Troch, P.A., Huxman, T.E., Temperature sensitivity of drought-induced tree mortality portends increased regional die-off under global-change-type drought (2009) Proc.

Understanding the high-latitude reef-growth process and its correlation to climate change may provide important insights into future reef growth at even higher latitudes in response to global warming. We conducted field surveys and obtained seven cores from the raised reefs of Kodakara Island (29°N, 129°E) in the NWP to determine the changes in and response of reef growth dynamics to millennial-scale climate change through the Holocene. To reconstruct the timing of the reef growth, 37 coral ages were determined using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating. The island is characterized by three Holocene reef terraces (Terraces I to III), which were uplifted ca. 2.4 ka, 1.0-0.4 ka, and in the modern era. Three growth hiatuses occurred circa 5.9-5.8 ka, 4.4-4.0 ka, and 3.3-3.2 ka, which correlate with millennial-scale climate changes (Hamanaka et al., 2012). The reef growth began at least 8ka. Relatively rapid vertical growth of 3.6-3.3m kyr-1 occurred between 8 and 6ka. The reef started growing near land and then gradually extended seaward. The reef growth around the reef slope decelerated after 6ka and most likely coincided with the first and second hiatuses detected landward. In contrast with the reef flat, which resumed its growth after the third hiatus event, the reef mound accretion on the slope ceased definitively. Terrace I was uplifted ca. 2.4 ka. The reef growth reactivated ca. 1.3 ka, and the reef grew at a rate of 9.1m kyr-1 between 1.3 and 1.0 ka; this rate is the fastest growth recorded in this study. This time interval corresponds to the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA). The cause of the delayed reef growth between 2.4 and 1.4 ka remains unclear, but it may imply the existence of a late Holocene hiatus due to a weaker Kuroshio Current (KC) ca. 1.7ka and to strong El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity between 2 and 1.5ka in the East Pacific. The timing of the hiatuses agrees with the weakening of the KC and the more frequent El Niño events during the positive phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), whereas the rapid growth coincides with La Niña conditions, such as the MCA, during the negative phase of the PDO. Our results indicate that the climate event at approximately 4. ka caused the largest change in the reef growth, and it may have affected reefs throughout the Pacific region. Specifically, the ENSO and PDO phases may have impacted the reef growth and KC behavior. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Coral reef growth; ENSO; Hiatus; Holocene; PDO; The Northwest Pacific","Baker, A.C., Glynn, P.W., Riegl, B., Climate change and coral reef bleaching: an ecological assessment of long-term impacts, recovery trends and future outlook (2008) Estuar.

Six fertilization strategies were studied, including control (CK), N fertilizer (CF), pig manure compost+N fertilizer (MC), straw+N fertilizer (SC), straw+pig manure compost+N fertilizer (SM), and straw+straw-decomposing inoculant+N fertilizer (SI). The results indicated that the application of organic amendments did not change the seasonal pattern of GHG emissions but significantly affected their seasonal quantities. Averaged over the 3 cycles, the annual SOC sequestration rates contributed significantly to the net GWPs and were estimated to be 1.01t C ha-1 yr-1 for the control and 1.13-1.27t C ha-1 yr-1 for the fertilized plots. Compared to CF, the MC strategy significantly increased SOC while had similar size of net GWP and GHGI, thus deserving recommendation regarding sustainable soil productivity and GHGs mitigations. However, the other proposed organic strategies of SC, SM, and SI significantly increased net GWP and GHGI as well as SOC thus requiring further researches for GHGs mitigations. Therefore, we recommend that the application of manure substituting half chemical fertilizer be an effective strategy while straw returning in any currently studied strategies should be re-examined in the rice-wheat annual rotation system. © 2015 .","Greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI); Net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB); Net global warming potential; Organic amendment; Rice agriculture; Soil carbon sequestration","Adviento-Borbe, M.A.A., Haddix, M.L., Binder, D.L., Soil greenhouse gas fluxes and global warming potential in four high-yielding maize systems (2007) Global Change Biol., 13 (9), pp. 1972-1988; Amin, M.G.M., Forslund, A., Bui, X.T., Persistence and leaching potential of microorganisms and mineral N in animal manure applied to intact soil columns (2013) Appl.

The overall objective of this study is to investigate known challenges related to buildings LCA such as biogenic carbon accounting and dynamic and prospective aspects, and to discuss how they affect LCA results for low energy buildings and what developments are still needed. Three single family houses built respectively with timber frame, concrete blocks cavity wall, and cast concrete are used as a case study, focusing on the global warming impact category.When biogenic carbon is addressed, the timber house is the less impacting choice, whether it is landfilled or burned at the end-of-life. The cavity wall house is the second most favourable option, and the cast concrete house is the worst one. In the case of landfilling for the timber house, the biogenic carbon balance is not neutral and worth to be considered. When a dynamic approach and specific prospective scenarios are considered, the ranking between houses stays the same, but the gaps between options vary e.g. the gap between the landfilled timber house and the cast concrete house vary from 40 % to 60 % when optimistic changes in the electricity mix are considered.Dynamic LCA allows for a more consistent analysis of emissions flows and global warming impacts over time. Prospective LCA could provide more relevant LCA results but increases uncertainty and could be used as sensitivity analysis for long life span buildings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Biogenic carbon; Building; Dynamic; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Prospective","(2012) World energy outlook 2012, , International Energy Agency, Paris; (2013) Chiffres clés de l'énergie 2013, Service de l'observation et des statistiques; Charlier, D., Risch, A., Evaluation of the impact of environmental public policy measures on energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the French residential sector (2012) Energy Policy, 46, pp. 170-184; Finnveden, G., Hauschild, M.Z., Ekvall, T., Guinée, J., Heijungs, R., Hellweg, S., Recent developments in life cycle assessment (2009) JEnviron Manage, 91, pp. 1-21; Peuportier, B., Kellenberger, D., Anink, D., Mötzl, H., Anderson, J., Vares, S., (2004) Inter-comparison and benchmarking of LCA-based environmental assessment and design tools, , Warsaw; Lasvaux, S., Ventura, A., Habert, G., De La Roche, C., Hermel, K., Feraille, A., Linking research activities and their implementation in practice in the construction sector: the LCA construction 2012 experience (2014) Int J Life Cycle Assess, 19, pp. 463-470; Blengini, G.A., Di Carlo, T., The changing role of life cycle phases, subsystems and materials in the LCA of low energy buildings (2010) Energy Build, 42, pp. 869-880; Zabalza Bribián, I., Aranda Usón, A., Scarpellini, S., Life cycle assessment in buildings: state-of-the-art and simplified LCA methodology as a complement for building certification (2009) Build Environ, 44, pp. 2510-2520; Takano, A., Hughes, M., Winter, S., Amultidisciplinary approach to sustainable building material selection: a case study in a Finnish context (2014) Build Environ, 82, pp. 526-535; Mequignon, M., Ait Haddou, H., Thellier, F., Bonhomme, M., Greenhouse gases and building lifetimes (2013) Build Environ, 68, pp. 77-86; Peuportier, B., Herfray, G., Malmqvist, T., Zabalza, I., Staller, H., Tritthart, W., Life cycle assessment methodologies in the construction sector: the contribution of the european lore-lca project (2011) Sustain.

Therefore, strengthening measures are required to ensure embankment stability. Based on in-situ observational data from the Qinghai-Xizang Railway in Beiluhe, variations in the thermal regime under a thermally insulated embankment after the implementation of strengthening measures were analysed. The results show that the strengthening measure of thermosyphon installation can play an effective role in the embankment cooling process; however, no protective effect of the spall rock revetment was observed. The shallow mean annual maximum temperature in the upper 0.5. m of soil decreased from 2.2 to 0. °C with an average of 1.8. °C, appearing as a striking ""cold energy accumulation"" process which predominantly results from thermosyphons and heat insulation material, after the strengthening measures were implemented. Meanwhile, the permafrost table under the embankment appeared as a ""second rising process"", ranging from 0.90. m for DK1139. +. 670 to 2.56. m for DK1139. +. 780, with an average of 1.66. m. The ""sunny-shady slope effect"" was not well controlled after the implementation of the strengthening measures under the embankment with thermal insulation. However, the difference in temperature between the ground and underlying permafrost table, under the left and right shoulder of the embankment, gradually decreased. Besides, thermal influence of the embankment to the surrounding permafrost in the deep layer is observed to be eliminated after the implementation of the strengthening measures. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Permafrost table; Qinghai-Xizang Railway; Second rising process; Strengthening measures","Chen, X.B., Liu, J.K., Liu, H.X., Wang, Y.Q., (2006) Frost Action of Soil and Foundation Engineering, , Science Press; Cheng, G.D., Zhang, J.M., Sheng, Y., Chen, J., Principle of thermal insulation for permafrost protection (2004) Cold Reg.

This study uses Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to compare the environmental impacts of a diesel/PV/wind hybrid microgrid on the island of Koh Jig, Thailand with the electrification alternatives of grid extension and home diesel generators. The impact categories evaluated are: acidification potential (kg SO2 eq), global warming potential (kg CO2 eq), human toxicity potential (kg 1.4 DCB eq), and abiotic resource depletion potential (kg Sb eq). The results show that the microgrid system has the lowest global warming and abiotic resource depletion potentials of all three electrification scenarios. The use phase of the diesel generator and the extraction of copper are shown to significantly contribute to the microgrid's environmental impacts. The relative environmental impacts of the grid extension scenario are found to be proportional to the distance required for grid extension. Across all categories except acidification potential, the impacts from the home diesel generators are the largest. Sensitivity analyses show that maximizing the renewable energy fraction does not necessarily produce a more environmentally sustainable electrification scenario and that the diesel generator provides versatility to the system by allowing power production to be scaled significantly before more technology is needed to meet demand. While the environmental benefits of the microgrid increase as the installation community becomes more isolated, the choice of electrification scenario requires assigning relative importance to each impact category and considering social and economic factors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","ADP; AP; CML-IA; Diesel electricity generation; GWP; HTP; Hybrid microgrid system; KMUTT; Life Cycle Assessment; Power grid extension; Renewable energy; Rural electrification development","Cook, P., Infrastructure, rural electrification and development (2011) Energy Sustain Dev, 15 (3), pp. 304-313; Mahapatra, S., Dasappa, S., Rural electrification: optimising the choice between decentralised renewable energy sources and grid extension (2012) Energy Sustain Dev, pp. 146-154; Chaurey, A., Kandpal, T.C., Assessment and evaluation of PV based decentralized rural electrification: an overview (2010) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 14 (8), pp. 2266-2278; Bala, B.K., Siddique, S., Optimal design of a PV-diesel hybrid system for electrification of an isolated island- Sandwip in Bangladesh using genetic algorithm (2009) Energy Sustain Dev, pp. 137-142; del Rio, P., Burguillo, M., An empirical analysis of renewable energy deployment on local sustainability (2009) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 13, pp. 1314-1325; Green, D., Thailand's solar white elephants: an analysis of 15 yr of solar battery charging programmes in Northern Thailand (2004) Energy Policy, 32, pp. 747-760; Greacen, C., Prasitpianchai, S., Suwannakum, T., Menke, C., (2007) Renewable energy options on islands in the Andaman Sea, , King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Report; (2011) World energy outlook 2011, , International Energy Agency, Report; Phuangpornpitak, N., Kumar, S., User acceptance of Diesel/PV hybrid system in an island community (2011) Renew Energy, 36 (1), pp. 125-131; Mini-grid system for rural electrification in the greater Mekong sub regional countries., , University of Kassel, [Thesis, Unpublished Results]; Mini-grid of renewable energy hybrid system for rural village (case study: Ko Chik village) Energy Policy and Planning Office, , [Unpublished Results]; Jorge, R.S., Hawkins, T.R., Hertwich, E.G., Life cycle assessment of electricity transmission and distribution - part 1: power lines and cables (2011) Int J Life Cycle Assess, 17, pp. 9-15; Hoffman, U., Requirements for environmentally sound and economically viable management of lead as important natural resource and hazardous waste in the wake of trade restrictions on secondary lead by decision iii/1 of the basel convention: the case of used batteries in the Phillippines (1999) United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, , [Unpublished Results]; (2006) ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, environmental management - Life cycle assessment; Wilson, F.G., (2013) Gas and diesel generators, , http://www.fgwilson.com/, Company Website; (2013), http://fortiswindenergy.com/, Company WebsiteFthenakis, V.M., Kim, H.C., Photovoltaics: life-cycle analyses (2011) Sol Energy, 85, pp. 1609-1628; (2013), http://www.prometheusinstitute.org/admin/researchnotes/uploads/PV2-0301.09_-Shell_Solar-.pdf, Prometheus Institute for Sustainable Development(2011) Wet lead acid storage batteries, , http://www.batteryenergy.com.au//content_common/pg-downloads.seo, Battery Energy Power Solutions Pty Ltd, Fairfield NSW.

Most work to date has concentrated on the effects of habitat conversion or destruction on C sequestration potential, while relatively less attention has been put on their impacts on large standing soil C pool (previously sequestered and stored soil C) associated with salt marshes. Here, we provide direct empirical evidence to determine reclamation effects on previously sequestered soil C pool in salt marshes after nine years following reclamation. Our results showed that soil moisture significantly decreased and soil microbial biomass significantly increased along with the transition from salt marshes to reclaimed lands. Meanwhile, soil respiration was three-folds higher in reclaimed lands than in salt marshes. Consequently, soil organic C pool in reclaimed lands declined to 60% (0-20cm) and 79% (0-100cm) of those in salt marshes after nine years. We may speculate that half-life of topsoil C pool of salt marshes after reclamation is approximately 10 years, and previously sequestered and stored soil C pool may decline to the minimum value within roughly 15 years. Our results suggest that a considerable proportion of previously sequestered soil C, once effectively 'locked up' in salt marshes mainly due to anaerobic conditions, is vulnerable to saltmarsh habitat loss and can be rapidly released into the atmosphere (as CO<inf>2</inf>) contributing to global warming within a short period after reclamation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Coastal wetlands; Reclamation; SOC; Soil respiration","Bai, J., Xiao, R., Zhang, K., Gao, H., Cui, B., Liu, X., Soil organic carbon as affected by land use in young and old reclaimed regions of a coastal estuary wetland, China (2013) Soil Use Manage., 29, pp. 57-64; Barbier, E.B., Hacker, S.D., Kennedy, C., Koch, E.W., Stier, A.C., Silliman, B.R., The value of estuarine and coastal ecosystem services (2011) Ecol.

However this scenario implies very large and rapid reductions in both carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) and non-CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, and suggests a need to understand available flexibility between how different greenhouse gases might be abated. There is a growing interest in developing a greater understanding of the particular role of shorter lived non-CO<inf>2</inf> gases as abatement options. We address this here through a sensitivity study of different methane (CH<inf>4</inf>) emissions pathways to year 2100 and beyond, by including exchanges with CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, and with a focus on related climate and economic advantages and disadvantages. Metrics exist that characterise gas equivalence in terms of climate change effect per tonne emitted. We analyse the implications of CO<inf>2</inf> and CH<inf>4</inf> emission exchanges under two commonly considered metrics: the 100-yr Global Warming Potential (GWP-100) and Global Temperature Potential (GTP-100). This is whilst keeping CO<inf>2</inf>-equivalent emissions pathways fixed, based on the standard set of emissions usually associated with RCP2.6. An idealised situation of anthropogenic CH<inf>4</inf> emissions being reduced to zero across a period of two decades and with the implementation of such cuts starting almost immediately gives lower warming than for standard RCP2.6 emissions during the 21st and 22nd Century. This is despite exchanging for higher CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Introducing Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC) curves provides an economic assessment of alternative gas reduction strategies. Whilst simpler than utilising full Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), MAC curves are more transparent for illustrative modelling. The GWP-100 metric places a relatively high value on climate change prevented for methane emission reduction, as compared to an equivalent mass of CO<inf>2</inf> reduction. This in combination with the strong non-linearity in MAC curves (moving quickly from relatively cheap removal to emissions difficult to cut at any cost) causes little change under cost minimisation from standard RCP2.6 emissions. This reflects the original development of RCP2.6 standard emissions from similar minimisation. With gas exchange under GTP-100, however, we find much less methane is abated, resulting in higher temperatures, whilst costs are slightly lower. Our results also highlight the point at which greater methane mitigation would become beneficial from both a climate and economic aspect. If by 2030 removal of all methane were to become possible at an average cost less than $1000 per tonne of CH<inf>4</inf>, then this would be the cheapest option, for GWP-100 metric and our CO<inf>2</inf> MAC curve. Critically this would increase the possibility of constraining warming to two degrees. © 2015 The Authors.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Climate change; Greenhouse gases; MAC curves; Methane emissions; Metrics","Aaheim, A., Costs savings of a flexible multi-gas climate policy (2006) Energy J., 3, pp. 485-502; Aamaas, B., Simple emission metrics for climate impacts (2013) Earth Syst.

Development of alternative fuels is expected to play a pivotal role during the forthcoming decades. These alternative fuels, in general, are free from green house gases, which are almost responsible for global warming among all other effects. Introduction of newer alternative fuels is surely to enhance the quality of life across the world. Use and reuse of alternative fuels to a greater extent for the benefit of our society is a great challenge as well as an opportunity for engineers. The present study aims at choosing one of the most suitable alternative fuels, which would perform well in relation to various attributes. The most appropriate fuel out of five alternatives has been chosen by using multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methodologies. Weightage of each criterion is determined by using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and ranks of the alternatives have been calculated by using MOORA and PROMETHEE methods. The alternative A<inf>4</inf>, which is Mahua blend is the most appropriate alternative fuel for this present study since it has been ranked first by both the MCDM methods. The performance of both the methods is judged by finding Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Therefore, MCDM methodologies can be utilised to select the best alternative fuel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

LCA and LCC methodologies have been here applied for a comparison with a conventional technology, i.e. Micro Gas Turbine (MGT) for distributed power generation applications. A contribution analysis for the SOFC system fuelled with natural gas, reveals that the fuel supply is responsible of a relevant share of the environmental impact. The same system, fed with biogas, shows environmental benefits on global and regional impact categories, depending on the power energy mix used during the digestion process. For both SOFC and MGT systems, the life cycle hotspots are identifiable in the operation stage for the global warming category, and in the fuel supply stage for all the remaining impact categories. The LCA-LCC comparison between SOFC and MGT systems, based on a toolbox embedding a set of 8 sustainability indicators for decision making, shows that the SOFC system presents environmental and economic benefits in a life cycle perspective, particularly for household application. However, cost results to be the most sensitive bottle-neck for benchmarking with traditional energy systems. Therefore, the SOFC system is preferable to the conventional MGT technology when the sustainability of investment cost is demonstrated, whilst a wide advantage in environmental performance along the life cycle has been proved. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The simulated volume transport by the western boundary current system in the IAS, including the Caribbean Current, Yucatan Current and Loop Current (LC), is reduced by 20-25% during the 21st century, consistent with a similar rate of reduction in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The effect of the LC in the present climate is to warm the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Therefore, the reduced LC and the associated weakening of the warm transient LC eddies have a cooling impact in the GoM, particularly during boreal spring in the northern deep basin, in agreement with an earlier dynamic downscaling study. In contrast to the reduced warming in the northern deep GoM, the downscaled model predicts an intense warming in the shallow (≤. 200. m) northeastern shelf of the GoM especially during boreal summer since there is no effective mechanism to dissipate the increased surface heating. Potential implications of the regionally distinctive warming trend pattern in the GoM on the marine ecosystems and hurricane intensifications during landfall are discussed. This study also explores the effects of 20th century warming and climate variability in the IAS using the regional ocean model forced with observed surface flux fields. The main modes of sea surface temperature variability in the IAS are linked to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and a meridional dipole pattern between the GoM and Caribbean Sea. It is also shown that variability of the IAS western boundary current system in the 20th century is largely driven by wind stress curl in the Sverdrup interior and the AMOC. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","AMO; AMOC; Caribbean current; Caribbean Sea; Climate change; Dynamical downscaling; Global warming; Gulf of Mexico; Intra-Americas Sea; Loop current","Alexander, M., Scott, J., The influence of ENSO on air-sea interaction in the Atlantic (2002) Geophys.

Estimated growth energy balance derived by scope for growth (SFG) demonstrated a deficit of growth energy reserve for M. galloprovincialis in summer at temperatures beyond 28. °C. Similarly, insufficient energy reserve for P. viridis in winter temperature below 13. °C was exhibited. Decline of summer growth energy in M. galloprovincialis at 28-29. °C was deduced to be caused by the depletion of energy supply from food ingestion suggested by the reduction of clearance rate (CR). The observed depression of SFG confirmed that the warming stress on the metabolism of M. galloprovincialis could be a reason for the currently observed population decline of M. galloprovincialis in Japanese coastal waters. In winter condition, depression of growth energy in P. viridis below 13. °C could be attributed to the reduction in both the CR and the oxygen metabolism. The depleted winter SFG in P. viridis suggested that its current expansion in Japanese coastal water might be partly controlled by metabolic energy deficiency at winter temperature and the low food concentration environment. Assuming the increase in annual average coastal water temperature due to future climate change will be 2. °C, enhancement of M. galloprovincialis mortality is inevitable, as projected summer water temperatures will exceed the ""pejus threshold"" of 28. °C and warming lethal threshold of 29. °C. In contrast, P. viridis will have advantages in its population expansion in the future warming environment due to both decreasing cold-water stress on winter growth energy reserve and large growth energy in the summer if the food environment is sufficient to compensate for enhanced metabolic energy demand in this ectotherm. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Blue mussel; Clearance rate; Global warming; Green mussel; Oxygen consumption rate","Anestis, A., lazou, A., Portner, O., Michaelidis, B., Behavioral, metabolic, and molecular stress responses of marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis during long-term acclimation at increasing ambient temperature (2007) Am.

However, this process affects the environment due to greenhouse gas emissions. By lifecycle assessment (LCA), we assessed the energy consumption (EC) and environmental impact (EI) of an integrated food waste-based biogas system and its subsystems. Data were collected from an actual plant in China that adopted a combination of wet-heat treatment and wet AD process at thermophilic condition. The EC of the system for processing 1ton of waste was 663.89MJ, among which 47.76% was from the primary treatment process (including pretreatment and AD). The GWP<inf>100</inf> (100-year global warming potential) emission of the system reached 96.97kgCO<inf>2</inf>-eq/t, and the AP (acidification potential), EP (eutrophication potential), HTP<inf>inf</inf> (human toxicity potential) and FAETP<inf>inf</inf> (fresh water ecotoxicity) emissions were low. The EI was mainly generated by two subsystems, namely, the primary treatment and the secondary pollution control. Sensitivity analysis showed that a 40% increase of the feed fat content resulted in 38% increase in the net energy value output and 48% decrease in EP effect. The increase in oil content and biogas production rate could significantly reduce the EC and EI of the system. It has been shown that improving the technology of the process and increasing the recycling rate of products will result in the reduction of EC and EI of the biogas system. In addition, a quantitative assessment model of EC and EI in integrated food waste-based biogas technology is established. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Biogas; Energy consumption; Environmental impact; Food waste; Life cycle analysis (LCA)","Gustavsson, J., Cederberg, C., Sonesson, R., van Otterdijk, R., Meybeck, A., (2011) Global food losses and food wastes: extent, cause and prevention.

The daily mean AOT at 500nm for the present study period was 0.66±0.14 with an average Angstrom exponent as 0.71±0.20. Linear regression analysis of monthly AOT and Angstrom Exponent indicated an increasing trend of both. Seasonal variations of daily AOT and α as well as spectral dependence of seasonal mean AOT are presented. Diurnal variation of AOT and α in different season is studied. Impact of dust storm events on the aerosol characteristics over Jodhpur during the study period is studied. AOT values derived from MICROTOPS II were cross checked with Sun Sky Radiometer (Model POM-01, Prede Inc.) data for the period from May 2011 to April 2012 and were found to be in good agreement. Short wave aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) was computed for one year period of May 2011 to April 2012. Spectral variation of AOT, SSA and ASP showed more AOT and ASP during pre monsoon period when SSA was comparatively low; indicating towards more prevalence of coarse size absorbing dust in this period. The ARF at SUF and TOA was negative during all the seasons indicating dominance of scattering type aerosols mainly dust particles whereas that at ATM was positive in all the seasons indicating heating of the atmosphere, especially more during pre monsoon (+40.5W/m2) than during rest of the year (+19.5W/m2). A high degree of correlation between ARF at the SUF with AOT (R2=0.94) indicated that ARF is a strong function of AOT. The radiative forcing efficiency inferred to scattering nature of aerosols at SUF (-4.2W/m2/AOD) and TOA (-63.2W/m2/AOD) indicating cooling at surface and top of the atmosphere whereas, there was warming of the atmosphere in between (+59W/m2/AOD). The atmospheric heating rates varied from 0.49K/day in post monsoon to 1.13K/day in pre monsoon. This study has enabled us to understand the long term nature and physical characteristics of atmospheric aerosols over Jodhpur. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Aerosol optical thickness; Angström exponent; Dust storm; Heating rates; Radiative forcing; Temporal variation","Alam, K., Trautmann, T., Blaschke, T., Aerosol optical properties and radiative forcing over mega city Karachi (2011) Atmos.

Arid lands of Central Asia (ALCA), one of the largest arid regions at the middle latitudes in the world, is likely to be strongly influenced by climate warming. Understanding the precipitation variations in the past is an important prerequisite for predicting future precipitation trends and thus managing regional water resources in such an arid region. In this study, we used run theory, displacement, extreme deviation theory, precipitation concentration index (PCI), Mann-Kendall rank correlation and climatic trend coefficient methods to analyze the precipitation in wet and dry years, changes in precipitation over multiple-time scales, variability of precipitation and its rate of change based on the monthly precipitation data during 1950–2000 from 344 meteorological stations in the ALCA. The occurrence probability of a single year with abundant precipitation was higher than that of a single year with less precipitation. The average duration of extreme drought in the entire area was 5 years, with an average annual water deficit of 34.6 mm (accounting for 11.2% of the average annual precipitation over the duration). The occurrence probability of a single wet year was slightly higher than that of a single dry year. The occurrence probability of more than 5 consecutive wet years was 5.8%, while the occurrence probability of more than 5 consecutive dry years was 6.2%. In the center of the study area, the distribution of precipitation was stable at an intra-annual timescale, with small changes at an inter-annual timescale. In the western part of the study area, the monthly variation of precipitation was high at an inter-annual timescale. There were clear seasonal changes in precipitation (PCI=12–36) in the ALCA. Precipitation in spring and winter accounted for 37.7% and 24.4% of the annual precipitation, respectively. There was a significant inter-annual change in precipitation in the arid Northwest China (PCI=24–34). Annual precipitation increased significantly (P=0.05) in 17.4% of all the meteorological stations over the study period. The probability of an increase in annual precipitation was 75.6%, with this increase being significant (P=0.05) at 34.0% of all the meteorological stations. The average increasing rate in annual precipitation was 3.9 mm/10a (P=0.01) in the ALCA. There were significant increasing trends (P=0.01) in precipitation in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, with rates of 2.6, 3.1 and 3.7 mm/10a, respectively. © 2015, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer - Verlag GmbH.","arid lands of Central Asia; Mann-Kendall method; precipitation; stability; tendency","Aizen, E.M., Aizen, V.B., Melack, J.M., Precipitation and atmospheric circulation patterns at mid-latitudes of Asia (2001) International Journal of Climatology, 21, pp. 535-556; Cai, M.K., Comparative study on hydrologic-meteorological-drought characteristics of Guanzhong areas (2003) Journal of Irrigation and Drainage, 22 (6), pp. 33-37; Chen, F.H., Chen, J.H., Huang, W., Discussion on “westerly mode” of climate change in the middle laltitude during the ice age (2009) Earth Science Frontiers, 16 (6), pp. 23-32; Chen, F.H., Chen, J.H., Holmes, J., Moisture changes over the last millennium in arid central Asia: a review, synthesis and comparison with monsoon region (2010) Quaternary Science Reviews, 29, pp. 1055-1068; Chen, F.H., Huang, W., Jin, L.Y., Spatiotemporal precipitation variations in the arid Central Asia in the context of global warming (2011) Science China Earth Sciences, 54 (12), pp. 1812-1821; De, L.M., Raventos, J., Gonza, J.C., Spatial analysis of rainfall trends in the region of Valencia (East Spain) (2000) International Journal of Climatology, 20, pp. 1451-1469; Feng, X.L., Feng, Z.L., Luo, L.C., Fractal analysis of climate change and Hurst index experiment in Tibetan Plateau in future (2008) Arid Land Geography, 31 (2), pp. 175-181; Hedi, O., Katerina, N., Anna, P., Variability in precipitation, temperature and river runoff in Central Asia during the past 2000 yrs (2011) Global and Planetary Change, 76, pp. 95-104; Henkin, Z., Hadar, L., Noy, M.I., Human-scale structural heterogeneity induced by grazing in a Mediterranean woodland landscape (2007) Landscape Ecology, 22, pp. 577-587; Huang, R.H., Zhou, D.G., Chen, W., Recent progress in studies of air-land interaction over the ANWC and its impact on climate (2013) Chinese Journal of Atmospheric Sciences, 37 (2), pp. 189-210; IPCC, (2007) Summary for Policymakers of Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.

This study simulated the impact of climate change on the runoff generation and streamflow of Chu River Basin (CRB), a glacierized basin in Central Asia using the enhanced Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The model was calibrated and validated using the measured monthly streamflow data from three discharge gauge stations in CRB for the period 1961–1985 and was subsequently driven by downscaled future climate projections of five Global Circulation Models (GCMs) in Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under three radiative forcing scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). In this study, the period 1966–1995 was used as the baseline period, while 2016–2045 and 2066–2095 as the near-future and far-future period, respectively. As projected, the climate would become warmer and drier under all scenarios in the future, and the future climate would be characterized by larger seasonal and annual variations under higher RCP. A general decreasing trend was identified in the average annual runoff in glacier (−26.6% to −1.0%), snow (−21.4% to +1.1%) and streamflow (−27.7% to −6.6%) for most of the future scenario periods. The projected maximum streamflow in each of the two future scenarios occurred one month earlier than that in the baseline period because of the reduced streamflow in summer months. Results of this study are expected to arouse the serious concern about water resource availability in the headwater region of CRB under the continuously warming climate. Changes in simulated hydrologic outputs underscored the significance of lowering the uncertainties in temperature and precipitation projection. © 2015, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer - Verlag GmbH.","climate change; glacier; hydrologic modeling; meltwater runoff; snow","Aizen, V.B., Aizen, E.M., Melack, J.M., Climatic and hydrologic changes in the Tien Shan, Central Asia (1997) Journal of Climate, 10, pp. 1393-1404; Aizen, V.B., Kuzmichenok, V.A., Surazakov, A.B., Glacier changes in the Tien Shan as determined from topographic and remotely sensed data (2007) Global and Planetary Change, 56 (3-4), pp. 328-340; Anandhi, A., Frei, A., Pierson, D.C., Examination of change factor methodologies for climate change impact assessment (2011) Water Resources Research, 47 (3), p.

However, our understanding of vegetation seasonality is mostly limited to the mechanisms and attributes of phenological events, such as spring emergence and fall senescence. Here we have investigated the seasonal evolution of vegetation growth from winter dormancy to summer maturity of four forest types in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperate and boreal forests for 1982-2011. The present study assesses large-scale variations in the vegetation green-up rate (VG<inf>rate</inf>) and its connection to temperature variability using remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface air temperature. The average of the VG<inf>rate</inf> of the analysis period increases with latitude, which indicates that the canopy develops more rapidly from dormancy to maturity for vegetation in higher-latitude or colder climate zones. VG<inf>rate</inf> and precedent temperature also show a positive correlation (r) over temperate and boreal forests (67% of the forest area in the NH), indicating that increased temperatures lead to faster canopy development within the same climate zone or latitude band. Responsiveness of VG<inf>rate</inf> to temperature variability shows that despite the same magnitude of local temperature variability during extremely cold and warm years, the magnitude of VG<inf>rate</inf> acceleration in warm years (0.07 (15-day)-1) is larger than the VG<inf>rate</inf> deceleration in cold years (-0.03 (15-day)-1), suggesting that the response of VG<inf>rate</inf> to temperature variability is nonlinear. Among the four forest types examined in this study, the nonlinear responses are most clearly observed in deciduous broadleaf forests indicating that forest composition may regulate the large-scale response of canopy development to temperature variability. Overall, our results suggest that anomalous seasonal warming will significantly affect canopy developments over wide deciduous forest areas. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Climate variability; Global ecology;

In this paper, we present the framework of a dedicated software, the FRISBEE tool, for optimising quality of refrigerated food, energy use and the global warming impact of refrigeration technologies. The food quality models implemented in the FRISBEE tool are based on validated kinetic models, most of which are available as separate publications in this issue, while the models for calculating energy use and global warming impact have been validated using independent data. The software was developed within the framework of the European Union FP7 project, FRISBEE (Food Refrigeration Innovations for Safety, consumers' Benefit, Environmental impact and Energy optimisation along the cold chain in Europe). The consumers' version of the FRISBEE tool, with limited functionalities, will be made available as free downloadable software on the FRISBEE website, while the version with full functionalities will be used for consultancy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study models a CCHP system to investigate its annual total cost reduction, primary energy saving, and carbon dioxide emission reduction with respect to a reference system under five different operation strategies as follows: following the electric load (FEL), following the thermal load, following a hybrid electric-thermal load, following the seasonal operation strategy, and following the electric-thermal load of buildings (FLB). All the different operation strategies were optimized considering the part-load conditions for office and residential buildings in Dalian, China. The results indicate that the FLB and FEL yielded better performance than the other strategies. Furthermore, the redundant electricity and heat generated by CCHP systems were analyzed. The CCHP system operating under the strategies that produce less redundant electricity or heat may not yield better performance. However, the CCHP system operating under the strategies that produce huge redundant energy may achieve good integrated performance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The granular medium consisted of immersed stones giving a sediment bed thickness of 10. cm. High speed photographic and acoustic passive wireless techniques were employed to obtain the bubble size. The power spectra of the acoustic data for bubble production of 0.5 bubbles/s showed the existence of two principal peaks which are correlated with two discrete events. Firstly, a signal peak at 0.497. kHz, representing asymmetric bubble detachment, and secondly, a peak at 2.070. kHz, which corresponded to interactions of the granular media as inter-particle gaps advance, representing elastic resistance to orifice creation. Provided the signals were windowed to the bubble-detachment event only, the classical bubble-acoustical Minnaert relation for the bubble size agreed with optical data within about 10%. Since seepage generates discrete bubble pulses, appropriate acoustic analyses could both count and size the bubbles formed. The results of this study lead to the proposition that underwater acoustic sensors could warn of critical changes in bubble-seep behavior over time. This could lead to the possibility of remote early warnings, because shifts in production-rate regimes from seeps may herald alterations in the progression of global warming, or impending earthquakes and tsunamis. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Acoustic signals; Bubble detachment; Gas seeps; Hydrophone; Power spectra; Sediment bed","Al-Masry, W., Ali, E., Aqeel, Y., Determination of bubble characteristics in bubble columns using statistical analysis of acoustics sound measurements (2005) Chem.

However, in situ studies in agricultural soils on responses of soil respiration and CH<inf>4</inf> fluxes to climate warming are still sparse, especially from long-term studies with year-round heating. A warming experiment was conducted at Luancheng research station in the North China Plain from 2008 to 2013. Two levels of temperature (T: increase on average 1.5°C at 5cm soil depth by infrared heaters, C: ambient temperature) were combined with two levels of nitrogen (N) treatments (N1: with 315kgNha-1 y-1, N0: no nitrogen input) in the farmland.Soil was found to be a sink for CH<inf>4</inf> with no marked seasonal variations. In the wheat-growing season, warming and N input both decreased cumulative CH<inf>4</inf> uptake, probably because warming-induced soil drying in N1 treatment reduced (or limited) methanotroph activity by affecting soil NH<inf>4</inf> concentration. Across years, CH<inf>4</inf> emissions were negatively correlated with soil temperature in N1 treatment.Soil respiration showed clear seasonal fluctuations, with the largest emissions during summer and smallest in winter. Warming and nitrogen fertilization had no significant effects on total cumulative soil CO<inf>2</inf> fluxes. Soil respiration was positively correlated with microbial biomass C, and microbial biomass C was not affected significantly by warming or nitrogen addition. The lack of significant effects of warming on soil respiration may have resulted from: (1) warming-induced soil drying offsetting the effects of soil temperature; or (2) adaption of soil respiration to increased temperature. © 2015.","CH<inf>4</inf>; Nitrogen fertilization; Soil microbial biomass; Soil respiration; Soil warming; Wheat-soybean-fallow","Austin, A.T., Water pulses and biogeochemical cycles in arid and semiarid ecosystems (2004) Oecologia, 141 (2), pp. 221-235; Aronson, E.L., Helliker, B.R., Methane flux in non-wetland soils in response to nitrogen addition: a meta-analysis (2010) Ecology, 91 (11), pp. 3242-3251; Bao, S., (2000) Soil Agriculture Chemical Analysis.

Forest ecosystems in the State of California, USA, contain carbon that reaches the highest densities (mass per unit area) in the world, but it has been unresolved whether California ecosystems currently comprise a net sink or source of carbon. The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 established greenhouse gas reduction targets for fossil fuel-burning sectors and ecosystems, underscoring the importance of tracking ecosystem carbon. Here, we conduct statewide spatial inventories of the aboveground live carbon stocks of forests and other terrestrial ecosystems of California, excluding agricultural and urban areas. We analyzed biomass data from field measurements of the Forest Inventory and Analysis program, published biomass information and remote sensing data on non-forest vegetation, and spatial distributions of vegetation types, height, and fractional cover derived by the Landfire program from Landsat remote sensing at 30m spatial resolution. We conducted Monte Carlo analyses of the uncertainty of carbon stock change estimates from errors in tree biomass estimates, remote sensing, and estimates of the carbon fraction of biomass. The carbon stock in aboveground biomass was 850±230 Tg (mean±95% confidence interval) in 2010. We found a net aboveground live carbon stock change of -69±15 Tg from 2001 to 2010, a rate of change of -0.8±0.2%y-1. Due to slow decay of some dead wood, all of the live carbon stock change does not immediately generate emissions. Wildfires on 6% of the state analysis area produced two-thirds of the live carbon stock loss. This suggests that increased tree densities from a century of fire suppression have allowed the accumulation of fuel for carbon losses in recent wildfires. Remote sensing errors in vegetation classification accounted for most of the uncertainty in the carbon stock change estimates. Improvements are also needed to track spatial patterns of growth and dead wood. Our results establish the beginning of a time series for the state greenhouse gas inventory and provide information on the role of forest conservation and management in California in mitigating global climate change. © 2015 .","Carbon; Climate change; Protected areas; Uncertainty; Wildfire","Baccini, A., Goetz, S.J., Walker, W.S., Laporte, N.T., Sun, M., Sulla-Menashe, D., Hackler, J., Houghton, R.A., Estimated carbon dioxide emissions from tropical deforestation improved by carbon-density maps (2012) Nat.

Concerning forest operations, many studies have revealed remarkable differences in environmental impact mainly due to differences in location, forestry practice and technologies. As a consequence, reliable information on environmental performance for forestry operations and wood supply chain is considered to be crucial.This work aims to evaluate the environmental impacts of the firewood supply chain from high stand beech forest in North-Eastern Italy. Two scenarios have been considered: the first scenario investigates the firewood supply chain based on the wood harvested from the local forest, while the second one investigates the supply chain based on wood imported from the Balkans' area.The differences between the two scenarios are assessed through a ""gate to grave"" life cycle assessment for the impact categories: Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP); Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential (POCP) and Human Toxicity Potential (HTP). The functional unit is 1. MJ of energy produced by firewood.The study has shown that there are different critical values of transportation distance for impact categories.Although most of the chemicals emitted in the life cycle of firewood cannot be offset, a sustainable forest management can completely offset the fossil CO<inf>2</inf> emissions of the short and the long supply chain by saving less than 10% of the net increment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioenergy; Carbon offset; Firewood; Life cycle assessment; Supply chain","(2013) CO<inf>2</inf> emissions from fuel combustion, , http://www.iea.org/; (2009) Energy Information Administration, Office of Integrated Analysis and Forecasting, p. 284. , US Department of Energy, Washington, DC; Bentley, R.W., Mannan, S.A., Wheeler, S.J., Assessing the date of the global oil peak: the need to use 2P reserves (2007) Energy Policy, 35, pp. 6364-6382; Hanlon, P., McCartney, G., Peak oil: will it be public health's greatest challenge?

However, the effects of forest management on the carbon pools over the rotation period in Mediterranean areas are scarcely understood. The objective of this work is to assess the way in which two alternative management systems; one more intensive and the other more moderate (with less severe harvesting and more spread over time) affect the carbon stocks in the living tree biomass, coarse woody debris, forest floor and mineral soil in Mediterranean forests. For this purpose, two chronosequences were established covering the whole rotation period in two Pinus sylvestris L. forests. We conducted four forest inventories over a period of 15years, measuring the diameter and the height of all the trees higher than 1.3m in order to calculate the carbon stored in the living parts of the tree. Soil pits were excavated and we collected soil samples to estimate the soil organic carbon. We found that the temporal trends for living tree biomass were similar in both forests. However, the total living tree carbon stored at the end of the rotation period was greater in the forest with the longer rotation period and lighter thinning regime (345.5Mgha-1 of carbon) than in the intensively-managed forest (223.8Mgha-1 of carbon). On average, more carbon was found to be stored in the forest floor under the more intensive management system, whereas more carbon was present in the first 20cm of mineral soil under the moderate management system. Moreover, in each forest, the carbon stocks of the forest floor and in the uppermost cm of the soil remained constant over the rotation period. Therefore, management systems with longer rotation periods and moderate harvesting intensities are recommended to increase carbon fixation in Mediterranean forests. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive forest management; Carbon stocks; Climate change; Silviculture","Alvarez, S., Ortiz, C., Díaz-Pinés, E., Rubio, A., Influence of tree species composition, thinning intensity and climate change on carbon sequestration in Mediterranean mountain forests: a case study using the CO<inf>2</inf> Fix model (2014) Mitig.

The present study analyzes the spatial variability of climate change impacts on groundnut yields in the Anantapur district of India and examines the relative contribution of adaptation strategies. For this purpose, a web based decision support tool that integrates crop simulation model and Geographical Information System (GIS) was developed to assist agronomic decision making and this tool can be scalable to any location and crop. The climate change projections of five global climate models (GCMs) relative to the 1980-2010 baseline for Anantapur district indicates an increase in rainfall activity to the tune of 10.6 to 25% during Mid-century period (2040-69) with RCP 8.5. The GCMs also predict warming exceeding 1.4 to 2.4. °C by 2069 in the study region. The spatial crop responses to the projected climate indicate a decrease in groundnut yields with four GCMs (MPI-ESM-MR, MIROC5, CCSM4 and HadGEM2-ES) and a contrasting 6.3% increase with the GCM, GFDL-ESM2M. The simulation studies using CROPGRO-Peanut model reveals that groundnut yields can be increased on average by 1.0%, 5.0%, 14.4%, and 20.2%, by adopting adaptation options of heat tolerance, drought tolerant cultivars, supplemental irrigation and a combination of drought tolerance cultivar and supplemental irrigation respectively. The spatial patterns of relative benefits of adaptation options were geographically different and the greatest benefits can be achieved by adopting new cultivars having drought tolerance and with the application of one supplemental irrigation at 60. days after sowing. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change factors; Crop simulation; DSSAT; Virtual cultivars; Yield","Bapuji Rao, B., Ramana Rao, B.V., Subba Rao, A.V.M., Manikandan, N., Narasimha Rao, S.B.S., Rao, V.U.M., Venkateswarlu, B., Assessment of the impact of increasing temperature and rainfall variability on crop productivity in drylands - an illustrative approach (2011) Research Bulletin 1/2011, p. 32. , Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, Santoshnagar, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; Behera, S.K., Panda, R.K., Integrated management of irrigation water and fertilizers for wheat crop using field experiments and simulation modeling (2009) Agric.

To trace the response of mangrove vegetation to this early Paleogene warming, species diversity of Spinizonocolpites pollen (Nypa) was studied across Paleocene-Eocene transition. Two paleo-equatorial shallow marine stratigraphic sections Ranikor Barsora and Jathang from the east Khasi hills, South Shillong Plateau, Meghalaya were studied. Species diversity of Spinizonocolpites was inferred from pollen assemblages in aforementioned sections. Estimation of biodiversity through range-through method, Shannon-Wiener index, Simpson diversity index, rarefied richness curves and detrended correspondence analysis was done to assess the diversity pattern before, during, and after the warming event. Mean species diversity of paleo-mangroves inferred by counting the number of Spinizonocolpites species stratigraphically in the pollen assemblage, showed higher diversity during Paleocene/Eocene boundary in both the sections, followed by a significant decline during the Eocene. This pattern was consistent upon quantitative estimation for sample size, number of samples/time unit, lithofacies and depositional systems. Extreme warm and humid climate with high precipitation and good upstream runoff led to low saline conditions in coastal areas during Paleocene-Eocene boundary interval in paleo-equatorial region. This favored the diversification of Nypa, providing opportunities for new species in a wide range of low saline tidal zones to flourish. Post-warming during late Ypresian, decrease in precipitation, humidity and low upstream runoff, resulted in the restriction of low saline tidal zones in coastal areas, thus causing a decline in the diversity of Nypa mangrove. Hence, variations in species diversity and origination rates of the back mangrove palm genus Nypa described under Spinizonocolpites during the Paleocene-Eocene transition constitute an important step in understanding the effect of global warming on mangrove vegetation in paleo-equatorial region. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Global warming; Nypa; Paleocene Eocene thermal maximum; Species diversity; Spinizonocolpites","Akkìraz, M.S., Mine-Sezgül, K., Akgün, F., Palaeoecology of coal-bearing Eocene sediments in Central Anatolia (Turkey) based on quantitative palynological data (2008) Turk.

While drought is a natural temporal hazard, aridity is a constant climatic feature. This paper investigates the changes in drought characteristics across different aridity zones with and without consideration of potential evapotranspiration (PET), as a means to better assess drought in a warming climate. Two drought indexes are employed: (1) Standardized precipitation index (SPI), which is solely based on precipitation; and (2) Reconnaissance drought index (RDI), which, in addition to precipitation, takes PET into account. The two indexes are first employed to observed precipitation and PET data for the period 1960-2009 from the CRU (Climate Research Unit, University of East Anglia) TS 3.1 database. The results indicate that although all the aridity zones experience both downward and upward drought trends, no significant trend is found over large parts of the zones. However, the agreement between SPI and RDI reduces from the hyper-arid zone on one extreme toward the humid zone on the other. In the three more humid zones (i.e. semi-arid, sub-humid, and humid), the indexes exhibit different trends, with RDI showing more decreasing trends (i.e. becoming drier). While SPI generally shows more drought prone areas than RDI for the pre-1998 period, the opposite is observed for the post-1998 period. Given the known changes to PET in observed records, and also expected increases as global warming intensifies, these results suggest that RDI will be consistently different to the SPI as global warming intensifies. This hypothesis is further tested for historic and future climate projections from the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia) Mk3.6 global climate model (GCM), with use of the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and RCP8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathways). In this case, PET is calculated using FAO56-PM model for assessment of RDI. The results suggest that agreement between SPI and RDI is affected and decreases remarkably over time (between 1850 and 2100). All these lead to the conclusion that, in the face of climate change, PET, an important component in the hydrologic cycle, should not be ignored in drought modeling. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Aridity; Climate change; Drought; Reconnaissance drought index; Standardized precipitation index","Abramowitz, M., Stegun, A., (1965) Handbook of Mathematical Functions: with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables, , Dover Publications Inc., New York; Allen, R.G., Pereira, L.S., Raes, D., Smith, M., Crop evapotranspiration (1998) FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56, , Food and Agriculture Organization, Rome; Asadi Zarch, M.A., Sivakumar, B., Sharma, A., Assessment of global aridity change (2014), J.

In this context, this paper is aimed at the application of the Carbon Footprint (CF) to an agro-biogas supply chain (SC) in Southern Italy, according to ISO/TS 14067:2013, so as to calculate the related 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP<inf>100</inf>). The topic was addressed because agro-biogas SCs, though being acknowledged worldwide as sustainable ways to produce both electricity and heat, can be source of GHG emissions and therefore environmental assessments and improvements are needed. Additionally, the performed literature review highlighted deficiencies in PCF assessments, so this study could contribute to enriching the international knowledge on the environmental burdens associated with agro-biogas SCs. The analysis was conducted using a life-cycle approach, thus including in the assessment: functional unit choice, system border definition and inventory analysis development. The primary data needed was provided by a farm located in the province of Foggia (Apulia region in Southern Italy), already equipped with anaerobic digestion and cogeneration plant for biogas production and utilisation. Results from this study are in agreement with those found by some of the most relevant studies in the sector. Indeed, it was possible to observe that GWP<inf>100</inf> was almost entirely due to cropland farming and, in particular, to the production of ammonium nitrate in the amount required for fertilisation. Furthermore, environmental credits were observed thanks to: carbon sequestration enabled by no-tillage practice; and avoided production of chemical fertiliser thanks to 50% organic farming. Based upon the results obtained, a sensitivity analysis was carried out, thus highlighting reduced environmental impacts if ammonium nitrate was replaced with urea.Finally, thanks to this study, all the target stakeholders will learn more about the input/output flows involved in the system analysed, the related environmental impacts and the improvements needed to reduce them. In this way, it could be possible to compare the analysed agro-biogas SC with others of equal functionality, and so to enable considerations to be made on the resulting similarities and differences in terms of methodological approach, inventory flows and environmental impact. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Agro-biogas; Carbon footprint; Carbon sequestration; Environmental sustainability; Mineral fertilisation; No-tillage","Tricase, C., Lombardi, M., State of the art and prospects of Italian biogas production from animal sewage: technical-economic considerations (2009) Renewable Energy, 34, pp. 477-485; http://eur-lex.europa.eu, Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC.

This manuscript presents a case study on how the Q10 value for soil respiration changes with soil temperature and moisture in the rotation phases. In a three-year crop rotation system (wheat/wheat/millet/pea) in a semi-arid region of China, the soil respiration rate, temperature and moisture were measured under different crop phases from July 2010 to June 2013. The soil respiration rate was significantly lower in the winter wheat phase (1.63μmolm-2s-1) than the millet phase (2.40μmolm-2s-1) and pea phase (2.21μmolm-2s-1). However, the Q10 value was significantly higher in the wheat phase (2.76) than in the millet phase (1.85) and pea phase (1.47). The relationship between the Q10 values and soil temperature followed an exponential decay function in the rotation system, and the Q10 value was stable (1.8) with no obvious variation when the temperature exceeded 15°C. The Q10 value tended to increase with soil moisture until reaching a threshold of 14.7% soil moisture and then declined. Our results indicate that temperature-respiration empirical models should be parameterized according to crop type in the rotation phases, especially when estimating soil respiration in cold-resistant crops under global warming. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Millet; Pea; Soil moisture; Soil respiration; Soil temperature; Winter wheat","Andrews, J.A., Matamala, R., Westover, K.M., Schlesinger, W.H., Temperature effects on the diversity of soil heterotrophs and the delta C-13 of soil-respired CO2 (2000) Soil Biol.

The system comprises a plant cultivation unit, a feedstock transport unit, and a bioethanol conversion unit, with 1000. L of bioethanol as a functional unit. The net energy ratio is 3.84, and the net energy gain is 17.21. MJ/L. Agrochemical production consumes 76.58% of the life cycle fossil energy. The category with the most significant impact on the environment is eutrophication, followed by acidification, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, human toxicity, and global warming. Allocation method, waste recycling approach, and soil salinity significantly influence the results. Using vinasse to produce pellet fuel for steam generation significantly improves energy efficiency and decreases negative environmental impacts. Promoting reasonable management practices to alleviate saline stress and increasing agrochemical utilization efficiency can further improve environmental sustainability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioethanol; Environmental sustainability; Life cycle assessment; Saline-alkali land; Sweet sorghum stem","Amigun, B., Musango, J.K., Stafford, W., Biofuels and sustainability in Africa (2011) Renew.

However, its effect on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has not been well evaluated. To investigate the effect of PFM on GHG emissions and crop productivities, black PFM and no-mulching plots were installed as the main treatment, and three sub-treatments, chemical fertilizer (NPK) and two green manures, were arranged within each main treatment. Two cover crops (hairy vetch and barley) with different carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios were cultivated in the two green manure treatments during the fallow season. The aboveground biomasses of vetch (23-25Mg fresh weight ha-1) and barley (10-11Mgha-1) were incorporated before maize seedling transplanting. Maize was cultivated without chemical fertilization in the two green manure treatments, whereas the recommended chemical fertilizers were applied in the NPK treatment. During two annual cropping seasons, the emission rates of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases were simultaneously monitored once a week using the closed-chamber method. Total global warming potential (GWP) was calculated as CO2 equivalents by multiplying the seasonal CH4 and N2O fluxes by 25 and 298, respectively. Irrespective of soil amendments, PFM significantly increased soil temperature and moisture content by a mean of 2°C and 0.04m3m-3 over no-mulching, respectively. Plastic film mulching increased grain productivity by 8-33% over no-mulching. However, PFM significantly decreased soil organic matter content and largely increased the two major GHG emissions. As a result, PFM increased the total GWP by 12-82% over no-mulching, irrespective of the soil amendments. In conclusion, more sustainable mulching systems should be developed that can sustain soil quality and minimize environmental impacts, including GHG emissions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cover crop; Global warming potential; Methane; Nitrous oxide","Conrad, R., Rothfuss, F., Methane oxidation in the soil surface layer of a flooded ricefield and the effect of ammonium (1991) Biol.

Management practices are prevalent in forestry, particularly in dryland ecosystems, known to be water and nitrogen (N) limited. Irrigation and fertilisation are thus routinely applied to increase the yield of forest products. However, the contribution of forest management practices to current GHG budgets and consequently to soil net global warming potential (GWP) is still largely unaccounted for, particularly in dryland ecosystems. We quantified the long-term effect (six years) of irrigation and fertilisation and the impact of land-use change, from grassland to a Eucalyptus plantation on N<inf>2</inf>O, CH<inf>4</inf> and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and soil net GWP, within a dryland ecosystem. To identify biotic and abiotic drivers of GHG emissions, we explored the relationship of N<inf>2</inf>O, CH<inf>4</inf> and CO<inf>2</inf> fluxes with soil abiotic characteristics and abundance of ammonia-oxidizers, N<inf>2</inf>O-reducing bacteria, methanotrophs and total soil bacteria. Our results show that GHG emissions, particularly N<inf>2</inf>O and CO<inf>2</inf> are constrained by water availability and both N<inf>2</inf>O and CH<inf>4</inf> are constrained by N availability in the soil. We also provide evidence of functional microbial groups being key players in driving GHG emissions. Our findings illustrate that GHG emission budgets can be affected by forest management practices and provide a better mechanistic understanding for future mitigation options. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Ammonia oxidizers; Bacteria; GHG emissions; Management practices; Methanotrophs; N<inf>2</inf>O-reducing bacteria","Allen, D.E., Mendham, D.S., Singh, B., Cowie, A., Wang, W., Dalal, R.C., Raison, R.J., Nitrous oxide and methane emissions from soil are reduced following afforestation of pasture lands in three contrasting climatic zones (2009) Soil Research, 47, pp. 443-458; Aronson, E., Allison, S.D., Meta-analysis of environmental impacts on nitrous oxide release in response to N amendment (2012) Frontiers in Microbiology, 3, p. 212; Austin, A., Yahdjian, L., Stark, J., Belnap, J., Porporato, A., Norton, U., Ravetta, D., Schaeffer, S., Water pulses and biogeochemical cycles in arid and semiarid ecosystems (2004) Oecologia, 141, pp. 221-235; Baggs, E.M., Soil microbial sources of nitrous oxide: recent advances in knowledge, emerging challenges and future direction (2011) Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 3, pp. 321-327; Barton, C.V.M., Ellsworth, D.S., Medlyn, B.E., Duursma, R.A., Tissue, D.T., Adams, M.A., Eamus, D., Linder, S., Whole-tree chambers for elevated atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> experimentation and tree scale flux measurements in south-eastern Australia: the Hawkesbury Forest Experiment (2010) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 150, pp. 941-951; Barton, L., Gleeson, D.B., Maccarone, L.D., Zúñiga, L.P., Murphy, D.V., Is liming soil a strategy for mitigating nitrous oxide emissions from semi-arid soils?

The four drought indices are the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), the Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI), the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Standardized Palmer Drought Index (SPDI). The analysis uses long-term simulated series with varying averages and variances, as well as global observational data to assess the sensitivity to real climatic conditions in different regions of the World. The results show differences in the sensitivity to ETo and P among the four drought indices. The PDSI shows the lowest sensitivity to variation in their climate inputs, probably as a consequence of the standardization procedure of soil water budget anomalies. The RDI is only sensitive to the variance but not to the average of P and ETo. The SPEI shows the largest sensitivity to ETo variation, with clear geographic patterns mainly controlled by aridity. The low sensitivity of the PDSI to ETo makes the PDSI perhaps less apt as the suitable drought index in applications in which the changes in ETo are most relevant. On the contrary, the SPEI shows equal sensitivity to P and ETo. It works as a perfect supply and demand system modulated by the average and standard deviation of each series and combines the sensitivity of the series to changes in magnitude and variance. Our results are a robust assessment of the sensitivity of drought indices to P and ETo variation, and provide advice on the use of drought indices to detect climate change impacts on drought severity under a wide variety of climatic conditions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Evaporation; Global warming; Palmer Drought Severity Index; Reconnaissance Drought Index; Standardized Palmer Drought Index; Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index","Akinremi, O.O., McGinn, S.M., Barr, A.G., Evaluation of the Palmer Drought Index on the canadian praires (1996) J.

Warmer temperatures could potentially result in increased oxidative stress, and it is not known whether stenothermal fish can cope with this on a cellular and physiological level. In order to address this, we exposed bald notothen (. Pagothenia borchgrevinki), a fish species endemic to Antarctica, to an increase in temperature from -. 1.6. °C to 4. °C and measured the effects on oxidative stress including antioxidant defenses, oxidative damage in proteins and lipids, and transcriptional regulation of involved genes. We show that the fish responds to an acute (12. h) temperature increase with increased antioxidant defenses. However, these antioxidant defenses were similar to basal levels following long-term (3. weeks) exposure to the higher temperature and moreover, these individuals also had higher levels of oxidative damage. These results indicate that this species has the ability to alter levels of endogenous antioxidants, but that this response is transient and insufficient to protect against oxidative damage. These effects may have serious consequences for these fish in a warmer future since long-term consequences of this accumulation of damaged lipids and proteins are associated with aging and known to include decreased cellular function, disease and eventually cell death. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Fish; Global warming; Oxidative damage; Oxidative stress; Polar","Abele, D., Puntarulo, S., Formation of reactive species and induction of antioxidant defence systems in polar and temperate marine invertebrates and fish (2004) Comp.

Estimates of this absorption vary greatly, in large part due to the effect of different land-use histories on the estimates available in the literature. We relate land-use history to aboveground biomass accumulation of secondary vegetation in plots on land that had been used for agriculture (unmechanized manioc and maize) and for pasture in small rural properties in the Tarumã-Mirim settlement near Manaus in central Amazonia, Brazil. We evaluated influence of (a) age of the second growth vegetation, (b) time of use as agriculture or pasture and (c) number of times the area was burned. Biomass data were obtained by destructive sampling of all plants with diameter at breast height >1. cm in 24 parcels of secondary vegetation ranging from 1 to 15. years of age in abandoned pasture (n= 9) and agriculture (n= 15). As compared to secondary vegetation in abandoned agricultural fields, vegetation in abandoned cattle pasture (the predominant use history for Amazonian secondary vegetation) grows 38% more slowly to age 6. years. Number of burns also negatively affects biomass recovery. Applying the growth rates we measured to the secondary forests reported in Brazil's Second National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change suggests that carbon uptake by this vegetation is overestimated by a factor of four in the report. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Amazon; Biomass; Brazil; Global warming; Land use; Secondary vegetation","Braga, P.I.S., Subdivisão fitogeográfica, tipos de vegetação, conservação e inventário florístico da floresta amazÔnica (1979) Acta Amazonica, 9, pp. 53-80; Solos do Distrito Agropecuário da SUFRAMA (1971), p. 99. , Convênio para levantamento da área do Distrito Agropecuário da SUFRAMA, Instituto de Pesquisa e Experimentação Agropecuária do Norte (IPEAN) and IPEAAOc, Manaus, Amazonas, BrazilBrazil's Initial National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (2004), p. 271. , http://www.mct.gov.br, MCT, Brasília, DF, BrazilSecond National Communication of Brazil to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (2010), 2, p. 493. , http://www.mct.gov.br, MCT, Brasília, DF, BrazilBuschbacher, R., Uhl, C., Serrão, E.A.S., Abandoned pastures in eastern Amazonia.

Using this data for 678 grid points (12.5. km interval) groups of cluster regions with similar climates, the G1 (Northwest), G2 (Middle), G3 (Northeast) and G4 (Southern) regions, are constructed. Drought forecasting period is categorised into the early phase (EP, 2014-2040), middle phase (MP, 2041-2070) and latter phase (LP, 2071-2100). Future drought events are quantified and ranked according to the duration and intensity. Moreover, the occurrences of drought (when, where, how severe) within the clustered regions are represented as a spatial map over Korea. Based on the grid-point averages, the most severe future drought throughout the 87-year period are expected to occur in Namwon around 2039-2041 with peak intensity (minimum EDI) -3.54 and projected duration of 580. days. The most severe drought by cluster analysis is expected to occur in the G3 region with a mean intensity of -2.85 in 2027. Within the spatial area of investigation, 6.6. years of drought periodicity and a slight decrease in the peak intensity is noted. Finally a spatial-temporal drought map is constructed for all clusters and time-periods under consideration. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Drought periodicity; Drought trend; EDI; Future drought; Global warming; RCP 8.5","Boo, K.O., Kwon, W.T., Oh, J.H., Baek, H.J., Response of global warming on regional climate change over Korea: an experiment with the MM5 model (2004) Geophys.

To evaluate the spatial variation of CH<inf>4</inf> emission and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage along the invasion chronosequence, we selected four sites including bare mudflat (Control, as first year invasion), and marshes invaded by S.alterniflora in 2002 (SA-1), 1999 (SA-2) and 1995 (SA-3), respectively, in Sheyang county, Jiangsu, China and set up the marsh mesocosm system for flux measurement. The mean accumulation rate of SOC in the 0-30cm layer exponentially increased with the invasion time, ranging from 1.08 (over the first 9 years) to 2.35MgCha-1yr-1 (over the period of 12-16 years). The cumulative CH<inf>4</inf> emission during the growth season was 20.5, 75.4, 81.0 and 92.2kg CH<inf>4</inf>ha-1 in Control, SA-1, SA-2 and SA-3, respectively, and there was a binomial relationship between CH<inf>4</inf> emission and invasion time. Cumulative CH<inf>4</inf> emission was logarithmically increased with SOC concentration; however the ratio of CH<inf>4</inf> emission to SOC concentration was inversely correlated with the invasion time in the S.alterniflora marsh, suggesting that the less increased SOC in the S.alterniflora marsh was converted into CH<inf>4</inf>. The net global warming potential (GWP) was estimated at 733kg CO<inf>2</inf>-eq ha-1yr-1 in the tidal mudflat and reduced to-1273 (SA-1) to-2233kg CO<inf>2</inf>-eq ha-1yr-1 (SA-3) in the S.alterniflora marsh. Our results indicated that S.alterniflora invasion effectively sequestrated atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> and mitigated GWP in the coastal marsh of China. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon sequestration; CH<inf>4</inf> emission; Coastal salt marsh; SOC; Spartina alterniflora invasion","Allen, D.E., Dalal, R.C., Rennenberg, H., Meyer, R.L., Reeves, S., Schmidt, S., Spatial and temporal variation of nitrous oxide and methane flux between subtropical mangrove sediments and the atmosphere (2007) Soil Biol.

Here we examine the effect of such contrarian talking points on the scientific community itself. We show that although scientists are trained in dealing with uncertainty, there are several psychological reasons why scientists may nevertheless be susceptible to uncertainty-based argumentation, even when scientists recognize those arguments as false and are actively rebutting them. Specifically, we show that prolonged stereotype threat, pluralistic ignorance, and a form of projection (the third-person effect) may cause scientists to take positions that they would be less likely to take in the absence of outspoken public opposition. We illustrate the consequences of seepage from public debate into the scientific process with a case study involving the interpretation of temperature trends from the last 15 years. We offer ways in which the scientific community can detect and avoid such inadvertent seepage. © 2015 The Authors.","Climate change; Climate change denial; Global warming ""hiatus""; Scientific assessment; Scientific norms","Allan, R.P., Liu, C., Loeb, N.G., Palmer, M.D., Roberts, M., Smith, D., Vidale, P.-L., Changes in global net radiative imbalance 1985-2012 (2014) Geophys.

Previous work has focused on the assumption that a task can be assigned to any processor. In contrast, we initially study the problem of task scheduling on restricted parallel processors. The restriction takes account of affinities between tasks and processors; that is, a task has its own eligible set of processors. We adopt the Speed Scaling (SS) method to save energy under an execution time constraint (on the makespan Cmax), and the processors can run at arbitrary speeds in [smin,smax]. Our objective is to minimize the overall energy consumption. The energy-efficient scheduling problem, involving task assignment and speed scaling, is inherently complex as it is proved to be NP-complete for general tasks. We formulate the problem as an Integer Programming (IP) problem. Specifically, we devise a polynomial-time optimal scheduling algorithm for the case in which tasks have a uniform size. Our algorithm runs in O(mn3logn) time, where m is the number of processors and n is the number of tasks. We then present a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a bounded approximation factor when the tasks have arbitrary-size work. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithm could provide an energy-efficient solution to the problem of task scheduling on restricted parallel processors. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Through a randomized field-based experiment, this study examines the effects of communicating about risks to marine organisms and public health on people's support for policies aimed at mitigating those risks as a function of different message frames. To maximize the salience of these issues, participants were recruited from ferry passengers (. N=543) in the San Juan Islands of Washington State in the summer of 2013 and randomized to read one of four fictitious news articles detailing the increased incidence of deadly bacteria (. Vibrio) in oysters in the Pacific Northwest. Depending on condition, the article attributed the causes to global warming or climate change and the consequences primarily to oyster health or public health-frames that recent research suggests can influence how the public responds to environmental messages. Results showed high levels of support for marine policy and high concern about the prevalence of marine disease risks across the sample (i.e., irrespective of framing condition). Analysis of individual differences suggested that participants with lower biocentric (i.e., environmental) values were more supportive of marine policy when exposed to the article highlighting consequences to oyster health from global warming, an effect that was fully mediated (or explained) by level of self-reported concern. The results demonstrate the importance of communication about marine disease in showing how subtle changes in message frames can elicit differential support for marine policy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change communication; Message framing; Oysters; Risk communication; Risk perception","Akerlof, K., DeBono, R., Berry, P., Leiserowitz, A., Roser-Renouf, C., Clarke, K.L., Public perceptions of climate change as a human health risk: surveys of the United States, Canada and Malta (2010) Int J Environ Res Public Health, 7, pp. 2559-2606; Akerlof, K., Maibach, E.W., A rose by any other name. . .?: What members of the general public prefer to call ``climate change (2011) Clim Change, 106, pp. 699-710; Barton, A., Hales, B., Waldbusser, G.G., Langdon, C., Feely, R.A., The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, shows negative correlation to naturally elevated carbon dioxide levels: Implications for near-term ocean acidification effects (2012) Limnology and Oceanography, 57 (3), pp. 698-710; Brackney, M., McAndrew, F.T., Ecological worldviews and receptivity to different types of arguments for preserving endangered species (2001) J Environ Edu, 33, pp. 17-20; Burge, C.A., Mark Eakin, C., Friedman, C.S., Froelich, B., Hershberger, P.K., Hofmann, E.E., Climate change influences on marine infectious diseases: implications for management and society (2014) Ann Rev Mar Sci, 6, pp. 249-277; Chong, D., Druckman, J.N., Framing public opinion in competitive democracies.

The results show that the greatest exergy destruction (181 MW) occurs in the combustion chamber. It is because of irreversibility of the chemical reactions in the combustion process. Also the lowest exergy efficiency is related to the fuel cell. Advanced exergy analysis shows that the most portion of the exergy destruction is avoidable (more than 65%).

In the former, strategies to reach higher recycling levels are affecting existing waste-to-energy (WtE) treatment infrastructure, by inducing additional overcapacity and this in turn rebounds as pressure on the waste and recyclable materials markets. This study addresses such situations by documenting the effects, in terms of resource recovery, global warming potential (GWP) and cumulative energy demand (CED), of a transition from a self-sufficient waste management system based on minimal separate collection and efficient WtE, towards a system with extended separate collection of recyclable materials and biowaste. In doing so, it tackles key questions: (1) whether recycling and biological treatment are environmentally better compared to highly efficient WtE, and (2) what are the implications of overcapacity-related cascading effects, namely waste import, when included in the comparison of alternative waste management systems. System changes, such as the implementation of kerbside separate collection of recyclable materials were found to significantly increase material recovery, besides leading to substantial GWP and CED savings in comparison to the WtE-based system. Bio-waste separate collection contributed with additional savings when co-digested with manure, and even more significantly when considering future renewable energy background systems reflecting the benefits induced by the flexible use of biogas. Given the current liberalization of trade in combustible waste in Europe, waste landfilling was identified as a short-to-medium-term European-wide waste management marginal reacting to overcapacity effects induced by the implementation of increased recycling strategies. When waste import and, consequently, avoided landfilling were included in the system boundary, additional savings of up to 700kg CO<inf>2</inf> eq. and 16GJ eq. of primary energy per tonne of imported waste were established. Conditions, such as energy recovery efficiency, and thresholds beyond which import-related savings potentially turn into GWP burdens were also determined. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Combustible waste shipments; Commingled recyclables; Consequential LCA; Material efficiency; Waste management systems","Allegrini, E., Maresca, A., Olsson, M.E., Holtze, M.S., Boldrin, A., Astrup, T.F., Quantification of the resource recovery potential of municipal solid waste incineration bottom ashes (2014) Waste Manag., 34, pp. 1627-1636; Bergsma, G., Bijleveld, M., Otten, M., Krutwagen, B., LCA: Recycling of Plastic Packaging Waste from Households (2011) LCA: recycling van kunststof verpakkingsafval uit huishoudens, , CE Delft, Delft; Bernstad, A., Jansen, J.L., Alife cycle approach to the management of household food waste - a Swedish full-scale case study (2011) Waste Manag., 31, pp. 1879-1896; Bernstad, A., Jansen, J.L., Aspegren, H., Life cycle assessment of a household solid waste source separation programme: a Swedish case study (2011) Waste Manag.

Based on historical data, diurnal temperature change exhibited a distinct negative relationship with maize yield, whereas minimum temperature correlated positively to rice yield. Corresponding to the evaluated climate change derived from coupled climate models included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 scenario (RCP4.5), the projected maize yield changes for three future periods [2010–39 (period 1), 2040–69 (period 2), and 2070–99 (period 3)] relative to the mean yield in the baseline period (1976–2005) were 2.92%, 3.11% and 2.63%, respectively. By contrast, the evaluated rice yields showed slightly larger increases of 7.19%, 12.39%, and 14.83%, respectively. The uncertainties in the crop response are discussed by considering the uncertainties obtained from both the climate and the crop models. The range of impact of the uncertainty became markedly wider when integrating these two sources of uncertainty. The probabilistic assessments of the evaluated change showed maize yield to be relatively stable from period 1 to period 3, while the rice yield showed an increasing trend over time. The results presented in this paper suggest a tendency of the yields of maize and rice in NEC to increase (but with great uncertainty) against the background of global warming, which may offer some valuable guidance to government policymakers. © 2015, Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","climate models; northeastern China; projection; statistical crop models; uncertainty","Andrieu, C., De Freitas, N., Doucet, A., Jordan, M.I., An introduction to MCMC for machine learning (2003) Machine Learnin, 50, pp. 5-43; Browne, W.J., Rasbash, J., (2009) MCMC Estimation in ML-w-iN v2.1.

They have been extensively studied in many of these regions, but there are few studies on fans in periglacial, Arctic and Antarctic regions. Fans in such regions are exposed to many site-specific environmental conditions in addition to their geological and topographic setting: there can be continuous to discontinuous permafrost and snow avalanches and freeze-thaw cycles can be frequent. We study fans in the high-Arctic environment of Svalbard to (1) increase our fundamental knowledge on the morphology and morphometry of fans in periglacial environments, and (2) to identify the specific influence of periglacial conditions on fans in these environments. Snow avalanches have a large geomorphic effect on fans on Svalbard: the morphology of colluvial fans is mainly determined by frequent snow avalanches (e.g., flattened cross-profiles, exposed fine-grained talus on the proximal fan domain, debris horns and tails). As a result, there are only few fans with a rockfall-dominated morphology, in contrast to most other regions on Earth. Slush avalanches contribute significant amounts of sediment to the studied alluvial fans. The inactive surfaces of many alluvial fans are rapidly beveled and leveled by snow avalanches, solifluction and frost weathering. Additionally, periglacial reworking of the fan surface often modifies the original morphology of inactive fan surfaces, for example by the formation of ice-wedge polygons and hummocks. Permafrost lowers the precipitation threshold for debris-flow initiation, but limits debris-flow volumes. Global warming-induced permafrost degradation will likely increase debris-flow activity and -magnitude on fans in periglacial environments. Geomorphic activity on snow avalanche-dominated colluvial fans will probably increase due to future increases in precipitation, but depends locally on climate-induced changes in dominant wind direction. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Alluvial fan; Colluvial fan; Debris flow; Periglacial; Snow avalanche; Svalbard","Aagaard, K., Carmack, E., The role of sea ice and other fresh water in the Arctic circulation (1989) J.

The volcanic signals are identified in the residual temperature time series after removal of the linear trend, the quasi-biennial oscillation and El Nino Southern Oscillation components. Eight minor volcanic eruptions (six from the tropics and two from midlatitude) over the last decade (2001-2010) are analyzed in this study. We found significant volcanic signals in the UTLS temperature only in association with the tropical Soufrière Hills and Tavurvur eruptions (in May 2006 and in October 2006, respectively). Other four tropical eruptions had very small aerosol perturbations and did not show any significant UTLS temperature change. Out of the two midlatitude eruptions, Sarychev peak had similar stratospheric aerosol perturbations as Soufrière Hills and Tavurvur eruptions, but did not show any significant UTLS temperature change. The volcanic signals in the UTLS temperature from the tropical Soufrière Hills and Tavurvur eruptions were observed for the period of 7 months after August 2006. A warming of 0.5-0.8. K in the tropical 16-18.5. km (100-70. hPa) layer was observed in association with these two tropical eruptions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Angell, J.K., Tropospheric temperature variations adjusted for El Niño, 1958-1998 (2000) J.

Protea species are assumed to be well adapted to warm summers characteristic of their natural Mediterranean-type habitat, but their plasticity in responding to higher growth temperatures is not known. Using infrared lamps, a greenhouse-based temperature gradient was constructed, with temperatures ranging from ambient to ambient+3.1°C. Potted plants of Protea 'Pink Ice' (P. compacta R. Br×P. susannae Phill.) were grown at five positions along this gradient for 12 months under irrigation. Simultaneously, a field verification experiment in a nearby commercial 'Pink Ice' orchard was conducted under ambient temperature and ambient+2.9°C. Increased sclerophylly (leaf dry weight per unit area) with increasing temperature indicated leaf structural changes. While leaf area based gas exchange (net CO<inf>2</inf> assimilation rate, stomatal conductance and dark respiration rate) did not differ across the temperature gradient, leaf weight based CO<inf>2</inf> assimilation rate and dark respiration rate decreased significantly towards the upper end of the temperature range. The optimum temperature for net CO<inf>2</inf> assimilation rate (T<inf>opt</inf>) showed seasonal adjustments, but increased in response to experimental warming only in the field experiment. Significant temperature elevation resulted in an earlier onset of spring bud break, but warming extended inflorescence initiation from the spring flush to the summer flush, leading to delayed flowering. Aboveground biomass allocation shifted from inflorescences to leaves and to a lesser degree to stems, with elevated temperatures, whereas root growth was stimulated in the middle of the warming range. The results of this study suggest that elevated temperature may prolong the vegetative growth period in some Protea cultivars where water is not limiting, at the expense of flower production. This could have significant economic and marketing consequences for commercial cut flower production systems. The findings are also of significance to ecologists studying the responses of Proteaceae to climate change. © 2015 South African Association of Botanists.","Biomass allocation; Climate change; Fynbos cut flower production; Gas exchange; Phenology; Temperature acclimation","Agenbag, L., Esler, K., Midgley, G., Boucher, C., Diversity and species turnover on an altitudinal gradient in Western Cape, South Africa: baseline data for monitoring range shifts in response to climate change (2008) Bothalia, 38, pp. 161-191; Allen, L.H., Vu, J.C.V., Carbon dioxide and high temperature effects on growth of young orange trees in a humid, subtropical environment (2009) Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 149, pp. 820-830; Atkin, O.K., Holly, C., Ball, M.C., Acclimation of snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora) leaf respiration to seasonal and diurnal variations in temperature: the importance of changes in the capacity and temperature sensitivity of respiration (2000) Plant, Cell and Environment, 23, pp. 15-26; Badeck, F.-W., Bondeau, A., Böttcher, K., Doktor, D., Lucht, W., Schaber, J., Sitch, S., Responses of spring phenology to climate change (2004) New Phytologist, 162, pp. 295-309; Battaglia, M., Beadle, C., Loughhead, S., Photosynthetic temperature response of Eucalyptus globulus and Eucalyptus nitens (1996) Tree Physiology, 16, pp. 81-89; Bennie, A.T.P., Taylor, H.M., Georgen, P.G., An assessment of the core-break method for estimating rooting density of different crops in the field (1987) Soil and Tillage Research, 9, pp. 347-353; Berry, J., Björkman, O., Photosynthetic response and adaptation to temperature in higher plants (1980) Annual Review of Plant Physiology, 31, pp. 491-543; Bomhard, B., Richardson, D.M., Donaldson, J.S., Hughes, G.O., Midgley, G.F., Raimondo, D.C., Rebelo, A.G., Thuiller, W., Potential impacts of future land use and climate change on the red list status of the Proteaceae in the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa (2005) Global Change Biology, 11, pp. 1452-1468; Carlson, J.E., Holsinger, K.E., Prunier, R., Plant responses to climate in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa: evidence for adaptive differentiation in the Proteaceae (2011) Evolution, 65, pp. 108-124; Long-Term Adaptation Scenarios Flagship Research Programme (LTAS) for South Africa (2013) Climate Trends and Scenarios, , (Pretoria, South Africa); Long-Term Adaptation Scenarios Flagship Research Programme (LTAS) for South Africa (2013) Biodiversity, , (Pretoria, South Africa); Dent, D., (2000) Insect Pest Management, , CABI Publishing, Oxon, UK; Dunne, J.A., Saleska, S.R., Fischer, M.L., Harte, J., Integrating experimental and gradient methods in ecological climate change research (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 904-916; Dupee, S.A., Goodwin, P.B., Flower initiation in Protea and Telopea (1990) Acta Horticulturae, 264, pp. 71-77; Ericsson, T., Rytter, L., Vapaavuori, E., Physiology of carbon allocation in trees (1996) Biomass and Bioenergy, 11, pp. 115-127; Fuss, A.M., Sedgley, M., Variability in cut flower production of Banksia coccinea R.

Koninckinid fauna recorded in the late Pliensbachian-early Toarcian from the easternmost Subbetic basin is analyzed and identified as a precursor signal for one of the most conspicuous mass extinction events of the Phylum Brachiopoda, a multi-phased interval with episodes of changing environmental conditions, whose onset can be detected from the Elisa-Mirabile subzones up to the early Toarcian extinction boundary in the lowermost Serpentinum Zone (T-OAE). The koninckinid fauna had a previously well-established migration pattern from the intra-Tethyan to the NW-European basins but a first phase with a progressive warming episode in the Pliensbachian-Toarcian transition triggered a koninckinid fauna exodus from the eastern/central Tethys toward the westernmost Mediterranean margins. A second stage shows an adaptive response to more adverse conditions in the westernmost Tethyan margins and finally, an escape and extinction phase is detected in the Atlantic areas from the mid-Polymorphum Zone onwards up to their global extinction in the lowermost Serpentinum Zone. This migration pattern is independent of the paleogeographic bioprovinciality and is unrelated to a facies-controlled pattern. The anoxic/suboxic environmental conditions should only be considered as a minor factor of partial control since well-oxygenated habitats are noted in the intra-Tethyan basins and this factor is noticeable only in the second westward migratory stage (with dwarf taxa and oligotypical assemblages). The analysis of cold-seep proxies in the Subbetic deposits suggests a radiation that is independent of methane releases in the Subbetic basin. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Early Jurassic; Koninckinids; Mass extinction; Western Tethys","Aberhan, M., Fürsich, F.T., Diversity analysis of Lower Jurassic bivalves of the Andean Basin and the Pliensbachian-Toarcian mass extinction (1997) Lethaia, 29, pp. 181-195; Ager, D.V., British Liassic Terebratulida (Brachiopoda) part I (1990) Monogr.

Here we analyse five projections from different coupled ocean–atmosphere models with an additional 0.1 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3/s) of freshwater released around Greenland between 2050 and 2089. We find on average a further weakening of the AMOC at 26°N of 1.1 ± 0.6 Sv representing a 27 ± 14 % supplementary weakening in 2080–2089, as compared to the weakening relative to 2006–2015 due to the effect of the external forcing only. This weakening is lower than what has been found with the same ensemble of models in an identical experimental set-up but under recent historical climate conditions. This lower sensitivity in a warmer world is explained by two main factors. First, a tendency of decoupling is detected between the surface and the deep ocean caused by an increased thermal stratification in the North Atlantic under the effect of global warming. This induces a shoaling of ocean deep ventilation through convection hence ventilating only intermediate levels. The second important effect concerns the so-called Canary Current freshwater leakage; a process by which additionally released freshwater in the North Atlantic leaks along the Canary Current and escapes the convection zones towards the subtropical area. This leakage is increasing in a warming climate, which is a consequence of decreasing gyres asymmetry due to changes in Ekman pumping. We suggest that these modifications are related with the northward shift of the jet stream in a warmer world. For these two reasons the AMOC is less susceptible to freshwater perturbations (near the deep water formation sides) in the North Atlantic as compared to the recent historical climate conditions. Finally, we propose a bilinear model that accounts for the two former processes to give a conceptual explanation about the decreasing AMOC sensitivity due to freshwater input. Within the limit of this bilinear model, we find that 62 ± 8 % of the reduction in sensitivity is related with the changes in gyre asymmetry and freshwater leakage and 38 ± 8 % is due to the reduction in deep ocean ventilation associated with the increased stratification in the North Atlantic. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","AMOC; Greenland ice sheet melting; North Atlantic; Oceanic dynamics; Oceanic gyre; Ocean–atmosphere interactions; Sea-level rise; Thermohaline circulation","Bamber, J., van den Broeke, M., Ettema, J., Lenaerts, J., Rignot, E., Recent large increases in freshwater fluxes from Greenland into the North Atlantic (2012) Geophys Res Lett, 39, p. 19501; Belkin, I.M., Levitus, S., Antonov, J., Malmberg, S.-A., Great Salinity Anomalies (1998) in the North Atlantic.

Some of these reports highlight the need to analyse the materials and techniques used today in order to make the building sector more sustainable. This paper presents the results of embodied energy and global warming potential, using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, for load-bearing walls, being these one of the most common types of structures for buildings. This study analyses through an eco-design tool new options for materials used in the construction of structural load-bearing walls. The research aims to examine the environmental performance of each material alternative assessed: fired clay brick masonry (FC), concrete block masonry (CB), reinforced concrete-based wall (RC), and stabilized soil block masonry (SS); stabilized with natural fibers and alginates. These conventional and new materials - especially those with a low level of embodied energy, such as earth blocks - are evaluated from the point of view of their environmental consequences. ©2015 Elsevier B.V.

Though current emphasis has been on identifying and characterizing the potential geological sequestration reservoirs, there is also an urgent need to ensure that the sequestered CO2 will remain in place under reasonable perturbations, e.g., under seismic activity. One of the potential geological reservoirs identified is unmineable coal seams due to the advantage of recovering fuel gas like CH4 while sequestering CO2. Therefore, a closed experimental setup was constructed where Illinois bituminous coal cores could be subjected to compressive shockwaves while simultaneously monitoring the emission of gases from CO2 pressurized coal cores. The results from the pressurized coal cores were compared with the behavior manifested by un-pressurized coal cores as well as porous pumice stone cores, which were also subjected to shockwaves. As expected, the un-pressurized cores showed no significant emission of CO2 when subjected to shock; however, this was not the case for the cores which were pressurized with CO2. The results indicate that massive amounts of CO2 would be emitted if the cores were exposed to atmospheric pressure simulating a situation where caprock has been compromised during primary seismic activity. Irrespective of the belief that coal interacts strongly with CO2, both chemically and physically, compressive (0.374 MPa) shockwaves forced almost all the CO2 to be ejected from the coal cores. Surprisingly, most, if not all, the sequestered CO2 would be emitted in less than 1 h if the cores were subjected to reasonably moderate shocks. In actual seismic activity conditions, one expects conditions to be even more severe than in the experimental setup used in this study because of the presence of compressive and transverse stresses and shears. If such is the case, CO2 may be emitted even faster. It is reasonable to argue that Illinois bituminous coals may not be suitable hosts for sequestering CO2 because the region is prone to seismic activity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this contribution, an experimental study was carried out to examine the release rates of major elements (Ca, K, Mg and Al) from the surface sediments in the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Estuary under the pH values of 4.0, 6.0 and 7.0. The two studied sediments consist primarily of quartz, plagioclase, calcite and clay minerals, with the BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) surface areas of 61.7 m2 g−1 and 23.1 m2 g−1. Major elements of Ca, K, Mg and Al show different release rates under different solution pH values. With the decreasing solution pH, the release rates of Ca and K increase obviously, while the release rates of Mg and Al increase with the initial solution pH varying from 6.0 to 7.0. The different release rates of these elements are closely related to the original mineral composition of the sediments and the reaction kinetics. Based on the experimental observation, quartz and clay minerals that have low dissolution rates may dominate the major element release to the aqueous phase. This study reveals that the enhancing ocean acidification could cause considerable release of major elements from natural terrigenous sediments into the ambient marine environment, which has to be considered carefully in the future study on global change. © 2015, Science Press, Ocean University of China and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Changjiang Estuary; major elements; pH value; release rate; sediment","Alkattan, M., Oelkers, E.H., Dandurand, J.L., Schott, J., Experimental studies of halite dissolution kinetics, 1 the effect of saturation state and the presence of trace metals (1997) Chemical Geology, 137, pp. 201-219; Brady, P.V., Walther, J.V., Kinetics of quartz dissolution at low temperatures (1990) Chemical Geology, 82, pp. 253-264; Bruland, K.W., Donat, J.R., Hutchins, D.A., Interactive influences of bioactive trace metals on biological production in oceanic water (1991) Limnology and Oceanography, 36, pp. 1555-1577; Cai, W., Hu, X., Huang, W.J., Murrell, M.C., Lehrter, J.C., Lohrenz, S.E., Chou, W.C., Gong, G.C., Acidification of subsurface coastal waters enhanced by eutrophication (2011) Nature Geoscience, 4, pp. 766-770; Cappuyns, V., Swennen, R., Kinetics of element release during combined oxidation and pHstat leaching of anoxic river sediments (2005) Applied Geochemistry, 20, pp. 1169-1179; Chaïrat, C., Schott, J., Oelkers, E.H., Lartigue, J.E., Harouiya, N., Kinetics and mechanism of natural fluorapatite dissolution at 25°C and pH from 3 to 12 (2007) Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, 71, pp. 5901-5912; Chakraborty, P., Babu, P.V.R., Sarma, V.V., A study of lead and cadmium speciation in some estuarine and coastal sediments (2012) Chemical Geology, 294-295, pp. 217-225; Chen, C.C., Gong, G.C., Shiah, F.K., Hypoxia in the East China Sea: One of the largest coastal low-oxygen areas in the word (2007) Marine Environmental Research, 64, pp. 399-408; Chen, J.Y., Chen, S.L., Ecological environmental changes in the Changjiang estuary and suggestions for countermeasure (2003) Water Resources Hydropower Engineering, 34, pp. 19-25; Chen, Y., Brantley, S.L., Temperature- and pH- dependence of albite dissolution rate at acid pH (1997) Chemical Geology, 135, pp. 275-292; Cubillas, P., Köhler, S., Prieto, M., Chaïrat, C., Oelkers, E.H., Experimental determination of the dissolution rates of calcite, aragonite, and bivalves (2005) Chemical Geology, 216, pp. 59-77; Doney, S.C., The growing human footprint on coastal and open-ocean biogeochemistry (2010) Science, 328, pp. 1516-1525; Gautier, J.M., Oelkers, E.H., Schott, J., Experimental study of K-feldspar dissolution rates as a function of chemical affinity at 150°C and pH 9 (1994) Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, 58, pp. 4549-4560; Gherbi, C., Bouabse, L., Oelkers, E.H., An experimental study of lake water-sediment interaction rates (2010) Comptes Rendus Geoscience, 342, pp. 126-135; Gislason, S.R., Oelkers, E.H., Mechanism, rates, and consequences of basaltic glass dissolution: II.

In addition to the steelmaking processes, chemical processes such as pressure/temperature swing adsorption, membrane, chemical absorption technologies are included for gas treatment. A methanol plant integrated with a combined heat and power plant forms a polygeneration system that utilizes energy and gases of the site. The overall model has been applied using mathematical programming to find an optimal design and operation of the integrated plant for an economic objective under several development stages of the technology. New concepts studied are blast furnace operation with different degrees of top gas recycling and oxygen enrichment of the blast to full oxygen blast furnace. Coke in the process may be partially replaced with other carbon carriers. The system is optimized by maximizing the net present value, which includes investment costs for the new unit processes as well as costs of feed materials, CO2 emission and sequestration, operation costs and credit for products produced. The effect of using different fuels such as oil, natural gas, pulverized coal, coke oven gas, charcoal and biomass is studied, particularly focusing on biomass torrefaction and the effect of integration on arising reductant in steelmaking to reduce emissions from the system. The effects of steel plant capacity on the optimal choice of carbon carriers are also studied. It is demonstrated that it is possible to decrease the specific CO2 emissions of primary steelmaking from fossil fuels from 1.6t of CO2 to a level of 0.75-1.0t and further by more than 50% through the integration of biofuels in considered scenarios. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Blast furnace; Carbon dioxide emission; Reducing agents; Sustainable development; Torrefaction","Arens, M., Worrell, E., Diffusion of energy efficient technologies in the German steel industry and their impact on energy consumption (2014) Energy, 73, p. 968; Babich, A., Gudenau, H.W., Formoso, A., Mavrommatis, K.T., Froehling, C., Garcia, L., Choice of technological regimes of a blast furnace operation with injection of hot reducing gases (2002) Rev.

The effects of leaked CO2 on trace soil gas (e.g., methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in farmlands are not well-understood. This study simulated the effects of elevated soil CO2 on CH4 and N2O through pot experiments. The results revealed that significant increases of CH4 and N2O emissions were induced by the simulated CO2 leakages; the emission rates of CH4 and N2O were substantial, reaching about 222 and 48 times than that of the control, respectively. The absolute global warming potentials (GWPs) of the additional CH4 and N2O are considerable, but the cumulative GWPs of the additional CH4 and N2O only accounted for 0.03% and 0.06%, respectively, of the cumulative amount of leaked CO2 under high leakage conditions. The results demonstrate that leakage from CCS projects may lead to additional greenhouse gas emissions from soil; however, in general, the amount of additional CH4 and N2O emissions is negligible when compared with the amount of leaked CO2. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","CCS; CH4; GHG emission; Global warming potential; Leaked CO2; N2O","Beaubien, S.E., Ciotoli, G., Coombs, P., Dictor, M.C., Krüger, M., Lombardi, S., Pearce, J.M., West, J.M., The impact of a naturally occurring CO2 gas vent on the shallow ecosystem and soil chemistry of a Mediterranean pasture (Latera, Italy) (2008) Int.

Determining whether global warming increases likelihood assists in assessment of landslide-triggered tsunami hazards and risk to seafloor structures. Other studies propose that landslides helped to trigger past rapid climate change due to sudden release of gas hydrates. Two deep-water turbidite records show prolonged hiatuses in turbidity current activity during the Initial Eocene Thermal Maximum (IETM) at ~55 Ma. The IETM represents a possible proxy for future anthropogenically-induced climate change. It is likely that our records mainly represent large and fast moving disintegrative submarine landslides. Statistical analysis of long term (>2.3 Myr) records shows that turbidity current frequency significantly decreased after the IETM. Our results indicate that rapid climate change does not necessarily cause increased turbidity current activity, and do not provide evidence for landslides as a primary trigger for the IETM. © 2015 The Authors.","Gas hydrate; Geohazard; Global warming; IETM; PETM; Submarine landslide","Agnini, C., Fornaciari, E., Rio, D., Tateo, F., Backman, J., Giusberti, L., Responses of calcareous nannofossil assemblages, mineralogy and geochemistry to the environmental perturbations across the Paleocene/Eocene boundary in the Venetian Pre-Alps (2007) Mar.

A 3-year field experiment was conducted from 2010 to 2012 to investigate combined effect of straw and microbial inoculant on methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) in a rice field in Jurong, Jiangsu Province, China. The experiment was designed to have treatment NPK (N, P and K fertilizers only), treatment NPKS (NPK plus wheat straw), treatment NPKSR (NPKS plus Ruilaite microbial inoculant) and treatment NPKSJ (NPKS plus Jinkuizi microbial inoculant). Results show that compared to NPK, NPKS increased seasonal CH4 emission by 280-1370%, while decreasing N2O emission by 7-13%. When compared with NPKS, NPKSR and NPKSJ increased seasonal CH4 emission by 7-13% and 6-12%, respectively, whereas reduced N2O emission by 10-27% and 9-24%, respectively. The higher CH4 emission could be attributed to the higher soil CH4 production potential triggered by the combined application of straw and microbial inoculant, and the lower N2O emission to the decreased inorganic N content. As a whole, the benefit of lower N2O emission was completely offset by increased CH4 emission, resulting in a higher GWP for NPKSR (5-12%) and NPKSJ (5-11%) relative to NPKS. Due to NPKSR and NPKSJ increased rice grain yield by 3-6% and 2-4% compared to NPKS, the GHGI values for NPKS, NPKSR and NPKSJ were comparable. These findings suggest that incorporating straw together with microbial inoculant would not influence the radiative forcing of rice production in the terms of per unit of rice grain yield relative to the incorporation of straw alone. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Methane; Microbial inoculant; Nitrous oxide; Rice fields; Straw incorporation","Akiyama, H., Yagi, K., Yan, X.Y., Direct N2O emissions from rice paddy fields: summary of available data (2005) Glob.

As a result, much research efforts have been directed toward more effective measures for the carbon capture and storage (CCS). In this review, we first briefly described the general background on the various techniques available for the abatement of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions worldwide. Then, we provided an in-depth discussion regarding the two comparable control technologies, i.e., the amine- vs. ammonia-based capture approaches; ammonia has lower energy costs than monoethanolamine (MEA). The applicability of each method was described further with an emphasis on their advantages and disadvantages. We also briefly discussed the available options for post-absorption processing such as recovery of absorbed CO<inf>2</inf>, compression, and storage. Many immobilized amines as adsorbents can only be regenerated a few times or are a 'once-through process'. This may deplete the global supply of those materials if CCS is scaled up in excess of Mton CO<inf>2</inf> captured per year. Ideally, the captured CO<inf>2</inf> should be isolated from the atmosphere indefinitely and/or photochemically reduced (either biologically or industrially). Finally, we explored future challenges in this field of study to envision and suggest more optimized solutions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Amine; Ammonia; CO<inf>2</inf> capture; Global warming; Greenhouse gas","Ciais, P., Sabine, C., Bala, G., Bopp, L., Brovkin, V., Canadell, J., Carbon and other biogeochemical cycles (2013) Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA, , http://wwwipccch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/wg1ar5_chapter06_finalpdf, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, (Chapter 6, accessed November 2014), T.F.

The modeled NPP and NEP significantly increased by about 0.4PgCyr-2 and 0.09PgCyr-2, respectively, in response to the rising atmospheric CO2 concentration. However, adverse trends of the two variables were driven by climate change on a global scale. Regarding the spatial pattern, the decreases were mainly located in tropical and temperate regions. Thus, the terrestrial carbon sink was accelerated not only by a rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, but also by global warming at high latitude and altitude regions, e.g. Tibet and Alaska. Although the simulations indicated increases of NPP and NEP owing to the CO2 fertilization effect, the strength of the trends significantly differed from the CMIP5 models. The enhanced trend in the terrestrial carbon sink simulated by MPI-ESM-LR was about 47 times larger than that simulated by CESM-BGC considering the CO2 fertilization effect. Differences in the modeled responses of NPP and NEP resulted from the various processes of the land surface component accounting for the nitrogen limitation effect and plant functional types (PFTs). We also found that the difference in the accelerating terrestrial carbon loss forced by global warming between CMIP5 models, ranged between 6.0TgCyr-2 in CESM-BGC and 52.7TgCyr-2 in MPI-ESM-LR. Such a divergence was partially responsible for the difference in the simulated climate between the CMIP5 models: the difference in increasing temperature was about 1.4K. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Increasing CO2 concentration; NEP; NPP","Ahlström, A., Schurgers, G., Arneth, A., Smith, B., Robustness and uncertainty in terrestrial ecosystem carbon response to CMIP5 climate change projections (2012) Environ.

Furthermore, we would like to know, what we can do to reduce the carbon dioxide emission further and where it is most sensible to take action in order to do this.When renewable energy is introduced to replace the use of fossil fuels, a significant reduction of the carbon dioxide emission is to be expected, but it is not necessarily the case. To assess the carbon dioxide emission it is necessary to obtain knowledge about all the processes which involve carbon. Emission of a significant amount of carbon dioxide is the result of a number of natural processes for instance decomposition processes of organic matter in nature, and nature is also by the photosynthesis taking up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Therefore, in order to find the resulting net emission of carbon dioxide and answer the above mentioned questions, the development of a carbon cycling model (CCM) for the area or region is needed. A total of 26 different carbon pools are considered in the CCM of Samsø, including the various agricultural products, three fractions of carbon in soil, forests, wetlands, grasslands, straw used for heating and the production in the industry (Trolleborg). The transfer processes among the various pools are quite well known from literature and estimates of the agricultural and industrial production on the island can be derived from available data. It is furthermore known how much forest, wetland and grassland, that Samsø has and how many inhabitants that live on the island, how much solid waste they produce and how much carbon dioxide they respire. The CCM has been developed based on this knowledge and has furthermore been adapted to follow the annual variations.Due to the use of renewable energy, it can be shown by the CCM that Samsø to day net removes 26. 460. t carbon per year in form of carbon dioxide (97. 020. t/year of carbon dioxide is removed), while no carbon dioxide was net removed in 1997, before introduction of renewable energy on the island. The model is applied as environmental management tool. If it is assumed that Samsø is fossil fuel free and 5000. t carbon is removed by the use of supplementary crops, as much as almost 40. 000. t of carbon as carbon dioxide will be removed from the atmosphere. This amount corresponds also to more than the difference between carbon exported and imported, which means that Samsø is even removing in this case the carbon that is emitted as carbon dioxide in the towns when the agricultural production from Samsø is utilized as food.A clear improvement of the carbon dioxide is therefore possible by the use of these two measures: make Samsø a fossil fuel island and use supplementary crops. These applications of the CCM show that the model can be used as a powerful management tool. It is the intention to use the CCM in the coming years to find the solutions for the development of the energy use on Samsø that will yield the biggest reduction of the emission of carbon dioxide and other green house gases. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","A powerful environmental management tool; Carbon balance; Carbon cycling model; Carbon dioxide emission","Jørgensen, S.E., Bendoricchio, G., (2001) Fundamentals of Ecological Modelling, p. 628. , Elsevier, Amsterdam; Jørgensen, S.E., Fath, B., (2011) Fundamentals of Ecological Modelling, p. 400. , Elsevier, Amsterdam; Jørgensen, L.A., Jørgensen, S.E., Nielsen, S.N., (2000) Ecotox.

Diets containing corn (CS), whole plant grain sorghum (WPGS) or forage sorghum (FS) silages were fed to 6 primiparous Italian Friesian cows in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design. Diets were balanced to have 36.0 and 26.0% DM of NDF and starch, respectively. In each period cows were placed in individual respiration chambers to register CH<inf>4</inf> production. The GWP of milk production in the three different forage systems was evaluated through a ""cradle to farm-gate"" Life Cycle Assessment. All the emissions related to on-farm activities (forage production, fuel and electricity consumptions, manure and livestock management), off-farm activities (production of fertilizers, pesticides, bedding materials, purchased forages, concentrate feed, replacement animals, electricity, fuel) and transportation were considered. The functional unit was 1 kg FPCM. Enteric emission of CH<inf>4</inf> from cows was obtained with an in vivo experiment or predicted using an equation based on gross energy intake and on dietary NDF and ether extract.Dry matter intake (kg/day) tended to be higher for CS and WPGS (20.0 for both diets) than FS (18.2) (P = 0.07). Milk yield was 23.6, 24.6 and 25.4 kg/day for FS, WPGS and CS, respectively (P = 0.05 between CS and FS).On average, CH<inf>4</inf> from enteric fermentation and manure storage was the major contributor (45.4%) to GHG emission of milk production and 71.1% of the CH<inf>4</inf> was from enteric losses. Predicted CH<inf>4</inf> emission was slightly lower than the emission measured from in vivo trials (323 vs 340 g/day per cow on average). In vivo CH<inf>4</inf> production was not different among diets but intake energy lost as CH<inf>4</inf> was higher (P = 0.04) for FS (5.8%) in comparison with CS and WPGS (5.1 and 5.2% for CS and WPGS, respectively). Contribution of on-farm crop production to GWP was lower for sorghum scenarios, particularly FS, due to the reduced use of water and fertilizers. On the contrary purchased concentrate feed showed a great load on GWP (30%), especially in the FS scenario, because of the greater amount of corn meal needed to compensate for the low starch content of the sorghum silages. In conclusion the CS forage system gave higher milk production, lower CH<inf>4</inf> energy loss and lower GWP per kg FPCM than the sorghum forage systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Global warming potential; LCA; Methane; Milk; Sorghum silage","Amodeo, P., Produttività e costi dei foraggi più competitvi (2007) Informatore Agrario, 46, pp. 6-10; Aydin, G., Grant, R.J., O'Rear, J., Brown midrib sorghum in diets for lactating dairy cows (1999) J.

Carbon loss occurs primarily through soil respiration; it is known that respiration is sensitive to the global changes in [CO2] and temperature, suggesting that the net carbon balance may change in the future. However, field manipulations of temperature and [CO2] alter many important environmental factors so it is unclear how much of the observed alterations in soil respiration is due to changes of microbial function itself instead of changes to the physical and chemical environment. Here we focus on resolving the importance of changes in the microbial community in response to warming and elevated [CO2] on carbon mineralisation, something not possible in field measurements. We took plant material and soil inocula from a long running experiment where native grassland had been exposed to both warming and elevated CO2 and constructed a reciprocal transplant experiment. We found that the rate of decomposition (heterotrophic respiration) was strongly determined by the origin of the microbial community. The combined warming+elevated CO2 treatment produced a soil community that gave respiration rates 30% higher when provided with shoot litter and 70% for root litter than elevated CO2 treatment alone, with the treatment source of the litter being unimportant. Warming, especially in the presence of elevated CO2, increased the size of the apparent labile carbon pool when either C3 or C4 litter was added. Thus, the metabolic activity of the soil community was affected by the combination of warming and elevated CO2 such that it had an increased ability to mineralise added organic matter, regardless of its source. Therefore, soil C efflux may be substantially increased in a warmer, high CO2 world. Current ecosystem models mostly drive heterotrophic respiration from plant litter quality, soil moisture and temperature but our findings suggest equal attention will need to be paid to capturing microbial processes if we are to accurately project the future C balance of terrestrial ecosystems and quantify the feedback effect on atmospheric concentrations of CO2. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon mineralisation;

Here we investigated climate warming induced ecological changes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) over the past 50years on the basis of a large amount of in situ field observation and remote sensing data. We found that climate warming up to 0.41°C/10a has greatly improved the heat conditions on the TP, thus exhibits a growth of 46,000ha farmland during the past 30years, with the largest growth rate by 19% which occurred above 4000m. Terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) has increased by 0.002PgCa-1. Broad-leaved forest had the highest average NPP. Cultivated vegetation contributes most for causing NPP growth in the recent 30years. We also found that seasonal frozen soil depth decreased as the consequence of climate warming. Increased snow-melting inflated lake and river areas, whereas swamp area decreased owing to reduced moisture in the root zone. Freeze-thawing erosion decreased because of the reduced annual range of temperature. Understanding the ecological effects of climate change on the TP is of great significance to improve environmental management and promote sustainable development. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate warming; Ecosystem change; Remote sensing; Tibetan Plateau","Beaumont, L.J., Pitman, A., Perkins, S., Zimmermann, N.E., Yoccoz, N.G., Thuiller, W., Impacts of climate change on the world's most exceptional ecoregions (2011) Proc.

However, there are biodegradable waste treatment methods that could mitigate these challenges. This study analysed anaerobic digestion, composting, vermicomposting and fly larvae waste treatments using life cycle assessment (LCA). The impact categories assessed were energy use, global warming and eutrophication potential. The results showed that anaerobic digestion performed best in all impact categories assessed. However, management of the anaerobic digestion process is critical and methane losses must be kept very small, as otherwise they will cause global warming. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A two-box climate model is used to simulate temperatures of the atmosphere and ocean for different rates of mitigation. Mitigation rates for BC and CO2 are characterized by respective timescales for e-folding reduction in emissions intensity of gross global product. There are respective emissions models that force the box model. Lastly there is a simple economics model, with cost of mitigation varying inversely with emission intensity.Constant mitigation timescale corresponds to mitigation at a constant annual rate, for example an e-folding timescale of 40years corresponds to 2.5% reduction each year. Discounted present cost depends only on respective mitigation timescale and respective mitigation cost at present levels of emission intensity. Least-cost mitigation is posed as choosing respective e-folding timescales, to minimize total mitigation cost under a temperature constraint (e.g. within 2°C above preindustrial). Peak warming is more sensitive to mitigation timescale for CO2 than for BC. Therefore rapid mitigation of CO2 emission intensity is essential to limiting peak warming, but simultaneous mitigation of BC can reduce total mitigation expenditure. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Black carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change mitigation; Global climate change; Mitigation timescales; Mitigation tradeoffs","Allen, M.R., Stocker, T.F., Impact of delay in reducing carbon dioxide emissions (2014) Nat.

Rice and wheat were rotationally grown in a free-air O3 enrichment platform, and crop production and N2O, CH4, and CO2 emissions from the soils were investigated as well as the global warming potential (GWP) of the GHGs. Exposure to elevated O3 (50% greater than ambient O3) slightly reduced the total biomass of wheat and significantly decreased that of rice, significantly decreased the root to total biomass ratio of wheat and slightly increased that of rice. Elevated O3 significantly increased the CO2 emission but did not influence the CH4 and N2O emissions in the rice-soil system; however, elevated O3 did not influence the CO2 emission, significantly increased the CH4 emission, and significantly reduced N2O emissions in the root-free soil during the rice season. Elevated O3 increased the CO2 emission and decreased the CH4 and N2O emissions in the wheat-soil system and root-free soil during the wheat season, although the decrease in N2O emission in the wheat-soil system was not significant. The effects of elevated O3 on GHGs emissions and biomass accumulation were related to crop species, plant coverage, and GHG type. Elevated O3 significantly increased the GWP in the rice-soil system and the GWP per unit of rice yield; however, it did not change the GWP in the wheat-soil system or in the root-free soil during the wheat-rice growing period, nor did it change the GWP per unit of wheat yield. Considering the decreases in wheat and rice dry matter, reducing CO2 emissions and planting O3-tolerant crop cultivars during future elevated O3 scenarios, especially during the rice-growing season, should be a primary focus of the research aimed at reducing the GWP and increasing the soil C and N sequestration of rotational rice-wheat cropping systems. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Global climate change; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas; Ozone exposure; Rice-wheat rotation system","Andersen, C., Source-sink balance and carbon allocation below ground in plants exposed to ozone (2003) New Phytol., 157, pp. 213-228; Ashmore, M., Assessing the future global impacts of ozone on vegetation (2005) Plant Cell Environ., 28, pp. 949-964; Bhatia, A., Ghosh, A., Kumar, V., Tomer, R., Singh, S.D., Pathak, H., Effect of elevated tropospheric ozone on methane and nitrous oxide emission from rice soil in north India (2011) Agric.

Studies in arch dams show that thermal loads have the most significant effect for causing cracking than other service loads. Moreover, since researches on climate change announce that mean temperature on Earth is expected to increase, the assessment of the impact of the future temperature increase on the structural behaviour of sensitive infrastructures should be considered. This paper proposes a methodology for the assessment of the impacts of global warming on the structural behaviour of infrastructures. The paper links future climate scenarios to the thermal, stress and displacement fields of the structure. The methodology is illustrated with a case study: La Baells arch-dam. The expected stress and displacement fields of the dam under several future climatic scenarios were computed by finite element models. Concrete temperature are expected to increase up to 5.6. K, which will make annual average radial displacements increase in some cases even more than 100%. Tensile stresses are also projected to change and should be adequately monitored in the future. Finally, several adaptation strategies are outlined. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Arch dam; Climate change; Dam safety; Finite element method; Thermal analysis","Douglas, K.J., (2002) The shear strength of rock masses, , PhD thesis, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Mata, J., Interpretation of concrete dam behaviour with artificial neural network and multiple linear regression models (2011) Eng Struct, 33 (3), pp. 903-910; Mata, J., Tavares de Castro, A., Sá da Costa, J., Time-frequency analysis for concrete dam safety control: correlation between the daily variation of structural response and air temperature (2013) Eng Struct, 48, pp. 658-665; Mata, J., Tavares de Castro, A., Sá da Costa, J., Constructing statistical models for arch dam deformation (2013) Struct Control Health, 21 (3), pp. 423-437; Sheibany, F., Ghaemian, M., Effects of environmental action on thermal stress analysis of Karaj concrete arch dam (2006) J Eng Mech - ASCE, 132 (5), pp. 532-544; Jin, F., Chen, Z., Wang, J., Yang, J., Practical procedure for predicting non-uniform temperature on the exposed face of arch dams (2010) Appl Therm Eng, 30 (14), pp. 2146-2156; Summary for policymakers (2007) Climate change 2007: the physical science basis.

Conceptual process design, economic, environmental impacts and sensitivity analysis are developed for one fermentation process and three downstream processing routes, based on alkali, surfactant-hypochlorite and solvent treatments. Environmentally and cost-wise, the alkali treatment is the most favourable with production costs of 1.40€/kg PHB, global warming potential of 2.4kgCO2-eq/kg PHB and non-renewable energy use of 106MJ/kg PHB. The solvent-based process yields the highest costs and environmental burdens: 1.95€/kg PHB, 4.30kgCO2-eq/kg PHB and 156MJ/kg PHB. The production of PHB from wastewater is identified as an interesting alternative to pure culture-polyhydroxyalkanoates production from sugars. However, these results are not yet competitive with those for the petrochemical counterparts. Additional performance improvements may be possible, through process integration and optimisation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Circular economy; Economic evaluation; Life cycle assessment; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Waste valorisation","Akiyama, M., Tsuge, T., Doi, Y., Environmental life cycle comparison of polyhydroxyalkanoates produced from renewable carbon resources by bacterial fermentation (2003) Polym.

This paper analyses the appropriateness of available multifunctional modeling methods to distribute environmental loads between pig iron and bfs produced in the steelmaking process, and the influence that modeling choices have on LCA results for different blended cement types commercialized in Brazil. Methods Allocation by mass and by economic value, as well as system expansion, are examined for ordinary Portland cement and two types of blended cements with higher ggbfs contents as clinker replacement. The support platform used for performing the LCA was SimaPro 7.3, and the impact evaluation method was CML 2001 (baseline). The data for the production processes' modeling came from national and/or local reports; when national data were unavailable, the corresponding processes found in the SimaPro built-in Ecoinvent database were adapted to better represent the Brazilian context. Results and discussion As expected, impact allocation based on mass induces large impacts on bfs and the environmental loads of blended cements gradually increase with the increased bfs content. A similar trend was observed for economic allocation, except for global warming and terrestrial ecotoxicity, which are particularly sensitive to the allocation procedure choice. In the system expansion approach, impact values in all categories decreased with increased ggbfs content in cement. Conclusion Impact distribution across products is a legitimate way for an industry to be held accountable only for the true impacts of a given process. Each method presents its advantages and disadvantages. Independently of the criterion chosen, the conceptual limitations of allocation methods are that they do not look beyond impacts partitioning, and awkward ratios between physical characteristics and market value blur the vision and distort results. In our case, the system expansion approach precisely modeled the studied processes, following a complete and conceptually consistent description, which also allows for consideration of potential improvements at whole-system level. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This process can capture the CO2 released during industrial processes and store it deep in geological sites. However, there is a possible risk that the CO2 might leak from underground. Therefore, detecting sites of CO2 leakage is important for the safety and success of CCS projects. The remote sensing of plants offers the potential to identify locations of CO2 leakage from the spectral responses of the plants growing on the surface of sequestration fields. A field experiment was performed at the Sutton Bonington campus of University of Nottingham (52.8N, 1.2W) that aimed to study the spectral characteristics of maize (Zea mays L.), beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.), cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.), lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) under CO2 leakage and waterlogging stress conditions, to develop a new method for distinguishing between species growing under CO2 leakage and waterlogging stresses, and to determine which plant was most sensitive to CO2 leakage stress.Leaf spectra were measured and processed using smoothing, continuum removal and first-derivative methods. For maize, cabbage, lettuce and bean, as the severity of CO2 leakage stress increased, the areas of the 510-545nm regions of the first-derivative spectral curves increased, and those of the 690-750nm regions decreased compared with the controls. However, for beetroot, the area of the 510-545nm region of the first-derivative spectral curve decreased, and that of the 690-750nm region increased compared with the control. When exposed to waterlogging stress, the areas of both the 510-545nm and the 690-750nm regions of the first-derivative spectral curves decreased compared with the controls for all 5 species examined. The areas of the 510-545nm and 690-750nm regions of the first-derivative spectral curves were named the AREAgreen and AREAred, respectively. Furthermore, the AREAred/AREAgreen ratio was able to effectively identify the species exposed to CO2 leakage stress, and the product of AREAred×AREAgreen accurately identified the species under waterlogging stress.These results suggest that the spectral responses of plants to CO2 leakage and waterlogging stresses are different and that the AREAred/AREAgreen and AREAred×AREAgreen indices can effectively distinguish the treated plants and the control plants, respectively. Cabbage is the most sensitive of the examined species to the CO2 leakage stress, followed by maize, beetroot and lettuce, and then bean, the least sensitive plant species. This experiment suggests that leaf reflectance can be adopted to detect plants that grow in regions of high soil CO2 leakage moreover, the species' responses to CO2 leakage stress and waterlogging stress can be differentiated. Nevertheless, to accurately detect locations of CO2 leakage in fields and determining whether the models are suitable for airborne or satellite data, large-scale field experiments must also be performed in the near future. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 leakage; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Identification model; Plant stress; Waterlogging","Al-Traboulsi, M., Sjögersten, S., Colls, J., Steven, M., Craigon, J., Black, C., Potential impact of CO2 leakage from carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems on growth and yield in spring field bean (2012) Environ.

In a companion paper, we analyzed the states of permafrost degradation under road embankments in the five typical regions along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway (Yu et al., 2013a). In this paper, the states of permafrost degradation under natural ground surfaces, near the road embankments, are analyzed based on up to 15. years of in-situ geothermal data, while that under road embankments are also further analyzed. On this basis, the states of permafrost degradation and related processes are compared between the natural ground surfaces and road embankments. Possible influences of climate warming and road embankment on permafrost degradation are discussed. The results show different characteristics of permafrost degradation under natural ground surfaces and road embankments.

However, the causes are still under debate, particularly with regard to the pattern, timing of the biocalcification crisis, relative roles of intrinsic and extrinsic processes as drivers of the crisis, and also causal mechanisms of the T-OAE.In this study, a new quantification of Toarcian calcareous nannofossil abundance and size is presented for the Sancerre borehole (Paris Basin, France). Beyond the recognition of a severe biocalcification crisis defined by the major drop in abundance, and the reduction in size of the most important pelagic carbonate producer Schizosphaerella punctulata, for the first time, this study proposes an insight into the pace and timing of the nannoplankton crisis. At Sancerre, the carbonate production of the lower Toarcian sediments previously attributed to obliquity forcing of climate allows estimating a duration of ~. 210. kyr for the biocalcification crisis and of ~. 120. kyr for the shift towards lower carbon isotope values. The onset of the biocalcification crisis marked by a fertility event lasted ~. 60. kyr, and the calcium carbonate values remained low for ~. 150. kyr; the subsequent recovery of carbonate and nannoplankton lasted ~. 60. kyr and >. 550. kyr, respectively. Additionally, a link between the biocalcification crisis, the seawater palaeotemperature, and the carbon isotope steps can be demonstrated. This covariance provides compelling evidence of fundamental change in the response of the climatic warming and the carbon cycle systems triggering the biocalcification crisis. These observations indicate that the biocalcification crisis can be regarded as a direct or indirect consequence of a global warming. Moreover, a deficiency of the biological pump is proposed here, as a complementary causal mechanism for explaining the negative carbon-isotope excursion. © 2015.","Biocalcification crisis; Calcareous nannofossils; Carbonate production; Early Toarcian","Aitchison, J., Simplicial inference (2002) Contemporary Mathematics Series, 287, pp. 1-22. , American Mathematical Society, Providence, Rhode Island (USA), M.A.G.

For a few decades the scientific community generally adopted dynamical models - the so-called Global Climate Models (GCMs) - for such an investigation. These models show the essential role of anthropogenic forcings in driving the temperature behaviour of the last half century. In the last period even other (data-driven) methodological approaches were adopted for attribution studies. This allows the scientific community to compare the results coming from these different approaches and to possibly increase their robustness. For such a purpose, the paper explores the possibility of applying a robustness framework, so far used only in the case of multi-model GCM ensembles, to a strategy including models from different methodological orientations, assessing such an application especially in the light of the independence issue. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Attribution; Climate change; Climate modelling; Complex systems; Data-driven modelling; Dynamical modelling; Granger causality; Multi-model ensembles; Neural networks; Robustness analysis; Scientific uncertainty","Abramowitz, G., Model independence in multi-model ensemble prediction (2010) Aust.

This study addresses how different climate policy pathways indirectly bear upon air pollution in terms of improved human health in Europe. To this end, we put in perspective mitigation costs and monetised health benefits of reducing PM2.5 (particles less than 2.5μm in diameter) and ozone concentrations. Air quality in Europe and related health impacts were assessed using a comprehensive modelling chain, based on global and regional climate and chemistry-transport models together with a health impact assessment tool. This allows capturing both the impact of climate policy on emissions of air pollutants and the geophysical impact of climate change on air quality. Results are presented for projections at the 2050 horizon, for a set of consistent air pollution and climate policy scenarios, combined with population data from the UN's World Population Prospects, and are expressed in terms of morbidity and mortality impacts of PM2.5 and ozone pollution and their monetised damage equivalent.The analysis shows that enforcement of current European air quality policies would effectively reduce health impacts from PM2.5 in Europe even in the absence of climate policies (life years lost from the exposure to PM2.5 decrease by 78% between 2005 and 2050 in the reference scenario), while impacts for ozone depend on the ambition level of international climate policies. A move towards stringent climate policies on a global scale, in addition to limiting global warming, creates co-benefits in terms of reduced health impacts (68% decrease in life years lost from the exposure to PM2.5 and 85% decrease in premature deaths from ozone in 2050 in the mitigation scenario relative to the reference scenario) and air pollution cost savings (77%) in Europe. These co-benefits are found to offset at least 85% of the additional cost of climate policy in this region. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Air pollution; Climate change; Cost-benefit analysis; Damage valuation; Health impacts; Mitigation costs","Abbey, D.E., Hwang, B.L., Burchette, R.J., Estimated long-term ambient concentrations of PM10 and development of respiratory symptoms in a nonsmoking population (1995) Arch.

Included is a novel method for designing recycled aggregate concretes, named Equivalent Mortar Volume. The evaluation is done by comparing certain key life cycle stages of four concretes, two designed through the proposed method and two others designed through widely known methods. These experimentally assessed concretes have equal sets of properties in terms of mechanical resistance, durability, and workability. According to the calculated emission quantities, concretes designed using the novel method show better environmental performance than their counterparts in all of the selected impact categories. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there may be yield reductions in the Northeastern region of Brazil due to possible future reductions in rainfall levels. The aim of this study was to simulate, using the Century 4.5 model, the impact of climate changes on potential sugarcane yield in Goiana and Itambé, Zona da Mata of Pernambuco. The Century 4.5 model was booted with soil and climate data from 1950 to 2012. Data on total soil carbon, soil texture (sand, silt and clay contents), pH, soil density and soc stocks were obtained from previous studies. The climate scenario used was the average emissions SRES A1B, designed by Eta/CPTEC model for periods 2014-2040, 2041-2070 and 2071-2100, which is composed of LOW member (low emissions) and HIGH member (high emissions). According to the results obtained by A1B scenario, the potential yield can be reduced in the near future (2014-2040). The high temperatures in northeastern Brazil will increase the evapotranspiration rates, reducing the amount of water available in the soil, making the planting of sugarcane increasingly difficult, which tend to be strongly reduced in drier areas, such as cities located in the western portion of the Zona da Mata region, northern state of Pernambuco, Brazil. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Century 4.5 model; Future climate scenarios; Global warming; Sugarcane","Salati, E., Santos, A.A., Nobre, C., As mudanças climáticas globais e seus efeitos nos ecossistemas brasileiros http://www.comciencia.br/report%20agens/clima/clima14.htm#2, Available in: [accessed May 2011]Raupach, M.R., Marland, G., Ciais, P., Le Quere, C., Canadell, J.G., Klepper, G., Global and regional drivers of accelerating CO2 emissions (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 104 (24), pp. 10288-10293; Canadell, J.G., Le Quere, C., Raupach, M.R., Field, C.B., Buitenhuis, E.T., Ciais, P., Contributions to accelerating atmospheric CO2 growth from economic activity, carbon intensity, and efficiency of natural sinks (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 104 (47), pp. 18866-18870; (2007) Climate change 2007: the physical science basis, , http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf, Available in, [accessed April 2011]; Marengo, J.A., Chou, S.C., Kay, G., Alves, L., Pesquero, J.F., Soares, W.R., Development of regional future climate change scenarios in South America using the Eta CPTEC/HadCM3 climate change projections: climatology and regional analyses for the Amazon, São Francisco and the Paraná River basins (2012) Clim Dyn, 38, pp. 1829-1848; Pinto, H.S., Assad, E.D., Junior, J.Z., Evangelista, S.R.M., Otavian, A.F., Ávila, A.M.H., (2008) Aquecimento global e a nova geografia da produção agrícola no Brasil, , Embrapa, São Paulo; Siqueira, O.J., Efeitos Potenciais das Mudanças Climáticas na Agricultura Brasileira e Estratégias Adaptativas para Algumas Culturas (2001) Mudanças Climáticas Globais e a Agropecuária Brasileira, pp. 65-96. , Embrapa Meio Ambiente, Jaguariúna, SP, M.A.D.

We employed relative Akaike information criterion (AIC), area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and Hosmer-Lemeshow’s goodness-of-fit statistic for model evaluation and validation.• Results: We found that tree mortalities of the three species could be better predicted (AUC > 0.8) by carefully selecting variables at three ecological scales (individual, stand, and regional climate). Our results suggest that the higher mortality of the object trees occurs when they endure lower radial growth of the previous years, more intensive competition, and moderate canopy cover (for birch), while lower mortality was seen in an appropriate range of climate conditions and at higher stand canopy cover (for fir and oak).• Conclusion: The results have significance for incorporating the effects of a changing climate into mortality models. © 2015, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.","Canopy cover; Climate warming; Competition; Logistic regression; Temperature; Tree mortality","Adame, P., Del Río, M., Canellas, I., Modeling individual-tree mortality in Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) stands (2010) Ann For Sci, 67 (8), p. 810; Allen, C.D., Macalady, A.K., Chenchouni, H., Bachelet, D., McDowell, N., Vennetier, M., Kitzberger, T., Cobb, N., A global overview of drought and heat-induced tree mortality reveals emerging climate change risks for forest (2010) For Ecol Manag, 259, pp. 660-684; Bigler, C., Bugmann, H., Growth-dependent tree mortality models based on tree rings (2003) Can J For Res, 33, pp. 210-221; Bigler, C., Bugmann, H., Predicting the time of tree death using dendrochronological data (2004) Ecol Appl, 14, pp. 902-914; Bigler, C., Gricar, J., Bugmann, H., Cufar, K., Growth patterns as indicators of impending tree death in silver fir (2004) For Ecol Manag, 199, pp. 183-190; Brando, P.M., Balch, J.K., Nepstad, D.C., Morton, D.C., Putz, F.E., Coe, M.T., Silvério, D., Soares-Filho, B.S., Abrupt increases in Amazonian tree mortality due to drought-fire interactions (2014) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 111, pp. 6347-6352. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXmtlWru78%3D, PID: 24733937; Buford, M.A., Hafley, W.L., Probability-distributions as models for mortality (1985) Forest Sci, 31, pp. 331-341; Castagneri, D., Lingua, E., Vacchiano, G., Nola, P., Motta, R., Diachronic analysis of individual-tree mortality in a Norway spruce stand in the eastern Italian Alps (2010) Ann For Sci, 67, p. p304; Cawley, G.C., Talbot, N.L.C., On over-fitting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation (2010) J Mach Learn Res, 11, pp. 2079-2107; Chen, H.Y.H., Fu, S., Monserud, R.A., Gillies, I.C., Relative size and stand age determine Pinus banksiana mortality (2008) For Ecol Manag, 255, pp. 3980-3984; Clark, D.B., Clark, D.A., Abundance, growth and mortality of very large trees in neotropical lowland rain forest (1996) For Ecol Manag, 80, pp. 235-244; Connell, J.H., Apparent versus “real” competition in plants (1990) Perspectives on plant competition, pp. 9-26. , Grace JB, Tilman D, (eds), Academic, San Diego:; Contreras, M.A., Affleck, D., Chung, W., Evaluating tree competition indices as predictors of basal area increment in western Montana forests (2011) For Ecol Manag, 262, pp. 1939-1949; Crecente-Campo, F., Marshall, P., Rodrı’guez-Soalleiro, R., Modeling non-catastrophic individual-tree mortality for Pinus radiate plantations in northwestern Spain (2009) For Ecol Manag, 257, pp. 1542-1550; Davies, S.J., Tree mortality and growth in 11 sympatricMacaranga species in Borneo (2001) Ecology, 82, pp. 920-932; de Toledo, J.J., Magnusson, W.E., Castilho, C.V., Nascimento, H.E.M., How much variation in tree mortality is predicted by soil and topography in Central Amazonia?

These words may summarize a whole new attitude towards our world and the people who live in it. This paper’s goal is to define an original multi-criteria energy model, named SRIME, specially designed for developing countries. First, an extensive research will be carried out on: energy demand; potential renewable energy, its current know-how and potential future development; potential avoided emissions (CO<inf>2</inf>, NO<inf>X</inf>, SO<inf>2</inf>); and the possible international support versus the in-country possibilities. The precedence constraints will be applied to establish in which degree renewable energy may be substituting for the fossil fuel: the purely economic approach will give way to a sustainable, renewable, development focused energy planning. It must be noted that an innovative function has been specifically included in the SRIME, which evaluates, applying the precedence constraints, the influence renewable energy may have on developing countries rural health and education. Six functions have been established: replaceable amount of fossil energy; CO<inf>2</inf>, NO<inf>X</inf> and SO<inf>2</inf> avoidable emissions; rural health and education development maximization; and the cost function. These functions will be optimized through the Chebyshev distance (L<inf>∞</inf>) compromise programming minimization, so that the Pareto optimal solution may be obtained. © 2015, The Author(s).","Avoided emissions; Developing countries; Global warming; Multi-criteria decision making; Renewable and sustainable energy planning","Marcos, F., (1985) Aplicación de las técnicas multidimensionales a la planificación energética, pp. 97-104. , Julio Agosto, Energía:; http://www.iit.upcomillas.es/~pedrol/documents/energia97.pdf, Linares P.: Una aplicación de la programación multiobjetivo a la planificación eléctrica.

The composition of vetiver leaves from the experimental analysis revealed that vetiver is rich in cellulose (32.6%), hemicellulose (31.5%) and lignin (17.3%) that could be used as a feedstock for biorefinery. The comparative life cycle assessment results show that the carbon dioxide emission and fossil oil depletion could be reduced by 95% and 23% respectively in case of standalone bioethanol system, and 99% and 17% respectively in case of bioethanol and furfural system compared to that of conventional petrol and furfural systems.

Projections of further changes in the SOS for the 21st century under certain emissions scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways, RCPs) are useful for improving understanding of the consequences of global warming. In this study, we first evaluate a linear relationship between the SOS (defined using the normalized difference vegetation index) and the April temperature for most land areas of the Northern Hemisphere for 1982–2008. Based on this relationship and the ensemble projection of April temperature under RCPs from the latest state-of-the-art global coupled climate models, we show the possible changes in the SOS for most of the land areas of the Northern Hemisphere during the 21st century. By around 2040–59, the SOS will have advanced by −4.7 days under RCP2.6, −8.4 days under RCP4.5, and −10.1 days under RCP8.5, relative to 1985–2004. By 2080–99, it will have advanced by −4.3 days under RCP2.6, −11.3 days under RCP4.5, and −21.6 days under RCP8.5. The geographic pattern of SOS advance is considerably dependent on that of the temperature sensitivity of the SOS. The larger the temperature sensitivity, the larger the date-shift-rate of the SOS. © 2015, Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","CMIP5; normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs); start of growing season (SOS); temperature sensitivity","Chen, X.Q., Pan, W.F., Relationships among phenological growing season, time-integrated normalized difference vegetation index and climate forcing in the temperate region of eastern China (2002) Int.

Former experiments on rotating electric synchronous machines like motors and generators in the power range up to several MW confirmed the well-known benefits of HTS machines like smaller size, less weight and last but not least, a significantly increased efficiency. Especially the increased efficiency of large HTS-Generators up to several hundreds of MW - as operated by utilities - promises an efficient use of fuel and energy sources. This will allow reduced carbon dioxide emissions and becomes more and more important. The development of HTS rotor technology for generators in the range of hundreds of MW bears new challenges. HTS generator windings capable to withstand large centrifugal forces and carrying large currents are required. Also a special cooling system for the rotating winding and further components with novel design will be necessary and have to be developed. In a future HTS generator based on such components, these will have to operate very reliably, so a facility is needed to be able to perform tests. Therefore it is essential to design and build a specific test rig for investigation and test of the required new components. The present paper deals with design and development of such a test rig that allows component tests under realistic conditions, using radii in the range of 0.45 m as in a generator application at rotational speed of up to 3000 rpm, and at low operating temperatures of about 30 K. Additionally a 3 kA high current power supply for HTS test objects like coils or contacts is projected. Aspects of rotor dynamics and fatigue strength analysis had to be considered. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","generator; high temperature superconductor; HTS; Roebel cable; test facility","Neumüller, H.W., Advances in and prospects for development of high-temperature superconductor rotating machines at Siemens (2006) Supercond.

The global warming and the intensification of the intercontinental travel constitute a risk of the re-emergence of the malaria in Europe, given the presence of the Anopheles vectors. The study has attempted the identification by using the PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) of the members of the Anopheles maculipennis complex from the North-eastern area of Romania from the city of Iaşi. In total there have been identified by using the PCR amplifying the ITS2 sequence of the ribosomal DNA, 217 specimens belonging to the complex of A. maculipennis among which: 58 A. atroparvus, 18 A. melanoon, 2 A. labranchiae, 52 A. maculipennis and 87 A. messeae. The ITS2 sequences of the ribosomal DNA have been compared to those of the species belonging to the A. maculipennis available in GenBank. The Species A. labranchiae is reported for the first time in Romania, being identified in the larval stage IV. The adaptation of a new species to the climatic conditions present in the North-eastern Romania, confirms the phenomenon of global warming and also the intensification of the travelling. As a result of the analysis of the A. labranchiae sequence, this one corresponds to the extent of 96% to the species from Italy, registered in GenBank, given the fact that a high number of the inhabitants of the municipality of Iaşi are working in this country. © W.

This paper evaluates the eco-efficiency of the manufacturing sector in Malaysia by taking into account both economic and ecological factors (i.e. air pollution). Manufacturing activities produce pollutants that can contribute to poor environmental performance and are regarded as undesirable outputs. Thus, it would be incomplete to measure the efficiency of manufacturing activities without considering the undesirable outputs. This study employs the Range Adjusted Measure (RAM) model which accounts for both desirable and undesirable outputs in the production process. The results show that the Malaysian manufacturing industry as a whole has an average unified eco-efficiency score of 94% (category 1) in 2010 which indicates scope for reduction of inputs and pollutants as much as 6%. The results also reveal that, on average, the eco-efficiency score of the free industrial or free trade zone states are higher than non-free industrial zone states. This may be due to two reasons, first, manufacturers in the free industrial zones are export orientated and learning effects are gained from export participation which help firms improve their efficiency over time. Second, the firms enjoy duty free imports of raw materials as well as are exempt from various taxes and duties that help reduce production costs. The empirical evidence in this study may provide some directions in formulating policies, laws, regulations and strategies pertaining to any environmental performance issue particularly concerning environmental damage caused by industrial pollutants so that the productivity growth is in balance with environmental performance. © 2015 .","Eco-efficiency; Export; Manufacturing; Range Adjusted Measure (RAM); Undesirable output","Ahmed, E.M., Carbon dioxide emissions, impact on Malaysia's manufacturing productivity growth (2006) World Rev.

An Empirical Downscaling Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (EDDICE) is deployed using an optimal scenario for Malaysia against a baseline scenario of existing conditions following the top-down disaggregation strategy recommended by other studies. The model takes account of various climatic variables, including, temperature, carbon cycle, carbon emission, climatic damage, carbon control, and carbon concentration, which was adapted from observational records of climatic changes caused by global warming from 2010 to 2105. The results are interesting in prioritizing climate change mitigation for the future. Whereas the cumulative cost of climatic damage over the period 2010-2105 will amount to MYR40,128.1 billion under the present climatic regime in Malaysia, it will fall to MYR5263.7 billion under the optimal regime. In addition, the government would have collected revenue from carbon taxes amounting to MYR9535.4 billion over the 95 years. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon emission projections; Climate change; Mitigation policy","Al-Amin, A.Q., Leal Filho, W., A return to prioritizing needs: adaptation or mitigation alternatives?

An improved understanding of the fate of this remobilized soil OC is essential for better understanding of the consequences for the Arctic and global carbon cycle. In this study, glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) and bacteriohopanepolyols (BHPs) in surface sediments along a 500km cross shelf transect from the mouth of the Kolyma River to the middle of the vast East Siberian Sea were analysed to assess their potential and that of the associated branched and isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) and R'<inf>soil</inf> indices for tracing terrOC in Arctic systems. Both BHP and GDGT contributions indicated the greatest contribution of terrOC close to the river mouth, while the associated indices showed declining trends in an offshore direction, supporting an increasing marine OC input and/or a decrease in terrOC. However, while the BHPs indicated a dominance of terrOC at the start of the transect, the GDGTs suggested a much larger, almost 50%, marine OC input at this point. In addition, the BIT index displayed an exponential decline, controlled mainly by a substantial contribution of marine GDGTs, while R'<inf>soil</inf> revealed a linear trend governed primarily by the removal of soil marker BHPs. These field results suggest that both biomarker approaches could be used to trace terrigenous derived OC in the Arctic environment. However, using a single proxy approach is not recommended and may lead to an under or over estimation of the relative importance of terrOC. Using a multi-proxy approach is valuable for fully understanding the fate of terrigenous derived OC along Arctic land-ocean transects. © 2015 The Authors.","Bacteriohopanepolyols; BIT; East Siberian Sea; Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether; Kolyma River; R'<inf>soil</inf>; River-sea transect","(2004) Impacts of a Warming Arctic: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Alling, V., Sanchez-Garcia, L., Porcelli, D., Pugach, S., Vonk, J.E., van Dongen, B., Mörth, C.-M., Gustafsson, Ö., Nonconservative behavior of dissolved organic carbon across the Laptev and East Siberian seas (2010) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 24, p.

However, with changing climate and air pollution levels, solar resources may no longer be stable over time and undergo substantial decadal changes. Observational records covering the past decades confirm long-term changes in this quantity. Here we examine how the latest generation of climate models used for the 5th IPCC report projects potential changes in surface solar radiation over the coming decades, and how this may affect, in combination with the expected greenhouse warming, solar power output from photovoltaic (PV) systems. For this purpose, projections up to the mid 21st century from 39 state of the art climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are analysed globally and for selected key regions with major solar power production capacity. The large model ensemble allows to assess the degree of consistency of their projections. Models are largely consistent in the sign of the projected changes in solar radiation under cloud-free conditions as well as surface temperatures over most of the globe, while still reasonably consistent over a considerable part of the globe in the sign of changes in cloudiness and associated changes in solar radiation. A first order estimate of the impact of solar radiation and temperature changes on energy yields of PV systems under the RPC8.5 scenario indicates statistically significant decreases in PV outputs in large parts of the world, but notable exceptions with positive trends in large parts of Europe, South-East of North America and the South-East of China. Projected changes between 2006 and 2049 under the RCP8.5 scenario overall are on the order of 1%/decade for horizontal planes, but may be larger for tilted or tracked planes as well as on shorter (decadal) timescales. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change and model projections; Future PV system energy yields; Global dimming and brightening; Solar radiation changes; Solar resource assessment","Allan, R.P., Soden, B.J., Large discrepancy between observed and simulated precipitation trends in the ascending and descending branches of the tropical circulation (2007) Geophys.

A body of knowledge exists relating these traits to evolutionary pressures. In this study,we formalize this knowledge into general mathematical assumptions, and use them in an ecoevolutionary model. In contrast to previous models, this study novelty accounts for both traits—arrival date and hatching date—and the interdependence between them, revealing when one, the other or both will respond to climate. For all models sharing the assumptions, the following phonological responses will occur. First, if the nestling-prey peak is late enough, hatching is synchronous with, and arrival date evolves independently of, prey phenology. Second, when resource availability constrains the length of the pre-laying period, hatching is adaptively asynchronous with prey phenology. Predictions for both traits comparewell with empirical observations. In response to advancing prey phenology, arrival date may advance, remain unchanged, or even become delayed; the latter occurring when egg-laying resources are only available relatively late in the season. The model shows that asynchronous hatching and unresponsive arrival date are not sufficient evidence that phonological adaptation is constrained. The work provides a framework for exploring microevolution of interdependent phenological traits. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.","Adaptive dynamics; Climate change; Ficedula; Microevolution; Migratory bird; Phenology","Parmesan, C., Yohe, G., A globally coherent fingerprint of climate change impacts across natural systems (2003) Nature, 421, pp. 37-42; Schwartz, M.D., Ahas, R., Aasa, A., Onset of spring starting earlier across the Northern Hemisphere (2006) Glob.

This study quantifies the energy and resource demands of small-scale HP projects and presents methods to reduce associated environmental impacts based on potential growth in the sector. The environmental burdens of three (50-650 kW) run-of-river HP projects were calculated using life cycle assessment (LCA). The global warming potential (GWP) for the projects to generate electricity ranged from 5.5-8.9 g CO<inf>2</inf> eq/kWh, compared with 403 g CO<inf>2</inf> eq/kWh for UK marginal grid electricity. A sensitivity analysis accounted for alternative manufacturing processes, transportation, ecodesign considerations, and extended project lifespan. These findings were extrapolated for technically viable HP sites in Europe, with the potential to generate 7.35 TWh and offset over 2.96 Mt of CO<inf>2</inf> from grid electricity per annum. Incorporation of ecodesign could provide resource savings for these HP projects: avoiding 800 000 tonnes of concrete, 10 000 tonnes of steel, and 65 million vehicle miles. Small additional material and energy contributions can double a HP system lifespan, providing 39-47% reductions for all environmental impact categories. In a world of finite resources, this paper highlights the importance of HP as a resource-efficient, renewable energy system. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"(2014) Renewable Energy in 2013, , DECC.

Because TC intensification is significantly controlled by atmosphere and ocean environments, changes in these environments may cause changes in TC intensity. Changes in surface and subsurface ocean conditions can both influence a TC's intensification. Regarding global warming, minimal exploration of the subsurface ocean has been undertaken. Here we investigate future subsurface ocean environment changes projected by 22 state-of-the-art climate models and suggest a suppressive effect of subsurface oceans on the intensification of future TCs. Under global warming, the subsurface vertical temperature profile can be sharpened in important TC regions, which may contribute to a stronger ocean coupling (cooling) effect during the intensification of future TCs. Regarding a TC, future subsurface ocean environments may be more suppressive than the existing subsurface ocean environments. This suppressive effect is not spatially uniform and may be weak in certain local areas. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Despite enormous progress having been made in predicting ISMR since 1886, the operational forecasts during recent decades (1989-2012) have little skill. Here we show, with both dynamical and physical-empirical models, that this recent failure is largely due to the models' inability to capture new predictability sources emerging during recent global warming, that is, the development of the central-Pacific El Nino-Southern Oscillation (CP-ENSO), the rapid deepening of the Asian Low and the strengthening of North and South Pacific Highs during boreal spring. A physical-empirical model that captures these new predictors can produce an independent forecast skill of 0.51 for 1989-2012 and a 92-year retrospective forecast skill of 0.64 for 1921-2012. The recent low skills of the dynamical models are attributed to deficiencies in capturing the developing CP-ENSO and anomalous Asian Low. The results reveal a considerable gap between ISMR prediction skill and predictability. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

They cause toxicity problems, bad odors, global warming, etc. Methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) is used in the formulation of lacquer type paints, varnishes, cleaners, thinners, etc. and in many other industries such as the manufacture of synthetic leather and in the decaffeination of coffee. Released into the environment, it causes respiratory, eye, and skin health problems. At high concentrations, it poses a potential threat to public health. In recent years, effective, very environmentally sound, and economical organic biological waste gas treatment processes have emerged. The sources of degrading micro-organisms are diverse and activated sludge suspensions are widely used. Actinomycetes are known for their ability to degrade various polymers. In this study, we are interested in isolating actinobacteria from activated sludge from the wastewater treatment plant of El Athmania, Mila. Thus, five actinomycetes were isolated on ISP4 medium supplemented with nystatin at 100 μg/ml and nalidixic acid at 10 μg/ml. These isolates proved to degrade efficiently MEK in batch reactors. Growth kinetics were determined for each isolate. The time course of MEK consumption was also measured by gas chromatography. A strain named A5.7 stood out as the best degrading bacterium. Indeed, complete degradation of the substrate was achieved after only 72 h of incubation. The A5.7 isolate was assigned by morphological and cultural methods to the genus Streptomyces. © 2015 Balaban Desalination Publications.

Methods: Using 454 pyrosequencing, the 16S rRNA gene was analyzed from various bacterial communities in a rice paddy that was exposed to different atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> concentrations (ambient, +200 μmol.mol−1) and soil temperatures (ambient, +2 °C). Results: The treatments of elevated temperature and elevated CO<inf>2</inf> plus temperature exerted significant influence on the structure of bacterial communities from the lower leaf endosphere. A significant influence of elevated CO<inf>2</inf> plus temperature on the community structure was also observed in the upper leaf phyllosphere. The richness and diversity of bacterial communities from the lower leaf phyllosphere, upper leaf endosphere, and upper leaf phyllosphere were significantly affected by elevated CO<inf>2</inf> plus temperature. However, we did not observe any significant influence of all climate change treatments (elevated CO<inf>2</inf>, elevated temperature, and their combination) on the richness, diversity, and structure of soil bacterial communities. We also did not observe any significant effect of the single factor, elevated CO<inf>2</inf>, on the structure of the leaf endosphere and phyllosphere bacterial communities. Enterobacteriaceae and Xanthomonadaceae were the most shifted phylotypes in response to elevated temperature and elevated CO<inf>2</inf> plus temperature. Conclusions: Soil bacterial communities were more resistant to the tested climate change factors compare with foliar bacterial communities. Temperature was a more important factor in shaping the structure of foliar bacterial communities compared with CO<inf>2</inf>. The response of leaf-associated bacterial communities could be influenced by the leaf location (upper leaf or lower leaf) within the rice plants and by the habitats (leaf endosphere or phyllosphere). © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland","Climate change; Free air CO<inf>2</inf> enrichment (FACE); Global warming; Leaf-associated bacteria; Microbial community; Pyrosequence",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929448668

Global Warming raises concerns over the fate of these stenothermal fish, as their adaptation has been accompanied by irreversible genomic losses, which suggest a poor genetic potential to adapt to warmer climates. Specifically, this review focuses on adaptation of proteins belonging to the globin superfamily, which include the respiratory proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin and the non-respiratory proteins neuroglobin and cytoglobin.

The heat-integrated process was designed to be energy self-sufficient. Mass and energy balances needed for the study were performed using Aspen Plus 8.4, and the environmental assessment was carried out through SimaPro 8.0. CML 2000 was selected as the life cycle impact assessment method, considering as impact categories the global warming, ozone layer depletion, abiotic depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, eutrophication, acidification, and cumulative energy demand. A distinction between biogenic and fossil CO2 emissions was done to quantify a more realistic GHG inventory of 3.77 kg CO2-eq per kg H2 produced. Additionally, the environmental profile of SCWR process was compared to other H2 production technologies such as steam methane reforming, carbon gasification, water electrolysis and dark fermentation among others. This way, it is shown that SCWR of glycerol allows reducing greenhouse gas emissions and obtaining a favorable positive life cycle energy balance, achieving a good environmental performance of H2 and power production by SCWR of glycerol. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We tested the extent to which proportional ecosystem representation targets would be maintained under a changing climate by projecting the distribution of the major ecosystems of Alberta, Canada, into the future using bioclimatic envelope models and then calculating the composition of reserves in successive periods. We used the Marxan conservation planning software to generate the suite of reserve systems for our test, varying the representation target and degree of reserve clumping. Our climate envelope projections for the 2080s indicate that virtually all reserves will, in time, be comprised of different ecosystem types than today. Nevertheless, our proportional targets for ecosystem representation were maintained across all time periods, with only minor exceptions. We hypothesize that this stability in representation arises because ecosystems may be serving as proxies for land facets, the stable abiotic landscape features that delineate major arenas of biological activity. The implication is that accommodating climate change may not require abandoning the conventional ecosystem-based approach to reserve design in favour of a strictly abiotic approach, since the two approaches may be largely synonymous. © 2015 Schneider, Bayne.",,"Margules, C., Pressey, R., Systematic conservation planning (2000) Nature., 405, pp. 243-253. , 10821285; Watson, J., Grantham, H., Wilson, K., Possingham, H., Systematic conservation planning: Past present and future (2011) Conservation Biogeography, pp. 136-160. , In: Ladle R Whittaker R editors.

The offset of water head from the design considerations of water pumping systems has increased energy requirements leading to worsening of the situation with respect to availability of energy and water. Consequently, highly capitalized water supply schemes, which have been designed to meet the demand, are underutilized leading to operational inefficiencies. Robust empirical equations can help detect inefficiencies in water pumping systems, and this paper discusses the equations which were developed by analysing data obtained from various water supply utilities facing water scarcity. These equations provide cost-benefit analysis for decision making in water utilities and can bring about energy efficiency in municipal pumping operations. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Climate change mitigation; Cost-benefit analysis; Energy efficiency; Urban water supply; Water scarcity",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929427956

The results show that aggregate global HCFC emissions did not increase appreciably during 2007-2012 and suggest that the 2007 Adjustments to the Montreal Protocol played a role in limiting HCFC emissions well in advance of the 2013 cap on global production. HCFC emissions varied between 27 and 29 kt CFC-11-equivalent (eq)/y or 0.76 and 0.79 GtCO<inf>2</inf>-eq/y during this period. Despite slower than projected increases in aggregate HCFC emissions since 2007, total emissions of HFCs used as substitutes for HCFCs and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have not increased more rapidly than rates projected [Velders, G.

U.S.A. 2009, 106, 10949-10954] for 2007-2012. HFC global emission magnitudes related to this substitution totaled 0.51 (-0.03, +0.04) GtCO<inf>2</inf>-eq/y in 2012, a magnitude about two times larger than emissions reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for these HFCs. Assuming accurate reporting to the UNFCCC, the results imply that developing countries (non-Annex I Parties) not reporting to the UNFCCC now account for nearly 50% of global HFC emissions used as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). Global HFC emissions (as CO<inf>2</inf>-eq) from ODS substitution can be attributed approximately equally to mobile air conditioning, commercial refrigeration, and the sum of all other applications. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Velders, G.J.M., Fahey, D.W., Daniel, J.S., Mcfarland, M., Andersen, S.O., The Large Contribution of Projected HFC Emissions to Future Climate Forcing (2009) Proc.

However, rice cultivation contributes to global warming through greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Technologies for reducing GHG emissions in concert with the increased rice production from rice fields are needed. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of steel slag applications on methane (CH<inf>4</inf>) and nitrous oxide (N<inf>2</inf>O) emissions and rice yields. Two study sites were established at the experimental farm belonging to Indonesian Agricultural Environment Research Institute (IAERI) in Jakenan and a farmer’s field in Wedarijaksa sub-district, Indonesia. Both field trials were conducted during the dry season (DS) of 2009 and the rainy season (RS) of 2009/2010. During the DS, a randomized block design was arranged with two treatments (a control and a steel slag application at 1 Mg ha−1), which were replicated five times. During the RS, the experimental plot with 1 Mg ha−1 of steel slag treatment was split into two small sub-plots to accommodate the additional 1 and 2 Mg ha−1 steel slag treatments. The results showed that there was a decreasing tendency in the CH<inf>4</inf> emissions at both sites and during both seasons after steel slag applications, although there was no statistical significance. During the RS in Jakenan, steel slag applications at rates of 1 and 2 Mg ha−1 decreased the CH<inf>4</inf> emissions by 9.1 and 10.7%, respectively. In Wedarijaksa, steel slag applications at rates of 1 and 2 Mg ha−1 decreased the CH<inf>4</inf> emissions by 12.6 to 18.7%, respectively. The N<inf>2</inf>O emissions were decreased by 34 and 38% following slag applications at the 2 Mg ha−1 rate during the RS in Jakenan and Wedarijaksa, respectively. The iron content of steel slag could be used to reduce not only CH<inf>4</inf> but also N<inf>2</inf>O emissions. Increased level of electron acceptors suppresses CH<inf>4</inf> and N<inf>2</inf>O emissions. The application of steel slag at 1 and 2 Mg ha−1 increased rice grain yields by approximately 4.8–5.6% in Jakenan and 0.3–4.7% in Wedarijaksa. It might be better to apply steel slag at higher rates for more than two growing seasons to reach reduction in CH<inf>4</inf> and N<inf>2</inf>O emissions. © 2015 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929233423

Long shoots bearing vegetative buds and short shoots bearing floral buds were regularly collected during two successive cycles at Marsillargues, France (2011/12, 2012/13) and Palmas, Paraná, Brazil (2012, 2013). The dormant state in vegetative buds was evaluated by the single-node cutting test and in floral buds by the Tabuenca’s test. The first approach highlighted important differences in the dormancy dynamics in both sites, clearly showing that: (1) the entry and the maximum level of dormancy are strongly correlated with cold winter temperatures; (2) the three classical phases of dormancy dynamics are difficult to differentiate under a mild winter climate; and (3) endodormancy, if it actually exists, is very weak and lasts only for a short time. Distinct temporal changes between both sites were found for flower primordia fresh and dry weight. The ecodormant state was linked to significant changes in dry weight and the capacity to quickly reach a water content of around 77 % according to the Tabuenca’s test. High temperatures in Brazil allowed a quick transition between endodormancy and ecodormancy compared to France where the rehydration period was long. The weak endodormancy associated with a quasi-absence of ecodormancy could explain the strong spatio-temporal heterogeneity of budburst and flowering under a mild winter climate. This may be useful for understanding the future phenology of trees under global warming conditions and for the selection of adapted cultivars. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Dormancy release; Ecodormancy; Endodormancy; Floral primordia; Vegetative buds; Water content",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929192273

The analyses are performed on data with the 5-year running means removed to reduce the potential effects of slowly-varying external driving factors, such as global warming. We show that positive (negative) Barents–Kara sea ice concentration anomaly in autumn is associated with a positive (negative) North Atlantic Oscillation-like (NAO) pattern with lags of up to 3 months. The month-to-month variations in the lag relationships of the atmospheric anomalies related to November sea ice concentration are presented. Further analysis shows that the stratosphere-troposphere interaction may provide the memory in the system: positive (negative) sea ice concentration anomaly in November is associated with a strengthened (weakened) stratospheric polar vortex and these anomalies propagate downward leading to the positive (negative) NAO-like pattern in the late December to early January. This stratosphere mechanism may also play a role for Barents–Kara sea ice anomaly in December, but not for September and October. Consistently, Eliassen-Palm, eddy heat and momentum fluxes suggest that there is strong forcing of the zonal winds in November. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Climate impact of Arctic sea ice; North Atlantic Oscillation; Sea ice-atmosphere interaction; Stratosphere downward propagation",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929439717

Empirical studies in diverse mountain ranges, however, give evidence of both advancing alpine treelines and rather insignificant responses. The inconsistency of findings suggests distinct differences in the sensitivity of global treelines to recent climate change. It is still unclear where Himalayan treeline ecotones are located along the response gradient from rapid dynamics to apparently complete inertia. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge regarding sensitivity and response of Himalayan treelines to climate warming, based on extensive field observations, published results in the widely scattered literature, and novel data from ongoing research of the present authors. <br><br> Several sensitivity indicators such as treeline type, treeline form, seed-based regeneration, and growth patterns are evaluated. Since most Himalayan treelines are anthropogenically depressed, observed advances are largely the result of land use change. Near-natural treelines are usually krummholz treelines, which are relatively unresponsive to climate change. Nevertheless, intense recruitment of treeline trees suggests a great potential for future treeline advance. Competitive abilities of seedlings within krummholz thickets and dwarf scrub heaths will be a major source of variation in treeline dynamics. Tree growth-climate relationships show mature treeline trees to be responsive to temperature change, in particular in winter and pre-monsoon seasons. High pre-monsoon temperature trends will most likely drive tree growth performance in the western and central Himalaya. Ecological niche modelling suggests that bioclimatic conditions for a range expansion of treeline trees will be created during coming decades. © Author(s) 2015.",,"Akatov, P.V., Changes in the upper limits of tree species distribution in the western Caucasus (Belaya River basin) related to recent climate warming (2009) Russ.

Air conditioning growth is expected to be particularly strong in middleincome countries, but direct empirical evidence is scarce. In this paper we use high-quality microdata from Mexico to describe the relationship between temperature, income, and air conditioning. We describe both how electricity consumption increases with temperature given current levels of air conditioning, and how climate and income drive air conditioning adoption decisions. We then combine these estimates with predicted end-of-century temperature changes to forecast future energy consumption. Under conservative assumptions about household income, our model predicts near-universal saturation of air conditioning in all warm areas within just a few decades. Temperature increases contribute to this surge in adoption, but income growth by itself explains most of the increase. What this will mean for electricity consumption and carbon dioxide emissions depends on the pace of technological change. Continued advances in energy efficiency or the development of new cooling technologies could reduce the energy consumption impacts. Similarly, growth in low-carbon electricity generation could mitigate the increases in carbon dioxide emissions. However, the paper illustrates the enormous potential impacts in this sector, highlighting the importance of future research on adaptation and underscoring the urgent need for global action on climate change.","Adaptation; Air conditioning; Climate change; Energy demand; Energy efficiency","US Department of Energy, (2014) Residential Energy Consumption Survey, , www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/; Euromonitor International, (2014) Air Treatment Products in China, , Euromonitor International, Shanghai, China; Sivak, M., Will air conditioning put a chill on the global energy supply?

We find that the total CO<inf>2</inf>-equivalent emissions of the five HFCs from countries that are required to provide detailed, annual reports to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) increased from 198 (175-221) Tg-CO<inf>2</inf>-eq·y-1 in 2007 to 275 (246-304) Tg-CO<inf>2</inf>-eq·y-1 in 2012. These global warming potential-weighted aggregated emissions agree well with those reported to the UNFCCC throughout this period and indicate that the gap between reported emissions and global HFC emissions derived from atmospheric trends is almost entirely due to emissions from nonreporting countries. However, our measurement-based estimates of individual HFC species suggest that emissions, from reporting countries, of the most abundant HFC, HFC-134a, were only 79% (63-95%) of the UNFCCC inventory total, while other HFC emissions were significantly greater than the reported values. These results suggest that there are inaccuracies in the reporting methods for individual HFCs, which appear to cancel when aggregated together. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

Møllers Allé 8, Aarhus C, Denmark","A large amount of organic carbon is stored in high-latitude soils. A substantial proportion of this carbon stock is vulnerable and may decompose rapidly due to temperature increases that are already greater than the global average. It is therefore crucial to quantify and understand carbon exchange between the atmosphere and subarctic/arctic ecosystems. In this paper, we combine an Arctic-enabled version of the process-based dynamic ecosystem model, LPJ-GUESS (version LPJG-WHyMe-TFM) with comprehensive observations of terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes to simulate long-term carbon exchange in a subarctic catchment at 50 m resolution. Integrating the observed carbon fluxes from aquatic systems with the modeled terrestrial carbon fluxes across the whole catchment, we estimate that the area is a carbon sink at present and will become an even stronger carbon sink by 2080, which is mainly a result of a projected densification of birch forest and its encroachment into tundra heath. However, the magnitudes of the modeled sinks are very dependent on future atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, comparisons of global warming potentials between two simulations with and without CO2 increase since 1960 reveal that the increased methane emission from the peatland could double the warming effects of the whole catchment by 2080 in the absence of CO2 fertilization of the vegetation. This is the first process-based model study of the temporal evolution of a catchment-level carbon budget at high spatial resolution, including both terrestrial and aquatic carbon. Though this study also highlights some limitations in modeling subarctic ecosystem responses to climate change, such as aquatic system flux dynamics, nutrient limitation, herbivory and other disturbances, and peatland expansion, our study provides one process-based approach to resolve the complexity of carbon cycling in subarctic ecosystems while simultaneously pointing out the key model developments for capturing complex subarctic processes. © Author(s) 2015.",,"Åkerman, H.J., Johansson, M., Thawing permafrost and thicker active layers in sub-arctic Sweden (2008) Permafrost Periglac., 19, pp. 279-292; AMAP, (2012) Arctic Climate Issues 2011: Changes in Arctic Snow, 3p. , Water, Ice and Permafrost, Oslo; Arneth, A., Niinemets Ü., Pressley, S., Bäck, J., Hari, P., Karl, T., Noe, S., Smith, B., Process-based estimates of terrestrial ecosystem isoprene emissions: Incorporating the effects of a direct CO<inf>2</inf>-isoprene interaction (2007) Atmos.

The results indicate that the following. (1) For the regional average trends of precipitation, nine indices [i.e., RR, SDII, PCI(day), R25mm, R50mm, R25mmT, R50mmT, R25mmTOT, and R50mmTOT] show the increasing trends, while three indices [i.e., RX1day, RR1 and PCI(month)] display the decreasing trends. Furthermore, the annual total precipitation (RR) is correlated strongly with most of the other precipitation indices, especially indices represent the heavy precipitation which is responsible for more than 90 % of the total increase of precipitation. (2) The central and southern parts of the study area become more humid than the northern parts, although the daily precipitation undergo a consistent concentrated trend over almost all of the study area. Moreover, the frequency and contribution of the heavy precipitation also arise dramatically in almost the entire study area, and the precipitation events show the significant trend of extremeness. (3) The abrupt changes for RR, RX1day, SDII, R50mm, R50mmT, and R50mmTOT are detected in 1984, 1988, 1987, 1984, 1988, and 1988, respectively, which indicate the abrupt change of precipitation occurred consistently in the mid-1980s. Three major cycles of precipitation detected are 5–6-year cycle, 13-year cycle, and 20-year cycle, with a nonsignificant 2-year cycle coexisted. In addition, a significant change of cycles occurred in the 1980s, when the short cycle was set to overtake the long cycle, resulting in high-frequency and instability of precipitation changes over the YRD region in recent decades. (4) There are three factors (the global warming, the East Asian summer monsoon change, and the urbanization development) might potentially impact on the frequency and volume of precipitation. The variation of East Asian summer monsoon is the key factor that influences the increase of precipitation, while the global warming and the urbanization development perform the background factor and the local factor, respectively. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Wien",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929208838

New opportunities arise in the investigation of potential effects of a warmer world on meteorological and hydrological extremes at regional scales. In this work, an ensemble of EURO-CORDEX RCP8.5 scenarios is used to drive a distributed hydrological model and assess the projected changes in flood hazard in Europe through the current century. Changes in magnitude and frequency of extreme streamflow events are investigated by statistical distribution fitting and peak over threshold analysis. A consistent method is proposed to evaluate the agreement of ensemble projections. Results indicate that the change in frequency of discharge extremes is likely to have a larger impact on the overall flood hazard as compared to the change in their magnitude. On average, in Europe, flood peaks with return periods above 100 years are projected to double in frequency within 3 decades. © Author(s) 2015.",,"Alfieri, L., Thielen, J., Pappenberger, F., Ensemble hydrometeorological simulation for flash flood early detection in southern Switzerland (2012) J.

How changing quality of fresh organic matter (FOM) might influence the priming effect (PE) on soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization is still under debate. Here we determined the PE induced by two 13 C-labeled FOMs with contrasting nutritional quality (leaf vs. stalk of Zea mays L.). Soils from two different forest types yielded consistent results: soils amended with leaf tissue switched faster from negative PE to positive PE due to greater microbial growth compared to soils amended with stalks. However, after 16 d of incubation, soils amended with stalks had a higher PE than those amended with leaf. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) results suggested that microbial demand for carbon and other nutrients was one of the major determinants of the PE observed. Therefore, consideration of both microbial demands for nutrients and FOM supply simultaneously is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms of PE. Our study provided evidence that changes in FOM quality could affect microbial utilization of substrate and PE on SOM mineralization, which may exacerbate global warming problems under future climate change.",,"García-Palacios, P., Maestre, F.T., Bardgett, R.D., De Kroon, H., Plant responses to soil heterogeneity and global environmental change (2012) J.

This study assessed a potential northward shift in the overwintering boundaries and changes in the overwintering areas and voltinism of this planthopper species in China in response to global warming. Temperature data generated by 15 Global Circulation Models (GCMs) from 2010 to 2099 were employed to analyze the planthopper’s overwintering boundaries and overwintering areas in conjunction with three Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). Planthopper voltinism from 1961 to 2050 was analyzed in scenario A2 using degree-day models with projections from the regional circulation model (RCM) Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS). In both analyses, 1961–1990 served as the baseline period. Both the intermittent and constant overwintering boundaries were projected to shift northward; these shifts were more pronounced during later time periods and in scenarios A2 and A1B. The intermittent overwintering area was modeled to increase by 11, 24 and 44 %, and the constant overwintering area, by 66, 206 and 477 %, during the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively. Planthopper voltinism will increase by <0.5, 0.5–1.0 and 1.0–1.4 generations in northern, central and southern China, respectively, in 2021–2050. Our results suggest that the brown planthopper will overwinter in a much larger region and will produce more generations under future climate warming scenarios. As a result, the planthopper will exert an even greater threat to China’s rice production in the future. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929103720

Understanding the genetic mechanism of heat tolerance and developing heat-tolerant varieties is essential to cope with future global warming. Previously, we reported on a QTL (qHTSF4.1) from an IR64/N22 population responsible for rice spikelet fertility under high-temperature stress at the flowering stage. To further fine map and validate the effect of qHTSF4.1, PCR-based SNP markers were developed and used to genotype BC<inf>2</inf>F<inf>2</inf>, BC<inf>3</inf>F<inf>2</inf>, BC<inf>3</inf>F<inf>3</inf>, and BC<inf>5</inf>F<inf>2</inf> populations from the same cross. The interval of the QTL was narrowed down to about 1.2 Mb; however, further recombination was not identified even with a large BC<inf>5</inf>F<inf>2</inf> population that was subsequently developed and screened. The sequence in the QTL region is highly conserved and a large number of genes in the same gene family were observed to be clustered in the region. The QTL qHTSF4.1 consistently increased spikelet fertility in all of the backcross populations. This was confirmed using 24 rice varieties. Most of the rice varieties with the QTL showed a certain degree of heat tolerance under high-temperature conditions. In a BC<inf>5</inf>F<inf>2</inf> population with clean background of IR64, QTL qHTSF4.1 increased spikelet fertility by about 15 %. It could be an important source for enhancing heat tolerance in rice at the flowering stage. PCR-based SNP markers developed in this study can be used for QTL introgression and for pyramiding with other agronomically important QTLs/genes through marker-assisted selection. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929096155

Whether present wind trends support this hypothesis remains controversial, as results of previous studies seem to depend on the study area, the length of the time series, the season, and even the database used. In this study, temporal and spatial trends in the coastal upwelling regime worldwide were investigated during upwelling seasons from 1982 to 2010 using a single wind database (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis) with high spatial resolution (0.3°). Of the major upwelling systems, increasing trends were only observed in the coastal areas of Benguela, Peru, Canary, and northern California. A tendency for an increase in upwelling-favourable winds was also identified along several less studied regions, such as the western Australian and southern Caribbean coasts.",,"Bakun, A., Global climate change and intensification of coastal upwelling (1990) Science, 247, pp. 198-201; Barton, E.D., Field, D.B., Roy, C., Canary current upwelling: More or less?

However, two opposing views have been presented in this research area: global NPP increases with global warming, and global NPP decreases with global warming. The main reasons for these two opposite results are the tremendous differences among seasonal and annual climate variables, and the growth of plants in accordance with these climate variables. Therefore, it will fail to fully clarify the relation between vegetation growth and climate changes by research that relies solely on annual data. With seasonal climate variables, we may clarify the relation between vegetation growth and climate changes more accurately. Our research examined the arid and semiarid areas in China (ASAC), which account for one quarter of the total area of China. The ecological environment of these areas is fragile and easily affected by human activities. We analyzed the influence of climate changes, especially the changes in seasonal climate variables, on NPP, with Climatic Research Unit (CRU) climatic data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite remote data, for the years 2000–2010. The results indicate that: for annual climatic data, the percentage of the ASAC in which NPP is positively correlated with temperature is 66.11%, and 91.47% of the ASAC demonstrates a positive correlation between NPP and precipitation. Precipitation is more positively correlated with NPP than temperature in the ASAC. For seasonal climatic data, the correlation between NPP and spring temperature shows significant regional differences. Positive correlation areas are concentrated in the eastern portion of the ASAC, while the western section of the ASAC generally shows a negative correlation. However, in summer, most areas in the ASAC show a negative correlation between NPP and temperature. In autumn, precipitation is less important in the west, as opposed to the east, in which it is critically important. Temperatures in winter are a limiting factor for NPP throughout the region. The findings of this research not only underline the importance of seasonal climate variables for vegetation growth, but also suggest that the effects of seasonal climate variables on NPP should be explored further in related research in the future. © 2015 Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agricultural Ecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","annual/seasonal variability; arid/semiarid regions of China (ASAC); climate change; net primary productivity (NPP); trend analysis",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929093590

The study covers all relevant life cycle stages, from raw material production to compressor use and final disposal. The research is conducted in accordance with ISO 14040/14044 standards. Methods: Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is applied in this study, and Chinese Life Cycle Database is used for the assessment. The evaluation results are presented in terms of individual impact category according to the characterization model (CML 2001) and normalization references (Laurent et al. 16:401–409, 2011). The following seven impact categories are considered: global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, photochemical ozone formation potential, ozone depletion potential, ecotoxicity, and primary energy demand. All necessary energy and material flows are detailed for assessment purposes. Results and discussion: LCA results show that the compressor use stage in the life cycle consumes the most energy and exerts the strongest environmental impact, followed by the stages of raw material production and component manufacturing. Meanwhile, primary energy demand, ecotoxicity, and global warming potential are three predominant impact categories along with the entire life cycle of the refrigeration compressor; which account for 36.2150, 34.4567, and 16.5862 % of total impacts, respectively. Conclusions: Results show that the compressor use stage may be improved given that environmental impact is largely influenced by electricity requirement. Further investigation must be conducted to improve compressor service efficiency. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Acidification potential; Ecotoxicity; Energy consumption; Environmental emission; Eutrophication potential; Global warming potential; Life cycle assessment; Ozone depletion potential; Photochemical ozone formation potential; Primary energy demand; Refrigeration compressor",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928975505

Comparing observed surface temperature trends against the simulated ones by the CMIP5 historical experiments especially in the zonal mean context suggests that although the anthropogenic greenhouse-gases (GHG) forcing has played a major role, in addition to the anthropogenic aerosols and various natural forcings, the effects from decadal-to-interdecadal-scale internal modes specifically the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are also very strong. Evident temperature changes associated with the PDO’s phase shift are seen in the Pacific basin, with decadal-scale cooling in the tropical central-eastern Pacific and most of the east basin and concurrent warming in the subtropics of both hemispheres, even though the PDO’s net effect on global mean temperature is relatively weak. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) also changed its phase in the mid-1990s, and hence its possible impact is estimated and assessed as well. However, comparisons with CMIP5 simulations suggest that the AMO may have not contributed as significantly as the PDO in terms of the changes/trends in global surface temperature, even though the data analysis technique used here suggests otherwise. Long-term precipitation changes or trends during the post-1979 period are further shown to have been modulated by the two major factors: anthropogenic GHG and PDO, in addition to the relatively weak effects from aerosols and natural forcings. The spatial patterns of observed precipitation trends in the Pacific, including reductions in the tropical central-eastern Pacific and increases in the tropical western Pacific and along the South Pacific Convergence Zone, manifest the PDO’s contributions. Removing the PDO effect from the total precipitation trends makes the spatial structures of precipitation trends more similar to those simulated by CMIP5 historical full forcing experiments particularly in the context of zonal-mean results. This also confirms that in spite of the PDO effect specifically on regional scales, the anthropogenic GHG signals are still discernible in observed precipitation during the time period. Following the increase of GHG, precipitation tends to increase roughly along the climatological ITCZ and decrease south of the equator and in the subtropics of both hemispheres. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; Global precipitation and temperature change/variability; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; The effect of anthropogenic greenhouse-gas related surface warming",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928958157

We applied factorial warming and nutrient manipulation to a nutrient and species poor alpine/arctic heath community for seven years. Vascular plant abundance in control plots increased by 31%. There were also notable changes in cover in the nutrient and combined nutrient and warming treatments, with deciduous and evergreen shrubs declining, grasses overgrowing these plots. Sedge abundance initially increased significantly with nutrient amendment and then declined, going below initial values in the combined nutrient and warming treatment. Nutrient addition resulted in a change in dominance hierarchy from deciduous shrubs to grasses. We found significant declines in vascular plant diversity and evenness in the warming treatment and a decline in diversity in the combined warming and nutrient addition treatment, while nutrient addition caused a decline in species richness. The results give some experimental support that species poor plant communities with low diversity may be more vulnerable to loss of species diversity than communities with higher initial diversity. The projected increase in nutrient deposition and warming may therefore have negative impacts on ecosystem processes, functioning and services due to loss of species diversity in an already impoverished environment.",,"Grandy, A.S., Sinsabaugh, R.L., Neff, J.C., Stursova, M., Zak, D.R., Nitrogen deposition effects on soil organic matter chemistry are linked to variation in enzymes, ecosystems and size fractions (2008) Biogeochemistry, 91, pp. 37-49; Clark, C.M., Morefield, P.E., Gilliam, F.S., Pardo, L.H., Estimated losses of plant biodiversity in the United States from historical N deposition 1985-2010 (2013) Ecology, 94, pp. 1441-1448; (2013) Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis.

The goal is to accelerate research, development, and demonstration of safe, scalable, and affordable low-emissions energy technologies. Such a commitment should be based on three elements. First, it should operate within existing UNFCCC negotiations so as to encourage developed states to offer directed funding for energy research as part of their national contributions. Second, pledges should be binding, verifiable, and coordinated within an international energy-research plan. Third, expert scientific networks and participating governments should collaborate to design a coordinated global research and technology-demonstration strategy and oversee national research efforts. To this end an Intergovernmental Panel on Low-Emissions Technology Research might be established. This proposal offers some insurance against the risk that the political impasse in international negotiations cannot be overcome. The higher costs associated with low-emissions alternatives to fossil fuels currently creates significant economic and political resistance to their widespread adoption. To breach this impasse, a mechanism supporting accelerated energy research is needed that seeks to reduce future abatement costs, share experience and ‘learning-by-doing’ in first-of-a-kind demonstrations, and thus facilitate future widespread deployments. These actions will also assist in addressing inequalities in energy access. Policy relevance Over the past decade, global fossil-fuel use and associated carbon emissions have risen steadily, despite the majority of nations agreeing, in principle, to work to limit global warming to less than 2 °C above pre-industrial conditions (IPCC, 2014). Accelerated research, development, and demonstration of low-emissions technologies will be required for successful and economically efficient decarbonization of the global economy, but how can the current deadlock be broken? The UNFCCC does not contain adequate mechanisms to promote increased investment in research, so climate-governance institutions are not capturing the gains that could be achieved through a globally coordinated approach. Here, we outline reform proposals that would enhance both the economic effectiveness of global abatement efforts and the political feasibility of accelerated innovation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","induced technological change; innovation policy; multilateral climate policy frameworks; research policy",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929252758

This point was extensively discussed for three-component mixtures. Moving to quaternary mixtures the complexity of the Petlyuk configuration represents the main barrier of its possible implementation in the industrial practice. In the present work, a set of new alternative distillation configurations to the four-component Petlyuk is presented. A hydrocarbon and an alcohol mixture are considered to prove their applicability. The total annual cost, together with the thermodynamic efficiency and the carbon dioxide emissions, are considered as comparison index between the Petlyuk and the alternative configurations. The results obtained proved that for the cases considered at least one of the alternative configurations showed a better or at least the same performance of the Petlyuk arrangement.

Future climate warming will likely increase the frequency of fire-triggering drought, so that the future terrestrial carbon uptake will depend on how fires respond to altered climate variation. In this study, we modelled the role of fires in the global terrestrial carbon balance for 1901-2012, using the ORCHIDEE global vegetation model equipped with the SPITFIRE model. We conducted two simulations with and without the fire module being activated, using a static land cover. The simulated global fire carbon emissions for 1997-2009 are 2.1 Pg C yr-1, which is close to the 2.0 Pg C yr-1 as estimated by GFED3.1. The simulated land carbon uptake after accounting for emissions for 2003-2012 is 3.1 Pg C yr-1, which is within the uncertainty of the residual carbon sink estimation (2:8±0:8 Pg C yr-1). Fires are found to reduce the terrestrial carbon uptake by 0.32 Pg C yr-1 over 1901-2012, or 20% of the total carbon sink in a world without fire. The fire-induced land sink reduction (SR<inf>fire</inf>) is significantly correlated with climate variability, with larger sink reduction occurring in warm and dry years, in particular during El Niño events. Our results suggest a ""fire respiration partial compensation"". During the 10 lowest SR<inf>fire</inf> years (SR<inf>fire</inf> D 0:17 Pg C yr-1), fires mainly compensate for the heterotrophic respiration that would occur in a world without fire. By contrast, during the 10 highest SR<inf>fire</inf> fire years (SR<inf>fire</inf> D 0:49 Pg C yr-1), fire emissions far exceed their respiration partial compensation and create a larger reduction in terrestrial carbon uptake. Our findings have important implications for the future role of fires in the terrestrial carbon balance, because the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to sequester carbon will be diminished by future climate change characterized by increased frequency of droughts and extreme El Niño events. © Author(s) 2015.

One such technology employs a floating, solid-walled enclosure as the primary culture environment, providing greater potential control over negative interactions with surroundings waters while limiting energy use required for water circulation, thermo-regulation and supplemental oxygen provision. Here, we utilize life cycle assessment to model contributions to a suite of global-scale resource depletion and environmental concerns (including global warming potential, acidification potential, marine eutrophication potential, cumulative energy use, and biotic resource use) of such a technology deployed commercially to rear Chinook salmon in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Results indicate that at full grow-out, feed provisioning and on-site energy use dominate contributions across four of five impact categories assessed. For example, per tonne of salmon harvested, feed contributed approximately 72% to global warming potential, 72% to acidification potential, and accounted for 100% of biotic resource use. However, for both feed and on-site energy use, impacts are heavily influenced by specific sources of inputs; therefore efforts to improve the environmental performance of this technology should focus on reducing these in favor of less impactful alternatives. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"(2012) The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture, p. 209. , FAO: Rome; De Silva, S.S., Aquaculture: A newly emergent food production sector-and perspectives of its impacts on biodiversity and conservation (2012) Biodiversity Conserv., 21, pp. 3187-3220; Henriksson, P.J.G., Guinée, J.B., Kleijn, R., De Snoo, G.R., Life cycle assessment of aquaculture systems-A review of methodologies (2011) Int.

A basic natural gas CCHP system containing power generation unit, heat recovery system, hybrid cooling system and storage tank, is integrated with solar photovoltaic (PV) and/or heat collector. LCA optimization methodology is proposed to optimize the configuration and variable load operation of the solar-assisted CCHP system to minimize the life cycle environmental impact. CCHP schemes in following electrical load (FEL) and following thermal load (FTL) strategies are optimized by different objectives respectively. Analysis and comparison are performed on life cycle environmental impacts caused by global warming potential, acidification potential and respiratory effect potential. The influences of main independent decision variables are discussed to discover the generic configuration rules for hybrid CCHP system. The results indicate that FTL strategy is superior to FEL strategy at taking the environmental compensation of surplus products from the hybrid CCHP system into consideration. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) system;

The increase in water deficit near 2000 coincides with a substantial increase in NH temperature and PET. The most pronounced increases in deficit occurred for the latitudinal band from 0 to 40°N. These results indicate that global warming has increased the water deficit in the NH and that the increase since 2000 is unprecedented for the 1905 through 2009 period. Additionally, coincident with the increase in deficit near 2000, mean NH runoff also increased due to increases in P.

This shortfall gives rise to concerns because incorrect AIS estimates impact significantly on our ability to predict sea-level change in the course of global warming. Given the scarcity of geological data and the complexity of the Antarctic response to glacio-isostatic adjustment processes, there is a need for accurate data to constrain the timing of the ice-sheet retreat. Here, we provide such data on the Holocene Antarctic melting through an isolated geographic site on the northern hemisphere, which we show is sensitive to the Antarctic signal. Using both our site, and other mid-latitudinal relative sea-level sites, our model provides a consensus estimate that the AIS released water corresponding to 5m equivalent sea level at 8ka and ceased melting at 6ka. This is different to most AIS models, which release an equal amount of water at 11ka or after 6ka. Our findings change model assumptions about the terminal AIS melting and show that future Holocene sea-level research should focus on broad shelves and large coast embayments in the mid latitudes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Antarctic; Continental levering; Holocene; Sea-level highstand","Angulo, R.J., Lessa, G.C., de Souza, M.C., A critical review of mid- to late-Holocene sea-level fluctuations on the eastern Brazilian coastline (2006) Quat.

In this context, Ground-Coupled Heat Pumps (GCHP) have proved to be the most efficient heating and cooling system. The main parameters to define a ground heat exchanger are obtained via an in situ test called Thermal Response Test (TRT). However, ambient air influence on this test is remarkable due to the exposition of the testing machine, and even the ground undisturbed temperature varies with the ambient temperature oscillations. Therefore, despite the fact that the influence of ambient conditions on the TRT results is an important topic in order to define a ground heat exchanger, there is yet a limited literature on new theoretical methods to correct the ambient temperature influence on the predicted ground thermal conductivity measured via TRT. This paper presents a new methodology to analyse and mitigate the influence of the ambient conditions on the TRT results, with the main advantage that it is not necessary to know its physical origin previously. The method is focused on reducing the mean fluid temperature oscillations caused by the ambient temperature, by analysing the influence of the chosen time interval to fit the data to the infinite line source theory formulae that finally predicts the ground thermal conductivity. With these purpose, results of two different TRTs were analysed, each of them with a different equipment and ambient exposition. Results using the proposed method showed that thermal conductivity oscillations were reduced in both tests. For the first test, the uncertainty associated to the chosen time interval for the estimation was diminished by 33%, reducing significantly its predicted value and thus avoiding the future installation possible under-designing. However, because of the equipment insulation improvements and the smoother ambient temperature variations, the method obtained similar results for the predicted thermal conductivity and for its uncertainty for the second test. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Energy efficiency; Temperature influence; Thermal conductivity; Thermal response test","Omer, A.M., Energy, environment and sustainable development (2008) Renew.

Additionally, we assessed the changes in DO stratification over the past 61 years (1953-2013) based on our empirical models and long-term air temperature and transparency data. The DO concentration never fell below 2mg/L, the critical value for anoxia, and the DO depth profiles were closely linked to the water temperature depth profiles. In the stable stratification period in summer and autumn, the significant increase in CDOM in the metalimnion explained the decrease in DO due to the oxygen consumed by CDOM. Well-developed oxygen stratification was detected at the three sites in spring, summer and autumn and was associated with thermal stratification. Oxycline depth was significantly negatively correlated with daily air temperature and thermocline thickness but significantly positively correlated with thermocline depth during the stratification weakness period (July-February). However, there were no significant correlations among these parameters during the stratification formation period (March-June). The increase of 1.67°C in yearly average daily air temperature between 1980 and 2013 and the decrease of 0.78m in Secchi disk depth caused a decrease of 1.65m and 2.78m in oxycline depth, respectively, facilitating oxygen stratification and decreasing water quality. Therefore, climate warming has had a substantial effect on water quality through changing the DO regime in Lake Qiandaohu. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Dissolved oxygen; Oxycline depth; Stratification; Thermocline depth","Arend, K.K., Beletsky, D., Depinto, J.V., Ludsin, S.A., Roberts, J.J., Rucinski, D.K., Scavia, D., Höök, T.O., Seasonal and interannual effects of hypoxia on fish habitat quality in central Lake Erie (2011) Freshw.

However, many underpopulated deltas harbouring high biological and cultural diversity are also at risk but will most likely continue to be ignored as conservation targets. In this study, we explore the potential effects of erosion, inundation and salinisation on one of the world's comparatively underpopulated megadeltas, the Orinoco Delta. With a 1. m sea level rise expected to occur by 2100, several models predict a moderate erosion of the delta's shorelines, migration or loss of mangroves, general inundation of the delta with an accompanying submersion of wetlands, and an increase in the distance to which sea water intrudes into streams, resulting in harm to the freshwater biota and resources. The Warao people are the indigenous inhabitants of the Orinoco Delta and currently are subject to various socioeconomic stressors. Changes due to sea level rise will occur extremely rapidly and cause abrupt shifts in the Warao's traditional environments and resources, resulting in migrations and abandonment of their ancestral territories. However, evidence indicates that deltaic aggradation/accretion processes at the Orinoco delta due to allochthonous sediment input and vegetation growth could be elevating the surface of the land, keeping pace with the local sea level rise. Other underpopulated and large deltas of the world also may risk immeasurable biodiversity and cultural losses and should not be forgotten as important conservation targets. © 2015.","Biodiversity; Climate change; Coastal flooding; Global warming; Hydrochemistry; Indigenous cultures; Large deltas; Neotropic; Wetland","Abell, R., Freshwater ecoregions of the world: a new map of biogeographic units for freshwater biodiversity conservation (2008) Bioscience, 58, pp. 403-414. , http:http://www.feow.org, Accessed July 2014); Barnosky, A.D., Nicholas Matzke, N., Tomiya, S., Wogan, O.U., Swartz, B., Quental, T.B., Has the earth's sixth mass extinction already arrived?

Approximately one fourth of the straw is burned on the field, which is a common practice in intensive rice cultivation systems in this region because there is limited time to prepare the field for the next crop. The spread of intensive rice production in the Delta may increase the total biomass of burning crop residues, significantly impacting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Vietnam. In this study, GHG emissions from the major uses of straw (burning and mushroom beds) were monitored in a triple rice cropping system located in the central Mekong Delta. Between September 2011 and November 2012, both wind tunnel and closed chamber methods were used to measure the emissions of major GHGs from straw-burning and straw-mushroom cultivation systems, respectively. The global warming potential (GWP) was then determined. Methane (CH<inf>4</inf>) and non-methane volatile organic carbon emissions (NMVOC) increased with lower modified combustion efficiency [MCE: emissions ratio of Carbon composing carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>-C) and carbon monooxide (CO-C) (CO<inf>2</inf>-C/(CO-C + CO<inf>2</inf>-C))]. Furthermore, higher moisture straw stacks generated lower nitrous oxide (N<inf>2</inf>O) emissions. Small straw stacks (5 or 10 kg dry straw) with higher moisture content emitted more carbon monoxide (CO), CH<inf>4</inf> and NMVOC. These results suggest that factors that increase the straw moisture content, such as rainfall, can cause smoldering combustion in small straw stacks or when straw is scattered on the ground, thereby inhibiting N<inf>2</inf>O emissions but enhancing CO, CH<inf>4</inf> and NMVOC. The measured N<inf>2</inf>O emissions contributed negligible amounts to the GWP compared with measured CO and CH<inf>4</inf>, which are relatively intense GHG emissions; this was likely a result of the slow and inefficient burning that was observed from the smaller straw stacks with higher moisture content. In this study, rice straw burning threatened to generate more GHGs than straw-mushroom (Volvariella volvacea (Bul. ex Fr.) Singer) cultivation under the studied agroecosystems. © 2015 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929000817

These rankings represent a considerable improvement on any individual publisher ranking, displaying an overall good consensus for the best and worst vintage years. Climate variables are calculated and weather type frequencies are matched between the eight highest and the eight lowest ranked vintages in the main phenological phases of Sangiovese grapevine. Results show that higher heat units; mean, maximum and minimum temperature; and more days with temperature above 35 °C were the most important discriminators between good- and poor-quality vintages in the spring and summer growth phases, with heat units important during ripening. Precipitation influences on vintage quality are significant only during veraison where low precipitation amounts and precipitation days are important for better quality vintages. In agreement with these findings, weather type analysis shows good vintages are favoured by weather type 4 (more anticyclones over central Mediterranean Europe (CME)), giving warm dry growing season conditions. Poor vintages all relate to higher frequencies of either weather type 3, which, by producing perturbation crossing CME, favours cooler and wetter conditions, and/or weather type 7 which favours cold dry continental air masses from the east and north east over CME. This approach shows there are important weather type frequency differences between good- and poor-quality vintages. Trend analysis shows that changes in weather type frequencies are more important than any due to global warming. © 2015 ISB","Climate; Climate variability; Consensus rankings; Grape phenology; Viticulture; Weather types",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929105144

Alternative cropping systems have been proposed to substitute for the conventional winter wheat-summer maize rotation system for the sustainable use of groundwater in the future. However, the impact of these cropping systems on net global warming potential (net GWP), and greenhouse gas emissions on the basis of per unit of yield (greenhouse gas intensity, GHGI) is poorly documented. Measurements of greenhouse gases were conducted over a four-year period to gain insight into net GWP and GHGI on a crop rotation scale based on an ongoing long-term field experiment on the North China Plain. The cropping systems investigated include one conventional winter wheat-summer maize system (Chem. W/M) as the control and four alternative cropping systems, namely an optimized winter wheat-summer maize system (Opt. W/M), two winter wheat-summer maize (or soybean)-spring maize system with three crops in two years (W/M-M, W/S-M), and a single spring maize per year (M). Compared with the Chem. W/M control, the grain yields in Opt. W/M increased significantly by 19% while the net GWP, GHGI and fertilizer N decreased by 29%, 40% and 40%, respectively, but still consumed as much groundwater (264mmyr-1) as Chem. W/M. In the two-year rotation cycle fertilizer N, groundwater use, net GWP and GHGI in W/M-M, W/S-M and M declined by 56-70%, 43-63%, 50-58% and 30-50%, respectively, compared to Chem. W/M. Moreover, these cropping systems consumed only 108-159mmyr-1 groundwater for irrigation, a value close to the theoretical value of 150mmyr-1 to avoid a continuing decline in the groundwater table in this region. However, W/S-M treatment had grain yield reductions of -23% and M treatment had -30%, and only W/M-M maintained grain yields relative to Chem. W/M. We therefore recommend the W/M-M management package as a preferred option to maintain grain yields together with low GWP and GHGI while mitigating the decline in the groundwater table in areas with a high water deficit. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Alternative cropping systems; Grain yield; Groundwater; Intensive agriculture; Net GWP and GHGI; Nitrogen input","Adviento-Borbe, M.A.A., Haddix, M.L., Binder, D.L., Walters, D.T., Dobermann, A., Soil greenhouse gas fluxes and global warming potential in four high-yielding maize systems (2007) Glob.

However, because of high variability on short (i.e., diurnal, seasonal, and annual) timescales as well as the recency of a comprehensive instrumental record, it is difficult to detect or provide evidence for long-term, site-specific trends in ocean temperature. Here we analyze five in situ datasets from Florida Keys coral reef habitats, including historic measurements taken by lighthouse keepers, to provide three independent lines of evidence supporting approximately 0.8 °C of warming in sea surface temperature (SST) over the last century. Results indicate that the warming observed in the records between 1878 and 2012 can be fully accounted for by the warming observed in recent decades (from 1975 to 2007), documented using in situ thermographs on a mid-shore patch reef. The magnitude of warming revealed here is similar to that found in other SST datasets from the region and to that observed in global mean surface temperature. The geologic context and significance of recent ocean warming to coral growth and population dynamics are discussed, as is the future prognosis for the Florida reef tract. © 2014, The Author(s).","Coral growth; Coral reef degradation; Florida reef tract; Global climate change; In situ temperature; Sea surface temperature","Albright, R., Mason, B., Miller, M., Langdon, C., Ocean acidification compromises recruitment success of the threatened Caribbean coral Acropora palmata (2010) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 107, pp. 20400-20404. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3cXhsFaju7fJ; Baird, A.H., Sommer, B., Madin, J.S., Pole-ward range expansion of Acropora spp. along the east coast of Australia (2012) Coral Reefs, 31, p. 1063; Barnett, T.P., Pierce, D.W., AchutaRao, K.M., Gleckler, P.J., Santer, B.D., Gregory, J.M., Washington, W.M., Penetration of human-induced warming into the world's oceans (2005) Science, 309, pp. 284-287. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2MXlsl2jt7s%3D; Burman, S.G., Aronson, R.B., van Woesik, R., Biotic homogenization of coral assemblages along the Florida reef tract (2012) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 467, pp. 89-96; Burrows, M.T., Schoeman, D.S., Buckley, L.B., Moore, P., Poloczanska, E.S., Brander, K.M., Brown, C., Richardson, A.J., The pace of shifting climate in marine and terrestrial ecosystems (2011) Science, 334, pp. 652-655. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3MXhtlyqu7jN; Cai, W., Borlace, S., Lengaigne, M., van Rensch, P., Collins, M., Vecchi, G., Timmermann, A., Fei-Fei, J., Increasing frequency of extreme El Niño events due to greenhouse warming (2014) Nature Climate Change, 4, pp. 111-116. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXhvVGnsLvJ; Cantin, N.E., Cohen, A.L., Karnauskas, K.B., Tarrant, A.M., McCorkle, D.C., Ocean warming slows coral growth in the Central Red Sea (2010) Science, 329, pp. 322-325. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3cXosl2itbo%3D; Castillo, K.D., Lima, F.P., Comparison of in situ and satellite-derived (MODIS-Aqua/Terra) methods for assessing temperature on coral reefs (2010) Limnology and Oceanography: Methods, 8, pp. 107-117; Chollett, I., Muller-Karger, F.E., Heron, S.F., Skirving, W., Mumby, P.J., Seasonal and spatial heterogeneity of recent sea surface temperature trends in the Caribbean Sea and southeast Gulf of Mexico (2012) Marine Pollution Bulletin, 64, pp. 956-965. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38Xmt1Whtb0%3D; Cohen, A.L., McCorkle, D.C., de Putron, S., Gaetani, G.A., Rose, K.A., Morphological and compositional changes in the skeletons of new coral recruits reared in acidified seawater: insights into the biomineralization response to ocean acidification (2009) Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, 10, pp. 1-12; Colella, M.A., Ruzicka, R.R., Kidney, J.A., Morrison, J.M., Brinkhuis, V.B., Cold-water event of January 2010 results in catastrophic benthic mortality on patch reefs in the Florida Keys (2012) Coral Reefs, 31, pp. 621-632; Cooper, T.F., O'Leary, R.A., Lough, J.M., Growth of Western Australian corals in the anthropocene (2012) Science, 335, pp. 593-596. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38XhsVequrc%3D; Dean, L., (1998) Lighthouses of the Florida Keys, , Pineapple Press, Inc., Sarasota, FL:; Druffel, E.R.M., Geochemistry of corals: proxies of past ocean chemistry, ocean circulation, and climate (1997) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 94, pp. 8354-8361. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DyaK2sXltlWitb8%3D; Duarte, C.M., Hendriks, I.E., Moore, T.S., Olsen, Y.S., Steckbauer, A., Ramajo, L., Carstensen, J., McCulloch, M., Is ocean acidification an open-ocean syndrome?

There is dearth of information in rainfed agriculture in general and conservation agriculture in particular, hence a study was conducted to assess the EUE and GHG emissions of different tillage practices like conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT) and zero tillage (ZT) and residue levels (harvesting heights resulting in 0, 10 and 30. cm anchored residue) in pigeonpea-castor systems under semi-arid rainfed regions of India. CT recorded 30 and 31% higher energy inputs than ZT in pigeonpea and castor, respectively. The fuel consumption in ZT was 58 and 81% lower than CT in pigeonpea and castor, respectively. This lower fuel consumption in ZT reduced the GHG emissions by 21 and 23% in pigeonpea and castor, respectively, in comparison with CT. EUE and energy productivity were maximum in ZT with 10. cm anchored residue. Further, castor grown on pigeonpea residue recorded 10 and 20% higher energy inputs and GHG emissions over pigeonpea grown on castor residues. Our results indicate that, reduction in one tillage operation with residue have a minimal impact on the crop yields but have a substantial environmental benefits. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cajanus cajan (L.); Energy balance; Greenhouse gas emissions; Ricinus communis (L.); Tillage","Aggarwal, R.K., Kaul, P., Loss of nitrogen as ammonia volatilization from urea on loamy sand soil of Jodhpur (1978) Ann.

In this paper, we applied this model to highland and midland Neotropical localities. We used pollen analysis of lake sediments to record vegetation responses to YD climatic changes, which are reconstructed from independent paleoclimatic proxies such as the Mg/Ca ratio on foraminiferal tests and Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) for paleotemperature, and grayscale density and Titanium content for paleoprecipitation. Paleoclimatic reconstructions at both highlands and midlands showed a clear YD signal with a conspicuous warming extending into the early Holocene. A small percentage of taxa resulted to be sensitive to these YD climate changes. Response lags were negligible at the resolution of the study. However, changes in the sensitive taxa were relevant enough to determine changes in biodiversity and taxonomic composition. Highland vegetation experienced mainly intra-community reorganizations, whereas midland vegetation underwent major changes leading to community substitutions. This was explained in terms of threshold-crossing non-linear responses in which the coupling of climatic and other forcings (fire) was proposed as the main driving mechanism. Paleoecology provides meaningful insights on the responses of highland and midland Neotropical vegetation to the YD climatic reversal. Biotic responses at both individual (species) and collective (assemblage) levels showed patterns and processes of vegetation change useful to understand its ecological dynamics, as well as the mechanisms and external drivers involved. The use of paleoecological methods to document the biotic responses to the YD climate shifts can be useful to help forecasting the potential consequences of future global warming. Due to its quasi-global character, the YD reversal emerges as a well suited candidate for providing useful insights of global scope by analyzing the corresponding biotic responses virtually at any geographical and biological setting. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Biotic responses; Global warming; Neotropics; Paleoclimates; Past analogs; Younger Dryas","Alley, R.B., Marotzke, J., Norhaus, W.D., Overpeck, J.T., Peteet, D.M., Pielke, R.A., Pierrehumbert, R.T., Wallace, J.M., Abrupt climate change (2003) Science, 299, pp. 2005-2010; Ammann, B., Birks, H.J.B., Brooks, S.J., Eicher, U., von Grafenstein, U., Hofmann, W., Lemdahl, G., Wick, L., Quantification of biotic responses to rapid climatic changes around the Younger Dryas-a synthesis (2000) Palaeogeogr.

However, only a small number of detailed assessments in selected regions have confirmed a climate response on the part of forest vegetation. Aims: This study aimed to analyse the relative contributions of temperature and other factors to range shifts in forest vegetation by comparing old and revisited relevés in Swiss forests. Methods: In order to investigate such range shifts, we revisited 451 relevé plots in forests in all parts of Switzerland. Collected data comprise two independent samples, one dating from the 1950s (age 60 sample) on 126 plots and the other dating from the 1990s (age 15 sample) on 325 plots. We defined an indicator value for elevation to estimate the upslope and downslope range shifts of forest species. The influence of different site factors on range shifts was assessed by variance partitioning using Landolt’s (2010) averaged species indicator values. Vegetation changes were analysed by balancing both increasing and decreasing frequencies of plant species. Results: Our findings show significant differences between the two survey periods, where the averaged species indicator for elevation varied greatly in both the age-60 and the age-15 samples. In addition, a significant upslope shift in the herbaceous forest layer (herbs and tree regeneration) of about 10 m per decade since the mid-twentieth century is evident. Downslope shifts were detected in the shrub/tree layer at lower elevations, which may be explained by factors other than climate warming. Conclusions: To date, the impact of global warming on tree species composition in Swiss forests has been weaker in comparison to the effects arising from forest management and land use change. Understorey vegetation, however, shows a strong signal of upslope shift that may be explained most adequately by a combination of climate change and other factors. © 2014, INRA and Springer-Verlag France.","Elevational shifts; Forest vegetation; Global warming; Indicator values; Species distribution; Variance partitioning","Araújo, M.B., Guisan, A., Five (or so) challenges for species distribution modelling (2006) J Biogeogr, 33, pp. 1677-1688; Bertrand, R., Lenoir, J., Piedallu, C., Riofrio-Dillon, G., de Ruffray, P., Vidal, C., Pierrat, J.-C., Gégout, J.-C., Changes in plant community composition lag behind climate warming in lowland forests (2011) Nature, 479, pp. 517-520. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3MXhtlCht7%2FL, PID: 22012261; Bolliger, J., Kienast, F., Zimmermann, N.E., Risks of global warming on montane and subalpine forests in Switzerland—a modeling study (2000) Reg Envir Change, 1, pp. 99-111; Brändli, U.-B., Schweizerisches Landesforstinventar.

Compound 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (CH3CCl2F, HCFC-141b) has an ozone depleting potential (ODP, 0.11) and global warming potential (GWP, 782), and is widely used in the polyurethane foam and solvent sectors in China. This study compiles a comprehensive emission inventory of HCFC-141b during 2000-2013 and makes a projection to 2050. Our results showed that HCFC-141b emissions in China increased from 0.8Gg/yr (0.6 CO2-eq Tg/yr) in 2000 to 15.8Gg/yr (12.4 CO2-eq Tg/yr) in 2013 with an accelerated growth rate. The provincial emission distribution showed that Shandong, Jiangsu, and Guangdong are key emission areas in China. A large amount of stock was retained in installed equipment, which may have an impact in the future. For future phasing-out, it was estimated that under the Montreal Planned Phase-out scenario (MPP), the accumulative reduction of HCFC-141b emissions during 2014-2050 would be 3071.0Gg (2401.5 CO2-eq Tg) compared to that under the Business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. This study reviewed and predicted HCFC-141b emissions and their environmental impacts in China. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","HCFC-141b; National emission inventory; Phase-out scenario; Provincial distribution","(2010) Energy Information Administration (EIA), , United States Department of Energy; Barletta, B., Meinardi, S., Simpson, I.J., Sherwood Rowland, F., Chan, C., Wang, X., Zou, S., Blake, D.R., Ambient halocarbon mixing ratios in 45 Chinese cities (2006) Atmos.

Global concern on this phenomenon has put forward the microalgal-based CO<inf>2</inf> sequestration aiming to sequester carbon back to the biosphere, ultimately reducing greenhouse effects. Microalgae have recently gained enormous attention worldwide, to be the valuable feedstock for renewable energy production, due to their high growth rates, high lipid productivities and the ability to sequester carbon. The photosynthetic process of microalgae uses atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> and CO<inf>2</inf> from flue gases, to synthesize nutrients for their growth. In this review article, we will primarily discuss the efficiency of CO<inf>2</inf> biosequestration by microalgae species, factors influencing microalgal biomass productions, microalgal cultivation systems, the potential and limitations of using flue gas for microalgal cultivation as well as the bio-refinery approach of microalgal biomass. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomass production; CO<inf>2</inf> sequestration; Fixation efficiency; Flue gas; Microalgae","Anjos, M., Fernandes, B.D., Vicente, A.A., Teixeira, J.A., Dragone, G., Optimization of CO<inf>2</inf> bio-mitigation by Chlorella vulgaris (2013) Bioresour.

We analyze how general equilibrium effects operating through the international capital market affect this Green Paradox. In a two-region, two-period world with identical homothetic preferences and without investment, the global interest rate falls and the Green Paradox weakens. With investment or a relatively more impatient oil-importing region, the Green Paradox may be strengthened because the future oil demand function shifts downward or because the interest rate rises. If the oil-importing region is very much more patient than the oil-exporting region, the Green Paradox may be reversed but in our calibrated model the effects are tiny. With exploration and endogenous initial oil reserves, a future carbon tax lowers cumulative oil extraction in partial equilibrium. If the boost to current oil extraction is weakened, strengthened or reversed in general equilibrium, so is the fall in cumulative extraction. A partial and general equilibrium welfare analysis of a future carbon tax, both for full and partial exhaustion, is given. The effects of stock-dependent extraction costs are separately discussed in an Appendix. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Capital markets; Carbon tax; General equilibrium; Global warming; Green Paradox","Cairns, R., The economics of exploration for non-renewable resources (1990) J.

In order to inspect their asexual reproduction performance in climate regimes associated with global warming, variations of podocyst reproduction and strobilation were investigated at five different temperature regimes (approximate simulation of summer in warm years and cold years: temperature increased from 18 to 25°C and then decreased to 18 and 10°C in three months, respectively; approximate simulation of autumn in warm years and cold years: temperature decreased from 18 to 10°C in two and three months, respectively; control: constant 18°C), and three food frequencies (once per 3d, once per 6d, and unfed). Strobilation in C. nozakii occurred at warmer temperature (≥18°C) but lower temperature (≤18°C) in N. nomurai. More than 90% of ephyrae of C. nozakii and N. nomurai were released in the thermal ranges of 22–25°C and 10–13°C, respectively. Higher percentages of polyps produced podocysts, and increased podocyst production was observed at warmer temperature (>18°C) and more food supplies in both species. The numbers of ephyrae in C. nozakii and podocysts in N. nomurai were significantly increased by prolonged duration of 18–25°C in summer during warm years. Simultaneously, prolonged duration of 10–18°C significantly increased strobilation percentage, ephyra, and podocyst production in N. nomurai in the autumn. More polyps of N. nomurai strobilating in the autumn proved adverse to outbreaks of medusae in the following summer. The results of this study indicate that the response of asexual reproduction to ocean warming appears species specific. Increased ephyra production in C. nozakii but higher podocyst reproduction in N. nomurai is expected in summer and autumn during warm years. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland","Ephyra production; Global warming; Jellyfish bloom; Podocyst reproduction; Strobilation",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928692862

Ice algae are reported to contribute 4-26% of overall Arctic Ocean primary production and are an important food source for the ice-associated ecosystem. Thus, it is important to estimate the future impacts of global warming on the contribution of ice algae to Arctic primary production. Primary production models, describing the relationships between ice-algal physiology and population dynamics, with environmental forcing and trophic interactions involving bacteria and grazers, can be applied to quantify such impacts. One important aspect in these models is how to represent the vertical distribution of ice algae in sea ice. In most models, only the bottom ice layer is considered where most of the algal biomass tends to be concentrated. However, since ice algae are also present along the entire ice column, this may lead to underestimation of ice-algal production. Some empirical data and model results suggest that ice algae located in the surface and interior layers may be kept at lower concentrations, in spite of high growth rates, due to grazing by micro- and meiofauna. Results obtained in this study show the importance of resolving vertically the distribution of ice algae to avoid bias in primary production estimates, well in line with empirical studies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Abiotic factors; Arctic Ocean; Ice algae; Limiting factors; Marine ecology; Modeling; Sea ice","Arrigo, K.R., Sea ice ecosystems (2014) Annu.

Gaseous fuel mixtures such as biogas, syngas, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are new alternative fuels that have great potential to be used with combustion engines. In the present work, laminar flame speeds (SL) of alternative fuel mixtures, mainly LPG (60% butane, 20% isobutane, and 20% propane) and methane have been studies using the tube method at ambient conditions. In addition, the effect of adding other fuels and gases such as hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen on SL has also been investigated. The results show that any change in the fuel mixture composition directly affects SL. Measurements of SL of CH4/LPG-air mixtures have found to be about 56cm/s at ø=1.1 with 60% LPG in the mixture, which is higher than SL of both pure fuels at the same ø. Moreover, the addition of H2 and O2 to the fuel mixtures increases SL notably, while the addition of CO2/N2 mixture to the fuel mixture, to simulate the EGR effect, decreases SL of CH4/LPG-air mixtures.

Policy measures include regulations at the technical level and the introduction of white certificates in order to force utilities and firms to invest into conservation in a way similar to the already existing renewable energy quota.

However, CO2 sequestration-induced chemical and mineralogical reactions affect the hydro-mechanical characteristics of natural formations, resulting in limited injectability to aquifers. A detailed knowledge of the hydro-mechanical behaviour of natural formations is therefore important to enhance the safety and effectiveness of the CO2 storage process. Such understanding can only be gained on the basis of in-depth knowledge of the applied effective stresses on the formations. The aim of this study was therefore to understand the effect of reservoir salinity level on the effective stress parameters of deep saline aquifer rock under various in-situ conditions, including salinity levels ranging from 0 to 30% (NaCl concentration by weight) and confining pressures ranging 20-35MPa. Tri-axial permeability tests were conducted for a range of injection pressures (1-12MPa) under different confining pressures (20, 25, 30 and 35MPa) at 35°C constant temperature. Comprehensive SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and acoustic emission analyses were also conducted to clarify the observed results.According to the results, the effective stress coefficient (α) for CO2 permeability decreases with increasing aquifer salinity level, and increasing salinity level from 0 to 30% causes the effective stress coefficient to be reduced by 31%. Moreover, the Skempton coefficient (B) increases with increasing salinity level from 0 to 30% and the increment is about 18%. Interestingly, the poro-elastic coupling parameter (αB) decreases from 0.89 to 0.72 as the salinity level increases from 0 to 30% and the reduction is about 19%. The SEM analysis conducted on tested samples confirmed the deposition of NaCl crystals in rock pore space during the saturation period of one year, and these observed variations in effective stress parameters are probably due to the NaCl crystal deposition in the rock pore space. This significantly alters the rock porosity and pore geometry, causing the simple effective stress law for CO2 permeability to be inapplicable to saline aquifers. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 sequestration; Effective stress parameters; Permeability; Saline aquifers","Al-Wardy, W., (2003) Analytical and Experimental Study of the Poro-elastic Behaviour of Clean and Clay-rich Sandstones, , PhD thesis, Imperial College, London; Al-Wardy, W., Zimmerman, R.W., Effective stress law for the permeability of clay-rich sandstone (2004) J.Geophys.

Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plants are an option in the attempt to mitigate the effect of CO2 emissions, because they can be fuelled or co-fuelled with biomass, but also, very importantly, because they can be equipped with pre-combustion CO2 capture units. Moreover, the rapidly growing share of electricity produced by converting renewable energy sources demands for more flexible operation of future IGCC plants in order to compensate for inherently intermittent operation of wind and solar power plants. The CO2 capture unit should therefore be able to follow the dynamic operation of the power plant, and, at the same time, meet environmental targets in terms of CO2 removal. In order to investigate and improve the transient performance of such complex systems, dynamic process simulations performed with accurate physically based models are essential. This paper presents the development and validation of the dynamic model of the absorption and solvent regeneration unit as part of a pre-combustion CO2 capture system, with focus on the absorber column model. The models are implemented into an open source software library following an object-oriented, equation-based modelling approach using the Modelica language. The models are validated by comparison against two sets of transient experimental data generated at the CO2 capture pilot plant realized and operated at the Buggenum IGCC power station in the Netherlands. The model predictions satisfactorily reproduce the dynamic performance of the pilot plant considering the main process variables, such as pressures, flow rates and compositions. One of the results of this work is that, in case of physical absorption of CO2 a well-tuned, equilibrium-based absorber model is able to accurately predict transient operation. The validated process models enable process and control system design aiming at improvement of transient performance of the pre-combustion capture unit. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Dynamic model validation; Dynamic process modelling; PC-SAFT; Physical absorption; Pre-combustion CO2 capture","Åkesson, J., Faber, R., Laird, C., Tummescheit, H., Velut, S., Zhu, Y., Models of a post-combustion absorption unit for simulation, optimization and non-linear model predictive control schemes (2011) Proceedings 8th International Modelica Conference; (2013), http://www.aspentech.com, Aspen Plus V7.3Biliyok, C., Lawal, A., Wang, M., Seibert, F., Dynamic modelling, validation and analysis of post-combustion chemical absorption CO2 capture plant (2012) Int.

Here we focus on bryophyte communities in streams characterized by a strong altitudinal gradient. The main purpose of this study was to determine the most important environmental variables affecting bryophyte species richness and composition and to quantify the relative importance of different sets of environmental variables. We studied bryophyte communities at upstream, intermediate and downstream sections of 16 streams distributed on the northern and southern side of Madeira Island in the Atlantic Ocean. We found that bryophyte species richness and composition was strongly affected by the measured environmental variables. Of particular importance were the geomorphological and hydrological variables as well as the chemical and physical properties of the streams. Temperature (or altitude) was highly correlated with other variables reflecting clear altitudinal gradients. While upstream communities were generally in a rather natural condition and rich in bryophyte species, downstream communities had less species and often anthropogenically modified stream banks. Due to the confounding of downstream areas with human influences and other variables such as temperature, the separate effects of these variables are not known. The relationship and the distributions of some bryophyte species/communities across the altitudinal range suggest that these riparian bryophyte communities may be sensitive to global warming. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Bryophytes; Community predictors; Ecological indicators; Freshwater habitats; Macaronesia; WFD","Ah-Peng, C., Rausch de Traubenberg, C., Aquatic bryophytes as pollutant accumulators and ecophysiological bioindicators of stress: bibliographic synthesis (2004) Cryptogam.

One of these unconventional fuels is sour gas, which consists of methane, hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. Using this fuel poses many challenges because of the toxic and corrosive nature of its combustion products. A promising technology for utilizing it is oxy-fuel combustion with carbon capture and storage, including the potential of enhanced oil recovery for added economic benefits. Although methane oxy-fuel cycles have been studied in the literature, using sour gas as the fuel has not been investigated or considered. In this paper, water is used as the diluent to control the flame temperature in the combustion process, and the associated cycle type is modeled to examine its performance. As the working fluid condenses, sulfuric acid forms which causes corrosion. Therefore, either expensive acid resistant materials should be used, or a redesign of the cycle is required. These different options are explored. A cost analysis of the proposed systems is also conducted to provide preliminary estimates for the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The results show the acid resistance cycle with a 4.5% points increase in net efficiency over the cycle with SOx removal. However there is nearly a 9% decrease in the cycle's LCOE for the latter case. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 capture and sequestration; Oxy-fuel combustion; Power cycle analysis; Sour gas","Abu-Zahra, M.R., Niederer, J.P., Feron, P.H., Versteeg, G.F., CO2 capture from power plants: Part II.

The life cycle assessment (LCA) approach has been widely adopted to assess the ""carbon footprint"" of agricultural products, but rarely used as a tool to identify effective mitigation strategies. In this study, the global warming impacts of no-till (NT) vs. conventional till (CT), stubble retention (SR) vs. stubble burning (SB), and N fertilization (NF) vs. no N fertilization (N0) in an Australian wheat cropping system were assessed using in situ measurements of N2O fluxes over three years, SOC changes over forty years and including other supply chain GHG sources and sinks. The results demonstrated the importance of full GHG accounting compared to considering SOC changes or N2O emissions alone for assessing the global warming impacts of different management practices, and highlighted the significance of accurately accounting for SOC changes and N2O emissions in LCAs. The GHG footprints of wheat production were on averaged 475kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) ha-1 (or 186kg CO2-e t-1 grain) higher under NF than N0. Where fertilizer N was applied (70kgNha-1), the life cycle emissions were 200kg CO2-e ha-1 (or 87t-1 grain) lower under NT than CT and 364kg CO2-e ha-1 (or 155t-1 grain) lower under SR than SB. Classification of the emission sources/sinks and re-calculation of published data indicated that under the common practices of SR combined with NT, N-related GHG emissions contributed 60-95% of the life cycle emissions in the predominantly rain-fed wheat production systems in Australia. Therefore, future mitigation efforts should aim to improve N use efficiency, explore non-synthetic N sources, and most importantly avoid excessive N fertilizer use whilst practising NT and SR. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon footprints; LCA; Mitigation; Nitrogen fertilization; No-till; Stubble management","(2013) Agricultural Commodity Statistics 2013, p. 238. , Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, Canberra; (2006) Australian Transport Facts, , Australian Transport Energy Data and Analysis Centre, Victoria, Australia; Baggs, E.M., Rees, R.M., Smith, K.A., Winten, A.J.A., Nitrous oxide emission from soils after incorporating crop residues (2000) Soil Use Manage., 16, pp. 82-87; Biswas, W.K., Barton, L., Carter, D., Global warming potential of wheat production in Western Australia - a life cycle assessment (2008) Water, 22, pp. 1-11; Biswas, W.K., Graham, J., Kelly, K., John, M.B., Global warming contributions from wheat, sheep meat and wool production in Victoria, Australia - a life cycle assessment (2010) J.

The natural disturbance dynamics there have historically been driven by fire and insects, with human-mediated disturbances increasing faster than in other biomes globally. Previous research on the total boreal carbon stock and predictions of its future flux reveal high uncertainty in regional patterns. We reviewed and standardised this extensive body of quantitative literature to provide the most up-to-date and comprehensive estimates of the global carbon balance in the boreal forest. We also compiled century-scale predictions of the carbon budget flux. Our review and standardisation confirmed high uncertainty in the available data, but there is evidence that the region's total carbon stock has been underestimated. We found a total carbon store of 367.3 to 1715.8 Pg (1015g), the mid-point of which (1095 Pg) is between 1.3 and 3.8 times larger than any previous mean estimates. Most boreal carbon resides in its soils and peatlands, although estimates are highly uncertain. We found evidence that the region might become a net carbon source following a reduction in carbon uptake rate from at least the 1980s. Given that the boreal potentially constitutes the largest terrestrial carbon source in the world, in one of the most rapidly warming parts of the globe (Walsh, 2014), how we manage these stocks will be influential on future climate dynamics. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Alaska; Canada; Ecosystems; Fire; Flux; Insects; Peatland; Permafrost; Russia; Scandinavia; Soil; Taiga","Adams, J.M., Faure, H., Faure-Denard, L., McGlade, J.M., Woodward, F.I., Increases in terrestrial carbon storage from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present (1990) Nature, 348, pp. 711-714; Anderson-Teixeira, K.J., DeLucia, E.H., The greenhouse gas value of ecosystems (2011) Glob.

It is mainly endemic in subtropical or tropical countries and has not been reported since 2009 in the Tohoku region (northern Japan), including the Yamagata and Miyagi Prefectures. However, we experienced four patients with leptospirosis in the Tohoku region from 2012 to 2014; three patients (#1-3) live in the agricultural areas of the Yamagata Prefecture and one patient (#4) was a visitor to the Miyagi Prefecture. Patient 1 (81-year-old female) is a villager, with a rat bite, while Patient 2 (77-year-old male) and Patient 3 (84-year-old female) are farmers and were infected probably during agriculture work. Patient 4 (40-year-old male US citizen) was infected while traveling in Thailand. They had chief complaint of fever, headache, and myalgia and showed manifestations of hyperbilirubinemia (mean, 4.35 mg/dL), thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury (AKI). All patients were diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction using blood and/or urine samples and a microscopic agglutination test for the anti-Leptospira antibody. All the patients were treated with infused antibiotics, including minocycline. The patients underwent hemodialysis due to severe AKI (mean serum creatinine, 4.44 mg/dL), except for Patient 2 with the normal serum creatinine level (1.12 mg/dL). All the patients recovered and were discharged. The presence of the three patients in the Yamagata Prefecture implies that leptospirosis does re-emerge in the Tohoku region. Therefore, careful survey of the pathogen is necessary for febrile patients with AKI who engage in agriculture or have a recent history of travelling in subtropical or tropical countries. © 2015 Tohoku University Medical Press.","Disaster; Global warming; Hemodialysis; Leptospirosis; Outbreak","Akiyama, K., Ueki, Y., Okimura, Y., Goto, I., Shiraishi, H., A fatal case of Weil’s disease in Miyagi Prefecture (2001) Jpn.

The framework is used to quantify the impact of a state-level renewable portfolio standard (RPS) achieved predominately with solar generation. We perform the analysis using Arizona's RPS as a case study over the period 2012-2035. We find if Arizona implements its RPS when supplying future electricity demand, there will be an increase in electricity rates (relative to a business-as-usual scenario of reliance on gas-fired generation). Extending the current regime of tax credits greatly reduces this increase, at the taxpayers' expense. We find that by 2025 Arizona's RPS will implicitly abate carbon dioxide emissions at a cost between $58 and $82 per metric ton, and by 2035 abatement costs are between $22 and $69 per metric ton (depending on the future evolution of nature gas prices). The RPS always leads to a negative impact on social welfare under low gas prices, but after 2029 the welfare impact is positive under high gas prices. In contrast, phasing out Arizona's existing coal-fired generation always has positive welfare impacts. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Electricity demand; Renewable portfolio standard; Solar","Birol, F., Keppler, J.H., Prices, technology development and the rebound effect (2000) Energy Policy, 28, pp. 457-469; Boccard, N., Capacity factor of wind power realized values vs. estimates (2009) Energy Policy, 37, pp. 2679-2688; Brännlund, R., Lundgren, T., A dynamic analysis of interfuel substitution for Swedish heating plants (2004) Energy Econ., 26 (6), pp. 961-976; Chavas, J.P., Segerson, K., Singularity and autoregressive disturbances in linear logit models (1986) J.

Researchers are strongly driven to pursue the next generation of vegetable oil-based biodiesel. Oleaginous microalgae are considered to be a promising alternative oil source. To commercialize microalgal biodiesel, cost reductions in oil extraction and downstream biodiesel conversion are stressed. Herein, starting from an investigation of oil extraction from wet microalgae, a review is conducted of transesterification using enzymes, homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, and yield enhancement by ultrasound, microwave, and supercritical process. In particular, there is a focus on direct transesterification as a simple and energy efficient process that omits a separate oil extraction step and utilizes wet microalgal biomass; however, it is still necessary to consider issues such as the purification of microalgal oils and upgrading of biodiesel properties. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Biodiesel; Direct transesterification; Energy balance; Wet microalgae; Wet oil extraction","Barreiro, D.L., Prins, W., Ronsse, F., Brilman, W., Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae for biofuel production: state of the art review and future prospects (2013) Biomass Bioenergy, 53, pp. 113-127; Baumgartner, T.R.S., Burak, J.A.M., Baumgartner, D., Zanin, G.M., Arroyo, P.A., Biomass production and ester synthesis by in situ transesterification/esterification using the microalga Spirulina platensis (2013) Int.

The study aims to determine the morphological and physiological effects of trinexapac-ethyl (TE) foliar biweekly sprays with 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 L ha−1 and/or four irrigation intervals of 1, 2, 3 and 4 days on Ocimum basilicum bush green and purple ruffle cultivars grown in PVC containers under greenhouse conditions. After 8 weeks of irrigation intervals, basil cultivars exhibited significant reduction in leaf number and area, plant dry weight, root dry weight, plant height, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate, but increased essential oil content in leaves in both cultivars. The application of TE reduced leaf number, leaf area, plant dry weight and plant height but increased root dry weight, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and essential oil content in leaves in both cultivars compared to untreated plants at different irrigation intervals. The 4 days irrigation intervals and TE spray with 0.3 L ha−1 increased leaves essential oils quality and quantity compared to 1 day irrigation intervals in untreated plants, but at the same time reduced economic parameters such as plant dry weight. The results of this study suggest the possibility of growing basil cultivars under prolonged irrigation intervals using TE foliar sprays; however, the economic revenue needs to be evaluated. Reduction of plant biomass, increased root weight, and protective effects of TE on photosynthetic efficiency play a major role in drought avoidance mechanism in basil cultivars grown under moderate drought conditions. © 2015, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.","Bush green; Growth regulators; Ocimum basilicum; Purple ruffle; Stress tolerance","Adams, R.P., (2007) Identification of essential oil compounds by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, , Allured pub Corp, Carol Stream:; Álvarez, S., Sánchez-Blanco, M.J., Changes in growth rate, root morphology and water use efficiency of potted Callistemon citrinus plants in response to different levels of water deficit (2013) Sci Hort, 156, pp. 54-62; Aphalo, P.J., Sanchez, R.A., Stomatal responses of light and drought stress in variegated leaves of Hedera helix (1986) Plant Physiol, 81, pp. 768-773. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DyaL28XkslKhtLk%3D, PID: 16664900; Arghavani, M., Kafi, M., Babalar, M., Naderi, R., Improvement of salt tolerance in Kentucky bluegrass by trinexapac-ethyl (2012) HortScience, 47, pp. 1163-1170; Atkinson, C.J., Else, M.A., Understanding how rootstocks dwarf fruit trees (2001) Compact Fruit Tree, 34, pp. 46-49; Barreiro, A.P., Zucareli, V., Ono, E.O., Rodrigues, J.D., Growth analysis of basil plants submitted to plant growth regulators (2006) Bragantia, 65, pp. 563-567; Beasley, J.S., Branham, B.E., Trinexapac-ethyl and paclobutrazol affect Kentucky bluegrass single-leaf carbon exchange rates and plant growth (2007) Crop Sci, 47, pp. 132-138. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2sXjsF2nurk%3D; Bian, X., Merewitz, E., Bingru, H., Effect of trinexapac-ethyl on drought responses in creeping bentgrass associated with water use and osmotic adjustment (2009) J Amer Soc Hort Sci, 134, pp. 505-510; Carović-Stanko, K., Orlić, S., Politeo, O., Strikic, F., Kolak, I., Milos, M., Satovic, Z., Composition and antibacterial activities of essential oils of seven Ocimum taxa (2010) Food Chem, 119, pp. 196-201; Chaves, M.M., Flexas, J., Pinheiro, C., Photosynthesis under drought and salt stress: regulation mechanisms from whole plant to cell (2009) Ann Bot, 103, pp. 551-560. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXktVGnu7s%3D, PID: 18662937; Correia, N.M., Leite, G.J., Selectivity of the plant growth regulators trinexapac-ethyl and sulfometuron-methyl to cultivated species (2011) Sci Agricola, 69, pp. 194-200; da Costa, A.S., Arrigoni-Blank, M.F., Filho, J.L.C., de Santana, A.D.D., Santos, D.A., Alves, P.B., Blank, A.F., Chemical diversity in bail (Ocimum sp.) germplasm (2015) Sci World J, p. 9; de Lima, R.S.N., de Assis, F.F.A.M.M., Martins, A.O., de Deus, B.C.S., Ferraz, T.M., de Assis Gomes, M.M., de Sousa, E.F., Campostrini, E., Partial rootzone drying (PRD) and regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) effects on stomatal conductance, growth, photosynthetic capacity, and water-use efficiency of papaya (2015) Sci Hortic, 183, pp. 13-22; Basil production.

With the rapid growth of smart grid, the use of demand response to dispatch loads with flexible consumption time and/or quantity has been a new trend in power industry. This paper proposes a new energy-saving dispatch problem while considering energy-saving and emission-reduction potentials of generation and demand sides, as well as the interaction between the two. A bi-level optimization model is established to address the interaction between the energy-saving dispatch of thermal units and that of users. The objective function of the upper level considers both the electric power generation cost and the carbon emission cost of thermal units, while the lower level integrates both compensation and incentive costs of electricity consumers into its objective function according to the influences of their regulation-based demand response to the power grid. Moreover, user benefits of reducing downtime and avoiding frequent load restarting are also considered in the lower layer model. An iterative algorithm is proposed and the improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) method is used to solve the lower-layer model for seeking the optimal compromise solution on the Pareto frontier, which is derived by maximum deviations and entropy-based multiple attributes decision making method. Comparing with general NSGA-II and multiobjective genetic algorithms, the improved NSGA-II method can improve the spatial distribution of Pareto solution set and reduce the number of iterations, thus having stronger consistency among multiple objective functions and better performance. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","Bi-level optimization; genetic algorithm; interactive energy-saving dispatch; nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II); objective function consistency; user-side emission reduction","Zakariazadeh, A., Jadid, S., Siano, P., Economic-environmental energy and reserve scheduling of smart distribution systems: A multiobjective mathematical programming approach (2014) Energy Convers.

Bacterial strains used in this study were Vibrio tapetis strain CECT4600T, the causative agent of Brown Ring Disease (BRD) and V.tapetis strain LP2, supposed less virulent to V.philippinarum. V.tapetis is considered to proliferate at low temperatures, i.e. under 21°C. In a global warming context we could hypothesize a decrease of mass mortalities caused by V.tapetis but these thermal changes could also directly impact the immune system of the host V.philippinarum. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the extrapallial injection with V.tapetis combined with temperature challenge on two enzymes activities in V.philippinarum. More precisely, after infection, phenoloxidase (PO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), two major enzymes involved in immune response, were studied for 30 days in two compartments: the mantle and the hemolymph. Conchyolin Deposit Stages (CDS) and Shell Repair Stages (SRS) were also determined 30 days post-injection as a proxy of the virulence of the tested strains. In this study, we highlighted that host-pathogen interaction in a varying environment affects the enzymatic response of the host. The coupled effect of V.tapetis injection and temperature challenge was detected 30 days post injection and resulted in virulence differences. These findings were supported by CDS and SRS determination in clams and lead to the conclusion that clam's immunity could be enhanced at 22°C while V.tapetis virulence is lowered at this temperature. Another result of our study was the increase of PO and SOD basal activities as clams are exposed to warmer temperature. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Phenoloxidase; Superoxide dismutase; Temperature; Venerupis philippinarum; Vibrio tapetis","Paillard, C., Allam, B., Oubella, R., Effect of temperature on defense parameters in manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum challenged with Vibrio tapetis (2004) Dis Aquat Org, 59, pp. 249-262; Byrne, M., Impact of climate change stressors on marine invertebrate life histories with a focus on the Mollusca and Echinodermata (2010) Climate alert: climate change monitoring and strategy, pp. 142-185. , University of Sydney Press, Sydney; Byrne, M., Global change ecotoxicology: identification of early life history bottlenecks in marine invertebrates, variable species responses and variable experimental approaches (2012) Mar Environ Res, 76, pp. 3-15; Harvell, C., Kim, K., Burkholder, J., Colwell, R., Epstein, P.R., Grimes, D., Emerging marine diseases-climate links and anthropogenic factors (1999) Science, 285, pp. 1505-1510; Harvell, C.D., Mitchell, C.E., Ward, J.R., Altizer, S., Dobson, A.P., Ostfeld, R.S., Climate warming and disease risks for terrestrial and marine biota (2002) Science, 296, pp. 2158-2162; Doney, S.C., Ruckelshaus, M., Duffy, J.E., Barry, J.P., Chan, F., English, C.A., Climate change impacts on marine ecosystems (2012) Mar Sci, 4; Canesi, L., Gallo, G., Gavioli, M., Pruzzo, C., Bacteria-hemocyte interactions and phagocytosis in marine bivalves (2002) Microsc Res Tech, 57, pp. 469-476; Paillard, C.A., Short-review of brown ring disease, a vibriosis affecting clams, Ruditapes philippinarum and Ruditapes decussatus (2004) Aquat Living Resour, 17, pp. 467-475; Flassch, J.-P., Leborgne, Y., Introduction in Europe, from 1972 to 1980, of the Japanese Manila clam (Tapes philippinarum) and the effects on aquaculture production and natural settlement (1992) Introductions and transfers of aquatic species selected papers from a symposium held in Halifax, Nova Scotia, 12-13 June 1990; Flassch, J.-P., Barret, J., Mazurie, J., Maes, P., Nicolas, J., Noel, T., L'elevage de la palourde, programme national de recherche sur la maladie de l'anneau brun.

The relationship between air temperature and premature mortality is widely recognized, however, it is not well defined in the aforementioned region. Methods: Daily cardiovascular mortality data and spatially aggregated daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures for the period 2004-2010 were analyzed using a case-crossover design combined with a distributed lag non-linear model. Results: A relationship between high temperatures and cardiovascular mortality was observed for cerebrovascular diseases, ischaemic and other heart diseases; this relationship was exacerbated on days with high temperatures. The highest relative risk was observed on the day of the heat event and remained significantly elevated for another day. The results were consistent regardless whether the minimum, maximum, or mean temperatures were used, although the association seems to be more pronounced with the mean temperatures, which suggests that consecutive high day- and night-time temperatures are the most hazardous. Conclusions: The identification of a positive relationship between high temperatures and cardiovascular mortality in Cyprus raises concerns. In view of the projected climate changes and strong increases in extreme heat events in the region, appropriate interventions need to be developed. © 2015 Lubczyńska et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Cardiovascular mortality; Case-crossover; Climate change; Cyprus; Distributed lags; Temperature",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929207815

The degree to which antecedent temperature regime and mineral protection of soil organic matter (OM) influence the temperature response of boreal soil C pools remains unknown, however. To investigate these phenomena on time scales relevant to anthropogenic climate change, we quantified the temperature response of four soil C pools (L, F and H organic horizons and B mineral horizon) within soil profiles collected from replicated sites representing two regions along a climate transect (""regional warming"") during a 480-day incubation at 5 and 15°C (""experimental warming""). We hypothesized that 1) warmer region soils would exhibit reduced bioreactivity, a measure of C lability assessed via cumulative soil C mineralization, relative to colder region soils, paralleling a decrease in bioreactivity with depth in both regions, and 2) temperature sensitivity of C mineralization (denoted as Q<inf>10</inf>) would increase with decreasing bioreactivity congruent with the ""C quality-temperature"" (CQT) hypothesis, with a smaller effect in mineral soil where physico-chemical protection likely occurs. Cumulative C mineralization decreased from surface L to deeper horizons and from the cold to warm region for organic F and H horizons only. This decrease in soil bioreactivity with depth was paralleled by an increase in Q<inf>10</inf> with depth as expected, except in mineral soil where Q<inf>10</inf> was similar to or lower relative to the overlying organic layer. The lower bioreactivity in F and H horizons of the warm relative to the cold region was not, however, associated with a greater Q<inf>10.</inf> A warmer regional climate in these otherwise similar forests thus resulted in reduced bioreactivity of isolated soil C pools without increasing the temperature sensitivity of soil C mineralization. This suggests that assumptions about temperature sensitivity of C mineralization based on the propensity for isolated organic C pools to undergo mineralization may not be valid in some organic-rich, boreal forest soils. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Boreal forest ecosystems; Carbon quality-temperature hypothesis; Climate transect; Laboratory incubation; Temperature sensitivity of decomposition","Ågren, G.I., Wetterstedt, J.Å.M., What determines the temperature response of soil organic matter decomposition?

In particular, the response of the productivity-decay balance to climate variability is critical for understanding both the past and future global C cycle. Most studies of peatland C dynamics have been carried out on boreal and subarctic peatlands, where climate models predict a greater increase in temperature compared to the global average. Less is known about peatlands at lower latitudes, yet there are significant peatland C stocks in these regions that may be more vulnerable to future climate change because they are closer to the climatic limit of peatland distribution. Northeast China is China's largest wetland region, with extensive peatlands in mountain regions and across the plains. Here, we used core data from 134 peatland sites to quantify the C accumulation rate over different timescales and estimate C storage across northeast China. The results show that the Holocene long-term apparent rate of C accumulation (LORCA) ranged from 5.74 to 129.31gCm-2yr-1, with a mean rate of 33.66gCm-2yr-1. The total wetland area and C storage within this region is 82,870km2 and 4.34GtC, and about 80% of the C is contained in mountain peatlands. We find that total C accumulated over the last 2000 years is linearly related to photosynthetically active radiation over the growing season, supporting the hypothesis that rates of net primary productivity (NPP) are more important than decomposition rates in determining long-term C accumulation. Although peatlands in northeast China are close to the southern limit of major peatland extent, our data suggest that future warming will lead to greater future C accumulation, as long as moisture balance or cloudiness do not become limiting factors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon accumulation; Carbon storage; Holocene; Northeast China; Peatland","Bao, K., Yu, X., Jia, L., Wang, G., Recent carbon accumulation in Changbai Mountain peatlands, northeast China (2010) Mt.

The advent of new generation global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) has heralded an exciting future for not only the GNSS community, but also many other areas that are critical to our society at large. With the rapid advances in space-based technologies and new dedicated space missions, the availability of large scale and dense contemporary GNSS networks such as regional continuously operating reference station (CORS) networks and the developments of new algorithms and methodologies, the ability of using space geodetic techniques to remotely sense the atmosphere (i.e., the troposphere and ionosphere) has dramatically improved. Real time GNSS-derived atmospheric variables with a high spatio-temporal resolution have become an important new source of measurements for meteorology, particularly for extreme weather events since water vapour (WV), as the most abundant element of greenhouse gas and accounting for  ∼ 70% of global warming, is under-sampled in current meteorological and climate observing systems. This study investigates the emerging area of GNSS technology for near real-time monitoring and forecasting of severe weather and climate change research. This includes both ground-based global positioning system (GPS)-derived precipitable water vapour (PWV) estimation and four-dimensional (4-D) tomographic modeling for wet refractivity fields. Two severe weather case studies were used to investigate the signature of GPS-derived PWV and wet refractivity derived from the 4-D GPS tomographic model under the influence of severe mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). GPS observations from the Victorian state-wide CORS network, i.e., GPSnet, in Australia were used. Results showed strong spatial and temporal correlations between the variations in the ground-based GPS-derived PWV and the passage of the severe MCS. This indicates that the GPS method can complement conventional meteorological observations for the studying, monitoring, and potentially predicting of severe weather events. The advantage of using the ground-based GPS technique is that it can provide continuous observations for the storm passage with high temporal and spatial resolution. Results from these two case studies also suggest that GPS-derived PWV can resolve the synoptic signature of the dynamics and offer precursors to severe weather, and the tomographic technique has the potential to depict the three-dimensional (3-D) signature of wet refractivity for the convective and stratiform processes evident in MCS events. This research reveals the potential of using GNSS-derived PWV to strengthen numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and forecasts, and the potential for GNSS-derived PWV and wet refractivity fields to enhance early detection and sensing of severe weather.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928963547

Many jurisdictions are now focusing on the 2020–2050 timeframe. We conduct an inter-model comparison of nine California statewide energy models with GHG mitigation scenarios to 2050 to better understand common insights across models, ranges of intermediate GHG targets (i.e., for 2030), necessary technology deployment rates, and future modeling needs for the state. The models are diverse in their representation of the California economy: across scenarios with deep reductions in GHGs, annual statewide GHG emissions are 8–46 % lower than 1990 levels by 2030 and 59–84 % lower by 2050 (not including the Wind-Water-Solar model); the largest cumulative reductions occur in scenarios that favor early mitigation; non-hydroelectric renewables account for 30–58 % of electricity generated for the state in 2030 and 30–89 % by 2050 (not including the Wind-Water-Solar model) ; the transportation sector is decarbonized using a mix of energy efficiency gains and alternative-fueled vehicles; and bioenergy is directed almost exclusively towards the transportation sector, accounting for a maximum of 40 % of transportation energy by 2050. Models suggest that without new policies, emissions from non-energy sectors and from high-global-warming-potential gases may alone exceed California’s 2050 GHG goal. Finally, future modeling efforts should focus on the: economic impacts and logistical feasibility of given scenarios, interactive effects between two or more climate policies, role of uncertainty in the state’s long-term energy planning, and identification of pathways that achieve the dual goals of criteria pollutant and GHG emission reduction. © 2015 The Author(s)",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928626395

Aphids are the model species in studying the association of insect biology with large-scale climate fluctuations because they multiply only within a certain range of temperatures and their rate of development directly depends on temperature. Here, we investigate the effect of climate warming on phenology and voltinism of the juniper aphid (Cinara juniperi De Geer 1773), a native species of a temperate climate zone in Poland. We also experimentally test for the temperature optimum of the study species. Our study demonstrated that environmental conditions significantly affected phenology of juniper aphid. The timing of larval emergence depended on mean temperatures in March, and in warmer years larvae appeared earlier. The emergence of the sexual generation was related to mean temperatures in August, and higher temperatures resulted in later sexual reproduction. Despite the elongation of the entire life cycle, by almost 3 months, we observed only one additional generation in warmer years. A possible explanation for this pattern may be that the increase in temperature recorded in recent years went beyond the temperature optimum of the study species. Our chamber experiment supports this assumption – juniper aphids developed faster and reproduced more effectively at 20 °C than at 25 °C. © 2015 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928780467

To be resilient, buildings will need the capacity to provide habitable indoor conditions without power for limited amounts of time.

Current research on building-related heat stress and numerous heat indices is examined in relation to the development of a new heat-safety metric for use in passively conditioned buildings. Most indoor overheating research relies on outdoor temperature data and has no common indoor heat index for evaluating indoor heat stress. A recommendation is made for using the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and predicted heat strain (PHS) indices for modelling and monitoring of indoor heat stress in healthy adult populations because both indices utilize the primary thermoregulation variables, have associated heat-stress thresholds, and can be assessed or tracked with existing environmental monitoring methods and predictive energy modelling techniques.

Although many studies suggest that global warming will accelerate carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) emissions from soil, the magnitude of this feedback is unknown, mostly due to uncertainty in the temperature sensitivity (Q<inf>10</inf>, increaing ratio of SR and MR after a 10°C increase of temperature) of SR and MR. To investigate the seasonal variation of short-term Q<inf>10</inf> and estimate how grazing impacts temperature sensitivity of SR and MR, we measured SR and MR in a fenced and a grazed grassland on the loess plateau, northwestern China, during 2008–2010. In this semiarid grassland ecosystem, soil temperature was the dominant factor controlling SR and MR during the experimental period. Short-term apparent Q<inf>10</inf> of SR and MR had a clearly seasonal variation, and was significantly and negatively related to soil temperature at 2-cm depth. However, no relationship was found between soil moisture (0–10 cm soil layer) and apparent Q<inf>10</inf>. By decreasing soil organic carbon and root biomass, grazing reduced the long-term Q<inf>10</inf> of SR and MR. In both the short term and the long term, Q<inf>10</inf> of MR was lower than that of SR, suggesting that autotrophic respiration is more sensitive than heterotrophic respiration to temperature.

The end of the era of cheap and abundant energy flows brings the issue of economic growth into question, stimulating research for alternatives as the de-growth proposal. The present paper applies the system dynamic global model WoLiM that allows economic, energy and climate dynamics to be analyzed in an integrated way. The results show that, if the growth paradigm is maintained, the decrease in fossil fuel extraction can only be partially compensated by renewable energies, alternative policies and efficiency improvements, very likely causing systemic energy shortage in the next decades. If a massive transition to coal would be promoted to try to compensate the decline of oil and gas and maintain economic growth, the climate would be then very deeply disturbed. The results suggest that growth and globalization scenarios are, not only undesirable from the environmental point of view, but also not feasible. Furthermore, regionalization scenarios without abandoning the current growth GDP focus would set the grounds for a pessimistic panorama from the point of view of peace, democracy and equity. In this sense, an organized material de-growth in the North followed by a steady state shows up as a valid framework to achieve global future human welfare and sustainability. The exercise qualitatively illustrates the magnitude of the challenge: the most industrialized countries should reduce, on average, their per capita primary energy use rate at least four times and decrease their per capita GDP to roughly present global average levels. Differently from the current dominant perceptions, these consumption reductions might actually be welfare enhancing. However, the attainment of these targets would require deep structural changes in the socioeconomic systems in combination with a radical shift in geopolitical relationships. © 2015 Springer Japan","Fossil fuel depletion; Global warming; Peak oil; Renewable limits; Scenarios; System dynamics",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928380934

Xylem traits, such as the number and cross-sectional area of earlywood vessels, are also critical parameters of forest growth because of the physiological and structural contribution of xylem to the growth of the tree stem. Forest productivity appears to be affected by climate change and, indeed, trees might be expected to acclimate to gradual long-term climate change. The aim of this study was to identify long-term changes in increases in stem diameter and in earlywood vessels by examining tree rings of Quercus crispula. Focusing on 20 mature specimens of Q. crispula, we examined annual ring growth from 1970 to 2004 and measured earlywood traits, namely, the width, cross-sectional area (henceforth referred to as area) and number of earlywood vessels, by digital image analysis. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model for detection of long-term trends in these traits. We found that earlywood width, as well as the total number and area of earlywood vessels, increased during the 35 years under analysis. One possible cause of these changes might be the long-term elevation of temperatures in early spring, which determine the timing of the onset of cambial reactivation from winter dormancy. In contrast to the long-term changes, short-term, yearly changes in earlywood traits fluctuated to a smaller extent than yearly changes in tree ring width. Therefore, the observed long-term changes in earlywood appear to represent acclimation to long-term climate change. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Deciduous broad-leaved forest; Global warming; Ring-porous trees; Tree ring width; Xylem anatomy",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928389919

The surface fields to drive CANOPA were provided by the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM), driven by the outputs from the third-generation Canadian Global Climate Model (CGCM3) following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B climate change scenario. The sea-ice concentration and volume simulated by CANOPA are shown to have patterns consistent with those seen in observations; CANOPA is also shown to simulate sea surface temperature (SST) well. Although CANOPA can simulate the observed vertical structure of water temperature and salinity, it tends to underestimate the cold intermediate layer and overestimate water salinity in the central Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL). In terms of the possible future climate, CANOPA simulations suggest that the GSL will be largely ice free in January, with ice volume in March steadily decreasing from about 80 km3 in the 1980s to near zero by the late 2060s. On average, the GSL water will become warmer and fresher over this time period. In January, maximum SST increases occur near eastern Cabot Strait, with amplitudes of about 1.5°–2.5°C, corresponding to reduced sea ice in that area, and there is no notable change along the western and northern coasts of the GSL. In July, maximum SST increases occur over the western GSL corresponding to the largest increases in surface air temperature in the region. The maximum decreases in surface salinity also occur near western coastal areas and the Scotian Shelf, whereas reductions in the eastern GSL are relatively weak.

Urban heat island (UHI) effects may further exacerbate the impacts of climate change on organisms that are sensitive to small changes in temperature. Currently, the Phoenix metropolitan region in Arizona, USA, is an average of 3 °C warmer than the surrounding desert. With continuing urbanization and climate change, thermal stress will become an increasingly important facet of urban ecology in coming decades. The main objective of our study was to investigate which landscaping styles and microhabitat variables can most effectively reduce the surface temperatures experienced by lizards. Using a bare lot as a control, we placed copper lizard models with data loggers in several vegetation and irrigation treatments that represent the dominant backyard landscaping styles in Phoenix (grassy mesic with mist irrigation, drip irrigated xeric, unirrigated native, and a hybrid style known as oasis). Our lizard models recorded 6915 estimates of potential body temperatures. We show that lizard activity time in summer was restricted to a few hours in un-irrigated native desert landscaping, while heavily irrigated grass and shade trees allowed for continual activity during even the hottest days. Shade, humidity, and sky view factor explained the majority of variation in temperature at a sub-meter scale.

A switch from crops and crop varieties currently grown to others that are better adapted to new environmental conditions has been suggested as one possible adaptation strategy. While research has documented the upward migration of wild species linked to recent warming in mountain environments, there has been little empirical research on corresponding shifts in the ranges of cultivated species. This study examines changes in the elevation of maize cultivation on the slopes of Mt. Cotacachi, a volcano located in the Northern Ecuadorian highlands. The results show that during the past two decades, farmers in four communities have expanded maize cultivation an estimated 200–300 m in elevation, linked to their observations of climatic and environmental change. This suggests that in tropical mountain regions like the Andes that exhibit closely stacked agroecological zones, the upward movement of local crops and crop varieties constitutes one feasible locally based adaptive response to changes in growing conditions induced by global warming. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","adaptation; Andes; climate change; crop shift; global warming; landraces; maize",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928248495

This study investigated the life cycle environmental assessment (LCA) of ME50 production from palm oil-diesel blends with ethanol and compared it with alternative biofuels, neat biodiesel (B100) and biodiesel-diesel blends (B50). Methods: The LCA system boundary was separated into five stages: the oil palm cultivation stage, the palm oil production stage, the microemulsion production stage, the transportation stage, and the exhaust emissions in the use stage. Ten potential environmental impacts of the ME50 were evaluated, namely, acidification, eutrophication, global warming, ozone layer depletion, human toxicity, aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, land use, water depletion, and fossil depletion, by combining the CML 2000, IPCC 2007, Ecoindicator 99, and ReCipe methods in SimaPro (v. 7.1). Further, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the microemulsion fuel production stage were calculated following the product carbon footprint (CFP) methodology. Results and discussion: It was estimated that 1.17 t or 45,800 MJ of microemulsion biofuel emits 3142 kg of CO<inf>2</inf>eq through its life cycle. Refined palm oil and co-surfactant are crucial materials for the environmental performance of the microemulsion-based biofuel. Based on the environmental impact analyses, palm oil production from cultivation through the oil refinery exhibited the greatest environmental impacts in terms of eutrophication and water depletion. Surfactant use—a key element in the microemulsion formation—has a significant impact on land use and ecotoxicity-related impact categories. In comparing the impacts among ME50, B100, and B50, it was found that microemulsion fuel production has lower environmental impact than B100 and B50, except in terms of land use and fossil depletion. Conclusions: Based on this analysis, the major environmental impact during the microemulsion biofuel production stage results from the raw materials used. The selection of appropriate materials and formula adjustment in the microemulsion fuel formulation are key in minimizing the potential impacts from biofuel production. Therefore, microemulsion biofuel is shown to be an environmentally sound technology for green production of biofuel. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Biodiesel; Diesel; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle assessment; Microemulsion biofuel; Surfactant",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928348236

Punjab, West Uttar Pradesh and East Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Gangetic West Bengal. IGPs are generally characterised by fertile soils, favourable climate and an abundant supply of water. They are considered as the ‘breadbasket’ for much of South Asia. The main source of rainfall is the southwest monsoon which is normally sufficient for agriculture. Based on observed available rainfall data, a time series of summer monsoon rainfall (SMR) (1871–2012) over the IGPs has been developed. Decadal and 30-year variability in SMR reveal alternate epochs of above and below normal rainfall. These epochs tend to last for a decade or two. Although small in magnitude, the long-term trend (1871–2012) in SMR shows a decreasing nature. On the other hand, the decadal variability in the SMR reveal a dominance of a positive phase in the past (during the period 1913–1922) and a negative phase during the recent decade (1993–2002). Recent climatology (1983–2012) shows a downward trend of the rainfall anomalies with the turning point around 1997 (associated with century’s strongest El-Nino, in 1997). The period before 1997 depicts subdued above normal rainfall, while the period after 1997 depicts below normal rainfall activity. Furthermore, the study reveals that SMR variability is enhanced during the El-Nino years and is suppressed during the La-Nina years, but the presence of El-Nino (La-Nina) does not guarantee droughts (floods) over the Gangetic plains. The spatiotemporal changes in rainfall activity are attributed to global warming and associated changes in the Indian summer monsoon circulations and the general atmospheric circulation. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","El-Nino/La-Nina; Indo-Gangetic plains; Summer monsoon rainfall; Teleconnection",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928345714

Interannual variation of ISV intensity is important for seasonal prediction of ISV impacts on severe weathers. Existing measures of overall tropical ISV intensity, however, do not show any significant simultaneous relationship with external sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs). In this study, it is proposed that the ISV intensity, represented by the seasonal standard deviation of the 30–90-day filtered outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), has a good relation with the external SSTAs. With this measure, two major components of the interannual variability of global ISV intensity are detected for both boreal summer and winter: EOF1 calls its variability over the central Pacific and EOF2 is associated with the variability over the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool region. More importantly, each of these two components is significantly related to SSTAs over a specific tropical region. The central Pacific ISV intensity is strong during central Pacific warming, while the ISV intensity is strong over the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool region during eastern Pacific cooling. The eastern and central Pacific warming has very different impacts on the ISV intensity: The eastern Pacific warming largely reduces the winter ISV intensity over the Indian Ocean, while the central Pacific warming only induces neutral winter ISV intensity anomalies over the Indian Ocean. In the summer, the ISV intensity variability is confined near the equator associated with the central Pacific warming; the eastern Pacific warming, however, induces large ISV intensity variability over the western North pacific because of strong northeastward propagation of the boreal summer ISV under the easterly vertical shear. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Wien",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928348794

Also, the connection between El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and precipitation extremes is analyzed and possible causes for the connection are briefly discussed. Results indicate that (1) warming, characterized by a decreasing trend in frost days and a significant decrease of temperature extremes defined by lower temperature, in the Poyang Lake basin is observed. Temperature extremes, defined by higher temperature indices such as hot days, exhibit moderate changes with no significant trends. Moreover, warming occurs mainly in the northern part of the Poyang Lake basin; (2) precipitation changes are intensifying as reflected by increasing precipitation extremes. However, these changes are different from 1 month to another and the intensification is found mainly in winter and/or summer months; (3) the influence of ENSO on precipitation changes in the Poyang Lake basin is evident with a time lag of longer than 3 months. This should be due to the fact that higher sea surface temperature tends to trigger the occurrence of convective precipitation regimes.

A field study was conducted to investigate the impact of soil warming (surface soil temperature increased by 1.3 °C) and nitrogen addition (100 kg N ha−1 year−1) on a desert steppe community in Inner Mongolia, China, from 2006 to 2011. Although there were strong intra- and inter-annual variations, in general, warming had little effect on coverage of the four major species (two cool season C<inf>3</inf> species: Convolvulusammannii and Stipa breviflora, and two warm season C<inf>4</inf> species: Cleistogenes songorica and Kochia prostrata) over six growing seasons. The C<inf>3</inf>/C<inf>4</inf> coverage ratio consistently decreased with warming, with the decrease being statistically significant for one-third of sampling dates. Warming caused a reduction (from 27.6 to 25.1 %) in peak season total plant community coverage. N addition did not affect the four main species, four functional groups (perennial grass, perennial forb, shrub and annual-biennial) or the total plant community over the 6 years, except when precipitation was high (231 mm in 2008). The small reduction in plant community coverage demonstrated the resilience of desert steppe to warming. There could be a shift of C<inf>3</inf> to C<inf>4</inf> species because of warming, as indicated by the decrease in C<inf>3</inf>/C<inf>4</inf> ratio, but confirmation of this trend requires further study. © 2015 The Ecological Society of Japan","Desert steppe ecosystem; Global warming; Grassland; Nitrogen application",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928136737

Developing new rice varieties with heat tolerance is an essential way to sustain rice production in future global warming. We have previously reported four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for rice spikelet fertility under high temperature at flowering stage from an IR64/N22 population. To further explore additional QTL from other varieties, two bi-parental F<inf>2</inf> populations and one three-way F<inf>2</inf> population derived from heat tolerant variety Giza178 were used for indentifying and confirming QTLs for heat tolerance at flowering stage. Results: Four QTLs (qHTSF1.2, qHTSF2.1, qHTSF3.1 and qHTSF4.1) were identified in the IR64/Giza178 population, and two other QTLs (qHTSF6.1 and qHTSF11.2) were identified in the Milyang23/Giza178 population. To confirm the identified QTLs, another three-way-cross population derived from IR64//Milyang23/Giza178 was genotyped using 6K SNP chips. Five QTLs were identified in the three-way-cross population, and three of those QTLs (qHTSF1.2, qHTSF4.1 and qHTSF6.1) were overlapped with the QTLs identified in the bi-parental populations. The tolerance alleles of these QTLs were from the tolerant parent Giza178 except for qHTSF3.1. The QTL on chromosome 4 (qHTSF4.1) is the same QTL previously identified in the IR64/N22 population. Conclusion: The results from different populations suggest that heat tolerance in rice at flowering stage is controlled by several QTLs with small effects and stronger heat tolerance could be attained through pyramiding validated heat tolerance QTLs. QTL qHTSF4.1 was consistently detected across different genetic backgrounds and could be an important source for enhancing heat tolerance in rice at flowering stage. Polymorphic SNP markers in these QTL regions can be used for future fine mapping and developing SNP chips for marker-assisted breeding. © Ye et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Global warming; Heat stress; Quantitative trait locus; Rice; Spikelet fertility","Jansen, E., Overpeck, J., Briffa, K.R., Duplessy, J.-C., Joos, F., Masson-Delmotte, V., Olago, D., Rahmstorf, S., Palaeoclimate (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.

The method relies on geographically differentiated estimates of radiative forcing from albedo change associated with major land cover transitions derived from the Community Earth System Model. We find that conversion of 1 km2 of woody vegetation (forest and shrublands) to non-woody vegetation (crops and grassland) yields between 0 and −0.71 nW/m2 of globally averaged radiative forcing determined by the vegetation characteristics, snow dynamics, and atmospheric radiation environment characteristic within each of 151 regions we consider globally. Across a set of scenarios designed to span a range of potential future LULCC, we find LULCC forcing ranging from −0.06 to −0.29 W/m2 by 2070 depending on assumptions regarding future crop yield growth and whether climate policy favors afforestation or bioenergy crops. Inclusion of this previously uncounted forcing in the policy targets driving future climate mitigation efforts leads to changes in fossil fuel emissions on the order of 1.5 PgC/yr by 2070 for a climate forcing limit of 4.5 Wm−2, corresponding to a 12–67 % change in fossil fuel emissions depending on the scenario. Scenarios with significant afforestation must compensate for albedo-induced warming through additional emissions reductions, and scenarios with significant deforestation need not mitigate as aggressively due to albedo-induced cooling. In all scenarios considered, inclusion of albedo forcing in policy targets increases forest and shrub cover globally. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA)",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928155128

To clarify this, we perform content analysis of 1350 testimonies from congressional GWCC hearings over a period of 39 years from 1969 to 2007 and use the data derived from this content analysis to provide an overview of scientist witnesses’ stances on GWCC. The key findings include: (1) among the scientists’ testimonies with an expressed view on whether GWCC is real, a vast majority (86 %) indicates that it is happening; (2) among the scientists’ testimonies with an identified stance on whether GWCC is anthropogenic, a great majority of them (78 %) indicates that GWCC is caused, at least to some degree, by human activity; (3) even under Republican controlled congresses, there is still a supermajority (75 %) - among the scientists’ testimonies with an expressed position on GWCC existence or GWCC cause - that believes that GWCC is real and that GWCC is anthropogenic; (4) most scientists’ testimonies (95 %) endorse pro-action policy to combat GWCC; and (5) the percentages of scientists’ views and positions are consistent across different types of scientist testimony groups. Our findings suggest that the scientific information transmitted to Congress is not substantially different from the general agreement in the climate science community. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928136828

For a given global warming signal produced by a climate model ensemble, there exists an envelope of GMT values representing the range of possible unforced states of the climate system (the Envelope of Unforced Noise; EUN). Typically, the EUN is derived from climate models themselves, but climate models might not accurately simulate the correct characteristics of unforced GMT variability. Here, we simulate a new, empirical, EUN that is based on instrumental and reconstructed surface temperature records. We compare the forced GMT signal produced by climate models to observations while noting the range of GMT values provided by the empirical EUN. We find that the empirical EUN is wide enough so that the interdecadal variability in the rate of global warming over the 20 th century does not necessarily require corresponding variability in the rate-of-increase of the forced signal. The empirical EUN also indicates that the reduced GMT warming over the past decade or so is still consistent with a middle emission scenario's forced signal, but is likely inconsistent with the steepest emission scenario's forced signal.",,"Bindoff, N.L., Detection and attribution of climate change: From global to regional (2013) Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis.

Its impacts and costs will be large, serious, and unevenly spread, globally for decades. The main factor causing climate change and global warming is the increase of global carbon emissions produced by human activities such as deforestation and burning of fossil fuels. In this special volume, the articles mainly focus on investigations of technical innovations and policy interventions for improved energy efficiency and carbon emissions reduction in a wide diversity of industrial, construction and agricultural sectors at different scales, from the smallest scales (firm or household), cities, regional, to national and global scales. Some articles in this special volume assess alternative carbon emissions reduction approaches, such as carbon capture and storage and geoengineering schemes. Given the high cost and internal/external uncertainties of carbon capture and storage and risks and side effects of various geoengineering schemes, improved energy efficiency and widespread implementation of low fossil-carbon renewable-energy based systems are clearly the most direct and effective approaches to reduce carbon emissions. This means that we have to radically transform our societal metabolism towards low/no fossil-carbon economies. However, design and implementation of low/no fossil-carbon production will require fundamental changes in the design, production and use of products and these needed changes are evolving but much more needs to be done. Additionally, the design and timing of suitable climate policy interventions, such as various carbon taxation/trading schemes, must be integral in facilitating the development of low fossil carbon products and accelerating the transition to post-fossil carbon societies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage; Carbon emissions reduction; Carbon trade/tax schemes; Geoengineering approaches; Implementation of low-fossil carbon energy systems; Improved energy use efficiency",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928902445

Thus, optimizing the energy efficiency of wireless communications not only reduces environmental impact, but also cuts overall network costs and helps make communication more practical and affordable in a pervasive setting. This paper is focused on a solution to enhance the energy efficiency in outdoor wireless local area networks using the standard IEEE 802.11b/g. So, from a previous study about the weather’s impact on the number of control frame errors and retransmissions, we propose a green cognitive algorithm that adapts wireless transmissions to the channel conditions caused by the weather. The goal is to reduce retransmissions and control errors in order to save energy and to enhance network performance. Our proposal is based on a mathematical analysis in which we see how the frame error rate is related to the power consumption according to the modulation scheme and data rate used by transmitters. Finally, several simulations show that the green cognitive algorithm presented in this paper involves significant energy savings for outdoors WLANs. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Energy efficiency; Green cognitive algorithm; IEEE 802.11; MAC layer; Outdoor WLAN; Weather’s impact",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928136650

Besides, different consumer behaviors can result in quite different environmental consequences mainly in terms of water and energy consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically evaluate the environmental impacts of textiles from a life cycle perspective to improve the sustainability of textiles especially for China, the biggest producer, exporter, and consumer in the world. Methods: This study is conducted according to the International Organizations for Standardization’s (ISO) 14040 standard series. The declared unit is a piece of 100 % cotton short-sleeved T-shirt. The production data mainly come from field investigations of representative mills in China. The use-phase data are mainly from 924 questionnaires of Chinese residents. The secondary data from databases, literatures, and authoritative statistical data are supplemented in case primary data are not available. The potential environmental impacts are evaluated using the CML2001 and USEtox methodologies built into the GaBi version 6.0 software. We determine hotspots throughout the life cycle of the cotton textile considering the impact categories of abiotic depletion, acidification potential, global warming potential, photochemical ozone creation potential, eutrophication potential, water use, and toxicity. Results and discussion: The results of the study show that cotton cultivation, dyeing, making-up, and use-phases are the main contributors to the environmental impacts. In particular, fertilizer, pesticide, and water use in cotton cultivation, coal, dyes, and auxiliaries use in dyeing, electricity use in making-up, detergent and water use in washing, and electricity use in spinning are the hotspots based on the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results. The use-phase scenario analysis shows that compared with machine washing, electric drying, and ironing share the majority of electricity consumption. Compared with Americans, Chinese washing habits are much more environmental-friendly and bring much lower environmental impacts in the use stage. Conclusions: Energy consumption, chemical use, and water use are main contributors to most impact categories, which help us to find hotspots and potential improvements of sustainability. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Cleaner production; Clothing; Consumer behavior; Cotton textile; Environmental management; Laundry washing; Life cycle assessment; Sustainability",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928137836

While fungi have been identified as a putative source of N 2 O, little is known about their production of this greenhouse gas. Here we investigated the N 2 O-producing ability of a collection of 207 fungal isolates. Seventy strains producing N 2 O in pure culture were identified. They were mostly species from the order Hypocreales order - particularly Fusarium oxysporum and Trichoderma spp. - and to a lesser extent species from the orders Eurotiales, Sordariales, and Chaetosphaeriales. The N 2 O 15 N site preference (SP) values of the fungal strains ranged from 15.8‰ to 36.7‰, and we observed a significant taxa effect, with Penicillium strains displaying lower SP values than the other fungal genera. Inoculation of 15 N 2 O-producing strains into pre-sterilized arable, forest and grassland soils confirmed the ability of the strains to produce N 2 O in soil with a significant strain-by-soil effect. The copper-containing nitrite reductase gene (nirK) was amplified from 45 N 2 O-producing strains, and its genetic variability showed a strong congruence with the ITS phylogeny, indicating vertical inheritance of this trait. Taken together, this comprehensive set of findings should enhance our knowledge of fungi as a source of N 2 O in the environment.",,"Davidson, E.A., Rogers, J., Whitman, W., Fluxes of nitrous oxide and nitric oxide from terrestrial ecosystems (1991) Microbial Production and Consumption of Greenhouse Gases: Methane, Nitrogen Oxides and Halomethanes., pp. 219-235. , (eds.

This process will reduce energy consumption and minimize carbon dioxide emissions. Having investigated the hydrogen reduction kinetics of magnetite and hematite concentrate particles relevant to the novel flash ironmaking process, the carbon monoxide reduction kinetics of hematite concentrate particles (average particle size 21 µm) was determined in the temperature range 1473 K to 1623 K (1200 °C to 1350 °C) under various carbon monoxide partial pressures. At 1623 K (1350 °C) and residence time 5 seconds, the reduction degree of hematite concentrate particles was more than 90 pct under a pure carbon monoxide. This is slower than reduction by hydrogen but still significant, indicating that CO will contribute to the reduction of hematite concentrate in the flash process. The kinetics of CO reduction separately from hydrogen is important for understanding and analyzing the complex kinetics of hematite reduction by the H<inf>2</inf> + CO mixtures. The nucleation and growth rate equation with the Avrami parameter n = 1.0 adequately described the carbon monoxide reduction kinetics of hematite concentrate particles. The reduction rate is of 1st order with respect to the partial pressure of carbon monoxide and the activation energy of the reaction was 231 kJ/mol, indicating strong temperature dependence. The following complete rate equation was developed that can satisfactorily predict the carbon monoxide reduction kinetics of hematite concentrate particles and is suitable for the design of a flash reactor (Formula presented.) where X is the fraction of oxygen removed from iron oxide, R is 8.314 J/mol K, T is in K, p is in atm, and t is in seconds. © 2015 The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928153112
