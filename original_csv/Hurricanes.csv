However, there is limited empirical examination from the user perspective of the functions that social media play and the factors that explain such uses. In this study we examine Twitter use during and after Typhoon Haiyan pummeled the Philippines. We tested a typology of Twitter use based on previous research, and explored external factors - time of use and geographic location - and internal factors - type of stakeholders (e.g. ordinary citizens, journalists, etc.) and social media engagement - to predict these uses. The results showed that different stakeholders used social media mostly for dissemination of second-hand information, in coordinating relief efforts, and in memorializing those affected. Recommendations for future research and applications in future crises are also presented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Content analysis; Crisis; Natural disasters; Social media; Twitter","Acar, A., Muraki, Y., Twitter for crisis communication: Lessons learned from Japan's tsunami disaster (2011) International Journal of Web Based Communities, 7 (3), pp. 392-402; Beneito-Montagut, R., Anson, S., Shaw, D., Brewster, C., Governmental social media use for emergency communication (2013) Paper Presented at the Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management, , Baden-Baden, Germany; Binder, A.R., Figuring out# Fukushima: An initial look at functions and content of US Twitter commentary about nuclear risk (2012) Environmental Communication: A Journal of Nature and Culture, 6 (2), pp. 268-277; Bird, D., Ling, M., Haynes, K., Flooding Facebook-the use of social media during the Queensland and Victorian floods (2012) Australian Journal of Emergency Management, the, 27 (1), p. 27; Black, J., (2013) Mixed News, , public/civic/communitarianjournalismdebate:Routledge; Borden, S.L., Communitarian journalism and the common good: Lessons from the Catholic Worker (2014) Journalism, 15 (3), pp. 273-288; Bruns, A., Faster than the speed of print: Reconciling 'big data' social media analysis and academic scholarship (2013) First Monday, 18 (10); Bruns, A., Burgess, J., Crisis communication in natural disasters: The Queensland floods and Christchurch earthquakes (2013) Twitter and Society, 89, pp. 373-384. , K.

In response, concentrations of suspended sediments and a range of trace organic pollutants were intensively measured in dry weather and storm flow runoff from a 100% urban watershed. Flow in this highly urban watershed responded very quickly to rainfall and varied widely resulting in rapid changes of turbidity, suspended sediments and pollutant concentrations. Concentrations of each organic pollutant class were within similar ranges reported in other studies of urban runoff, however comparison was limited for several of the pollutants given information scarcity. Consistently among PCBs, PBDEs, and PAHs, the more hydrophobic congeners were transported in larger proportions during storm flows relative to low flows. Loads for Water Years 2007-2010 were estimated using regression with turbidity during the monitored months and a flow weighted mean concentration for unmonitored dry season months. More than 91% of the loads for every pollutant measured were transported during storm events, along with 87% of the total discharge. While this dataset fills an important local data gap for highly urban watersheds of San Francisco Bay, the methods, the uniqueness of the analyte list, and the resulting interpretations have applicability for managing pollutant loads in urban watersheds in other parts of the world. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Arid climate; Management implications; Organic pollutants; Stormwater runoff; Urban land use","Brander, S.M., Fojut, T.L., Palumbo, A.J., Tjeerdema, R.S., Water quality criteria report for bifenthrin.

Tropical cyclone impacts on wetland, terrestrial, and shelf systems have been previously studied and reasonably delineated, but little is known about the response of coastal lakes to storm events. This initial investigation of tropical cyclone impacts on a shallow coastal lake clarifies sediment transport and deposition patterns in a geologically complex deltaic region. Modeling results from Hurricane Rita forcing conditions hindcast a maximum storm surge elevation of approximately 1.1m and a significant wave height of 1.0m in Sister Lake. Bed shear stresses across almost the entire model domain leading up to Hurricane Rita's landfall were above the critical value causing erosion of fine-grained bottom sediments, and quickly decreased in the western portion during Rita's landfall, indicating significant deposition in this western portion of the lake. The ideal event sedimentation unit that would result from the storm conditions hindcast from the numerical model was corroborated with stratigraphy identified in box cores; sedimentary units with an erosional base overlain by recently deposited silty material topped by clays. This study provides a fundamental understanding of lake bottom characteristics and impacts of storm-related physical processes on erosion and deposition. © 2015.","Hydrodynamics; Mississippi River Delta Plain; Modeling; Storm surge; Suspended sediment; Tropical cyclones","Ali, A., Zhang, H., Lemckert, C.J., Numerical study of the hydrodynamics of a very shallow estuarine system-Coombabah Lake, Gold Coast, Australia (2009) J.Coast.

There is growing interest in the U.S., as well as around the world, to use natural infrastructure to help coastal communities become more resilient to extreme events and reduce the risk of coastal flooding. Here we highlight strengths and weaknesses of the coastal protection benefits provided by built infrastructure, natural ecosystems, and the innovative opportunities to combine the two into hybrid approaches for coastal protection. We also examine some case studies where hybrid approaches are being implemented to improve coastal resilience as well as some of the policy challenges that can make implementation of these approaches more difficult. The case studies we examine are largely in the U.S. but also include a couple of international examples as well. Based on this analysis, we conclude that coastal communities and other decision makers need better information in order to incorporate ecosystem protection and restoration into coastal resilience planning efforts. As additional projects are developed, it is important to capitalize on every opportunity to learn more about the cost of natural and hybrid infrastructure projects, the value of the storm and erosion protection benefits provided, and the full suite of co-benefits provided by healthy coastal ecosystems. We highlight top priorities for research, investment in, and application of natural and hybrid approaches. These data are critical to facilitate adoption of these approaches in planning and decision-making at all levels to enhance the resilience of our coasts. © 2015.","Coastal flooding; Community resilience; Ecosystem services; Storm protection; Storm surge","(2013) Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, p. 47. , 113th Congress of the United States of America; Aiken, C., Chase, N., Hellendrung, J., Wormser, J., (2014) Designing with Water, Preparing for the Rising Tide, , Boston Harbor Association, Boston, MA; Arkema, K.K., Guannel, G., Verutes, G., Wood, S.A., Guerry, A., Ruckelshaus, M., Kareiva, P., Silver, J.M., Coastal habitats shield people and property from sea-level rise and storms (2013) Nat.

Mobility events, defined as seafloor wave stress exceedance of the critical stress of 0.35. mm diameter sand (0.2160. Pa) for 12 or more hours, were identified from surface wave observations at National Data Buoy Center buoys in the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) and South Atlantic Bight (SAB) over the period of 1997-2007. In water depths ranging from 36-48. m, there were 4-9 mobility events/year of 1-2 days duration. Integrated wave stress during events (IWAVES) was used as a combined metric of wave-driven mobility intensity and duration. In the MAB, over 67% of IWAVES was caused by extratropical storms, while in the SAB, greater than 66% of IWAVES was caused by tropical storms. On average, mobility events were caused by waves generated by storms located 800+. km away. Far-field hurricanes generated swell 2-4 days before the waves caused mobility on the shelf. Throughout most of the SAB, mobility events were driven by storms to the south, east, and west. In the MAB and near Cape Hatteras, winds from more northerly storms and low-pressure extratropical systems in the mid-western U.S. also drove mobility events. Waves generated by storms off the SAB generated mobility events along the entire U.S. East Coast shelf north to Cape Cod, while Cape Hatteras shielded the SAB area from swell originating to the north offshore of the MAB. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Bottom wave stress; Extratropical storms; Seafloor mobility; Tropical storms; U.S. East Coast continental shelf","Airy, G.B., Tides and waves, Section 392 (1845) Encycopedia Metropolitana, 5, pp. 241-396; Ardhuin, F., Drake, T.G., Herbers, T.H.C., Observations of wave-generated vortex ripples on the North Carolina continental shelf (2002) J.

The simulated volume transport by the western boundary current system in the IAS, including the Caribbean Current, Yucatan Current and Loop Current (LC), is reduced by 20-25% during the 21st century, consistent with a similar rate of reduction in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The effect of the LC in the present climate is to warm the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Therefore, the reduced LC and the associated weakening of the warm transient LC eddies have a cooling impact in the GoM, particularly during boreal spring in the northern deep basin, in agreement with an earlier dynamic downscaling study. In contrast to the reduced warming in the northern deep GoM, the downscaled model predicts an intense warming in the shallow (≤. 200. m) northeastern shelf of the GoM especially during boreal summer since there is no effective mechanism to dissipate the increased surface heating. Potential implications of the regionally distinctive warming trend pattern in the GoM on the marine ecosystems and hurricane intensifications during landfall are discussed. This study also explores the effects of 20th century warming and climate variability in the IAS using the regional ocean model forced with observed surface flux fields. The main modes of sea surface temperature variability in the IAS are linked to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and a meridional dipole pattern between the GoM and Caribbean Sea. It is also shown that variability of the IAS western boundary current system in the 20th century is largely driven by wind stress curl in the Sverdrup interior and the AMOC. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","AMO; AMOC; Caribbean current; Caribbean Sea; Climate change; Dynamical downscaling; Global warming; Gulf of Mexico; Intra-Americas Sea; Loop current","Alexander, M., Scott, J., The influence of ENSO on air-sea interaction in the Atlantic (2002) Geophys.

In this paper, the dynamic road risk for pedestrian evacuation in a densely populated area of Beijing was studied with consideration of different influencing factors. Firstly, the eight influencing factors including road width, node degree, safety betweenness, road resistor coefficient, building threat, pedestrian counterflow, illegal vehicle parking and traffic flow were considered to assess the road risk for pedestrian evacuation. Secondly, based on complex network theory, electric circuit theory and real situation of the roads, the comprehensive assessment function for road risk was developed quantitatively based on the eight influencing factors. Thirdly, we analyzed road risk for pedestrian evacuation considering different situations: current condition, regular condition, and optimal condition; the risk distribution maps were drawn to directly show the risk level. Through assessments, the roads with high risk for pedestrian evacuation were found, and an optimized evacuation plan was obtained and analyzed. This mathematical model can guide the emergency evacuation in real time. The process and the results are essential for improving the efficiency of evacuations which should considerably reduce the possibility of injuries, deaths and other losses in the disaster. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Complex network; Disaster; Pedestrian evacuation; Risk analysis; Road risk","Hoogendoorn, S.P., Van Wageningen-Kessels, F.L.M., Daamen, W., Duives, D.C., Continuum modelling of pedestrian flows: From microscopic principles to self-organised macroscopic phenomena (2014) Physica A, 416, pp. 684-694; Bohannon, J., Directing the herd: Crowds and the science of evacuation (2005) Science, 310, pp. 219-221; Horner, M.W., Widener, M.J., The effects of transportation network failure on people's accessibility to hurricane disaster relief goods: A modeling approach and application to a Florida case study (2011) Nat.

Simultaneous departures of evacuees can lead to overloading of road networks causing congestion. We are especially interested in cases when evacuees subject to little or no risk of exposure evacuate along with evacuees subject to higher risk of threat (also known as shadow evacuation). One of the reasons for correlated evacuee departures is higher perceived risk of threat spread through social contacts. In this work, we study an evacuation scenario consisting of a high risk region and a surrounding low risk area. We propose a probabilistic evacuee departure time model incorporating both evacuee individual characteristics and the underlying evacuee social network. We find that the performance of an evacuation process can be improved by forcing a small subset of evacuees (inhibitors) in the low risk area to delay their departure. The performance of an evacuation is measured by both average travel time of the population and total evacuation time of the high risk evacuees. We derive closed form expressions for average travel time for ER random network. A detailed experimental analysis of various inhibitor selection strategies and their effectiveness on different social network topologies and risk distribution is performed. Results indicate that significant improvement in evacuation performance can be achieved in scenarios where evacuee social networks have short average path lengths and topologically influential evacuees do not belong to the high risk regions. Additionally, communities with stronger ties improve evacuation performance. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Congestion; Departure time choice Models; Diffusion; Evacuation; Shadow evacuation; Social networks","Alsnih, R., Stopher, P., Review of procedures associated with devising emergency evacuation plans (2004) Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 1865 (1), pp. 89-97;

The experimental parameters tested cover a wide range of wave and inundation conditions that may occur during a major storm or hurricane. This includes a wave matrix of 40 waves and bridge model elevations covering a range where the top of the bridge is fully submerged below the still-water level (SWL) to where the bottom of the girders are elevated above the SWL. Measurements for surface elevation, vertical and horizontal forces are compared with calculations made by solving Euler's equations using the CFD software OpenFOAM with good agreement. Vertical uplift and horizontal positive forces (forces measured in the direction of wave propagation) are compared with the simplified equations using the relations given in Douglass et al. (2006). This set of data provides a valuable benchmark for understanding wave loads on coastal bridges during a storm or hurricane. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Bridge deck; Cnoidal wave forces; Coastal; Laboratory experiments; OpenFOAM","Robertson, I.N., Yim, S., Riggs, H.R., Young, Y.L., Coastal bridge performance during Hurricane Katrina (2007) Proceedings of the International Conference on Structural Engineering, Mechanics and Computation, Cape Town, South Africa, pp. 1864-1870. , Milpress The Netherlands; Xiao, H., Huang, W., Chen, Q., Effects of submersion depth on wave uplift force acting on Biloxi bay bridge decks during hurricane Katrina (2010) Comput. & Fluids, 39, pp. 1390-1400; Hayatdavoodi, M., (2013) Nonlinear Wave Loads on Decks of Coastal Structures, p. xiv+186. , (Ph.D. thesis) University of Hawaii at Manoa December; Hayatdavoodi, M., Ertekin, R.C., Wave forces on a submerged horizontal plate.

Prior research, mainly confined to studying rural communities and fairly large geographic areas, has demonstrated that civic communities have lower rates of violence. The current study analyzes the associations between the components of civic communities and homicide rates for New Orleans neighborhoods (census tracts) in the years following Hurricane Katrina. Results from negative binomial regression models adjusting for spatial autocorrelation reveal that community homicide rates are lower where an entrepreneurial business climate is more pronounced and where there is more local investment. Additionally, an interaction between the availability of civic institutions and resource disadvantage reveals that the protective effects of civic institutions are only evident in disadvantaged communities. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Civic communities; Civic institutions; Homicide; Local capitalism; Local investment","Anselin, L., (1988) Spatial Econometrics: Methods and Models, , Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA; Baller, R.D., Anselin, L., Messner, S.F., Deane, G., Hawkins, D.F., Structural covariates of U.S. county homicide rates: incorporating spatial effects (2001) Criminology, 39, pp. 561-590; Baumer, E.P., Wolff, K.T., Arnio, A.N., A multicity neighborhood analysis of foreclosure and crime (2012) Soc.

This study examined the experiences of a faculty response team from one counselor education program, focusing on academic and counselor role expectations and perceived professional implications. We conducted interviews with all eight faculty members in one program and analyzed data using constant comparative and discourse analyses. The dialectic of chaos/order, central to all narratives, was expressed as trying/doing, insider/outsider, visibility/invisibility, and leaving/staying.

In order to overcome a limitation of conventional fragility models where the performance of the roof cover is assumed to be fixed, we propose a new framework for obtaining the fragility of roof covers under high winds. The approach models the capacity related terms as functions rather than fixed values. Therefore, it can describe gradual increase of failure probability as the roof cover degrades over time. The parameters for the capacity functions are obtained from sensor measurements. In order to overcome the uncertainties associated with the limited measurements, a Bayesian approach is employed. Although the proposed framework can be applied to any type of roof covers, an illustrative example is given for asphalt shingles. Results show the importance of considering degradation of the roof cover in obtaining the fragility. The proposed approach provides much more comprehensive fragility functions than conventional approaches by considering the degradation of the roof cover. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies suggest that a substantial amount of particulate OC (POC) might escape from the shelf and be exported to the continental slope-deep sea sector, although the mechanisms and magnitude of such deep sea POC transfer remain unknown. Here we investigate hyperpycnal flow-associated total suspended matter (TSM) collected from water depths of ~3000m, near the bottom of sea floor, in the Gaoping Submarine Canyon (GSC) off southwestern Taiwan. Elemental (C, N), isotopic (δ13C, δ15N) and biomarker compositions of TSM were investigated to understand its biogeochemical characteristics. A two end-member δ13C mixing model indicates that deep sea TSM contains ~90% terrigenous OC, while a similar mixing model using δ15N reveals a lower proportion (~58%). Organic biomarkers of TSM suggest contributions from a mixture of resuspended, continental-margin derived marine organic matter (OM<inf>MAR</inf>) and terrigenous sources, revealing that terrestrial OC likely mixes with nitrogen-rich marine material during rapid transport. This study documents that rapid transfer of terrigenous organic matter (OM<inf>TERR</inf>) into the deeper regions of GSC occurred within a week of typhoon Morakot, likely through hyperpycnal injection of sediment-laden, warm freshwater from southern Taiwan. Evidence from this typhoon Morakot-induced hyperpycnal plume event in Taiwan demonstrates that extreme storm events provide an efficient way to export terrigenous OC without oxidation to hitherto unknown water depths of deep sea in the Oceania region. © 2015 .","Deep sea export; Gaoping submarine canyon; Organic carbon; Particulate matter; Storm events; SW Taiwan","Abelson, P.H., Parker, P.L., Hoering, T.C., Fatty acids in sedimentary rocks (1962) Science, 136, p. 324; Bauer, J.E., Druffel, E.R.M., Ocean margins as a significant source of organic matter to the deep ocean (1998) Nature, 392, pp. 482-485; Benthien, A., Müller, P.J., Anomalously low alkenone temperatures caused by lateral particle and sediment transport in the Malvinas Current region, western Argentine Basin (2000) Deep-Sea Res.

The sensitivity experiments are carried out with three convective parameterization schemes, and the results are evaluated based on the track and intensity of cyclones. The Betts-Miller-Janjic scheme shows the most reasonable representation of track and intensity and therefore is used for all sensitivity experiments related to microphysical schemes in two and three domains. Three sets of microphysics sensitivity experiments are carried out: The first set includes experiments with parameterized moist convection (referred to as the 9-km experiment) in two domains (27 and 9 km). The second and third sets of simulation experiments are carried out at 9 km in two domains (27 and 9 km; referred to as the 9-km-noCP) and at 3 km in three domains (27 km, 9 km and 3 km; referred to as the 3-km experiment), respectively, by resolving the grid-scale convection explicitly with the four bulk microphysical schemes. The explicit moist convection treatment at 9- and 3-km resolution produces a better cyclone simulation than the parameterized convection at 9-km resolution. The latent heat released in the generation of hydrometeors such as snow and graupel in the mid-tropospheric levels appears to influence the heating within the inner core of the cyclone. The comparable and more realistic representation of mid-tropospheric heating is possibly one of the main reasons behind the improvement at 9-km-noCP and 3 km. The stronger vertical advection of moist static energy gives well-organized mesoscale convection within the cyclone environment at 9-km-noCP and 3-km resolution. This study therefore demonstrates the importance of microphysical processes in the simulation of weaker TC over the North Indian Ocean. © 2014, Springer Basel.","Moist convection; Weaker cyclones; WRF-ARW","Abhik, S., Halder, M., Mukhopadhyay, P., Jiang J., Goswami B.N.

The pollution load in catchments affected by this increased population density far exceeds the self-purifying ability of the catchments. Land use changes in such river basins have affected the hydrological environment, as seen in diminished water quality not only in rivers but also in groundwater and springs, resulting in a decline in the available water resources. In particular, river water, which has different characteristics in urban and rural regions, must be considered, as the increased environmental impacts of changes in land use and human activities can create problems for society. Thus, following the adoption of a land use regulation system based on land use planning, the balance between the importance of conservation and the impact of human activities such as industrial production, agricultural production, and human waste is an important issue. In this study, using a catchment simulator model, we assessed the effectiveness of environmental management practices that incorporated the effects of alterations in land use, which were determined quantitatively from a catchment management perspective to solve environmental improvement problems based on land use and human activities in Tokyo (urban) and Hokkaido (rural). The results of this study are of use to stakeholders with an interest in the maintenance of social capital with an advanced urban function in the development of rural areas. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Compresence; Environmental context; Human activity; Land cover; Rehabilitation","Abler, D., Shortle, J., Carmichel, J., Horan, R., Climate change, agriculture and water quality in the Chesapeake Bay region (2002) Clim.

A spring PM<inf>2.5</inf> monitoring network was operated to study the long-range transport of PM<inf>2.5</inf> in five cities along the pathway of dust storm across Northern and Eastern China in spring 2004.PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations gradually decreased, but PM<inf>2.5</inf> pollution still retained a high level and hasbeen changed from dust type to haze-fog pollution at Beijing in the past decade. The seasonal variation of PM<inf>2.5</inf> was spring>winter>autumn>summer during 2002-2004, but winter>autumn>summer>spring in 2011-2013. The mass concentration of mineral aerosol was in the order of spring>winter>summer>autumn, and reached the highest level in dust storm episodes during the past decade. Secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) followed the order of summer>autumn>winter>spring during 2002-2004, however winter>autumn>summer>spring during 2011-2013, and reached the highest level in haze events. The concentrations of SO<inf>4</inf>2-, NO<inf>3</inf>- and NH<inf>4</inf>+ of SIA displayed the order of SO<inf>4</inf>2->NO<inf>3</inf>->NH<inf>4</inf>+ in haze days. SO<inf>4</inf>2- concentrations in different seasons during 2011-2013 were almost lower than those in corresponding period in 2002-2004 respectively. But NO<inf>3</inf>- and NH<inf>4</inf>+ concentrations in autumn and winter of 2011-2013 were higher than those in 2002-2004. The OA and SOA concentrations followed the order of winter>autumn>summer and spring, and SOA was one of the significant components in OA. The secondary chemical transformation was the most significant source for PM<inf>2.5</inf> during 2011-2013, compared with that in 2002-2004. Atmospheric pollution has exhibited severe complicated pollution. Dust storm carried not only large amounts of mineral dust, but also some secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) and organic aerosol (OA), which would have significant impact on the wide downwind areas. The mass fraction of mineral aerosol decreased from the dust source to the downwind coastal sites, while those of secondary and carbonaceous components increased. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Mineral aerosol; Organic aerosol; PM<inf>2.5</inf>; Seasonal variation; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Spatial distribution","Cao, J.J., Lee, S.C., Zheng, X.D., Ho, K.F., Zhang, X.Y., Guo, H., Chow, J.C., Wang, H.B., Characterization of dust storms to Hong Kong in April 1998 (2003) Water, Air, Soil Pollut.

Additionally, nocturnal mesopause temperature measurements with a temporal resolution of about 1. min were conducted by the infrared (IR)- Ground-based Infrared P-branch Spectrometer (GRIPS) during the campaign period.Strongly enhanced gravity wave activity in the lower stratosphere is observed which can be attributed to a hurricane-like storm (so-called Medicane) and to passing by cold fronts. Statistical features of gravity wave parameters including energy densitiy and momentum fluxes are calculated. Gravity wave momentum fluxes turned out being up to five times larger during severe weather. Moreover, gravity wave horizontal propagation characteristics are derived applying hodograph and Stokes parameter analysis.

Diatoms are abundant and diverse in estuaries, and may characterize these dynamics across relevant time scales. The climate of south Florida is subtropical, with dry winters and wet summers that may also harbor tropical storms and cyclones. We investigated whether these repeated seasonal drivers of change in estuaries differ from the influence of tropical cyclones on planktonic and benthic diatom assemblages. Diatom assemblages and environmental parameters were measured in the Charlotte Harbor watershed of southwest Florida to identify differences between the wet and dry seasons and changes that occurred following Tropical Storm Debby in 2012. Indicator taxa that were significantly affiliated with each season and post-storm conditions were identified. Diatom assemblages across the watershed were similar in wet and dry seasons, but differences increased following the tropical storm. The reduction in community dispersion following the storm was pronounced in each of the major drainages of the estuary. There were spatially-distinct responses of diatoms to environmental changes driven by the storm. These results suggest that past storm activity could be detected using diatoms preserved in estuarine sediments using both single indicator-species as well as community approaches. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However intriguing paradigms on the role of large scale SST variations on continental US including SeUS droughts and seasonal Atlantic tropical cyclone activity confronts us. These paradigms suggest that in the presence of warm (cold) eastern tropical Pacific and cold (warm) Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) lead to the increased likelihood of wetter (drier) conditions over the continental US including the SeUS. Juxtaposing this understanding with the fact that landfalling tropical cyclones contribute significantly to the annual mean total rainfall in the SeUS and in El Niño (La Niña) years with cold (warm) tropical Atlantic SSTA lead to reduced (increased) Atlantic tropical cyclone activity raises a conflict on the role of the large-scale SST variations in SeUS hydroclimate. This study attempts to investigate the apparent dichotomous role of the large scale SST variations on the SeUS hydrology by examining the role of rainfall from landfalling tropical cyclones in the SeUS to local seasonal droughts. Our study finds that the contribution of the rainfall from landfalling tropical cyclone on the mitigation of monthly drought in the 28 SeUS watersheds is relatively insignificant. So much so that the hydrological model uncertainty in estimating the drought index over the 28 SeUS watersheds is larger than the sensitivity exhibited by the drought index to the inclusion of rain from landfalling tropical cyclone. The conclusions of this study are justified by the fact that the timing of the landfalling tropical cyclone in relation to overall soil moisture conditions of the watershed does not coincide with a drought like situation in the 1948–2006 time period analyzed in this study. This largely stems from the fact that the large-scale flow pattern resulting in abundant (lack of) advection of moisture for anomalously wet (dry) summer and fall seasons in the SeUS emanating from the source region of the Caribbean Sea and the northwestern tropical Atlantic Ocean coincides with the steering flow of the Atlantic tropical cyclones bound to make landfall in the SeUS (recurving away from the SeUS). © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Atlantic hurricanes; Droughts; Hydrology; Teleconnection",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929440202

TCs at higher categories contribute much more to the total precipitation. (2) On monthly scale, TCs contribute 60% to the total rainfall regionally during whole TC season, which is the maximum contribution.

However, the development of a useful metric for vulnerability and resilience assessment has a lot of challenges. Cartography and GIS analysis can contribute effectively to the solution of the issue by integrating natural and human data layers for assessment, mapping, and visualization. This paper uses the new Resilience Inference Measurement (RIM) model to assess the resilience of 25 countries in the Caribbean region to hurricanes. The RIM indices of the countries were computed using three variables representing three dimensions: exposure, damage, and recovery, and eight variables representing social-environmental capacity. The RIM resilience indices were mapped and compared with the vulnerability indices computed in a previous study. The results show that Turks & Caicos Islands had the highest resilience, whereas Montserrat had the lowest. This paper contributes to the hazard literature by demonstrating new vulnerability and resilience assessment methodologies that include validation and enable inference. The paper also contributes to the cartography and GIS literature by demonstrating the need to integrate data and perspectives from multiple disciplines and regions, as well as the ability of geospatial technology, in producing useful decision-making tools for a very pressing societal problem. © 2015 Cartography and Geographic Information Society","adaptability; Caribbean; resilience; Resilience Inference Measurement (RIM) model; vulnerability",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929017740

Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a weekend hospital intervention on processes of care and clinical outcomes. The multifaceted intervention included expanded weekend diagnostic services, improved weekend discharge processes, and increased physician and care management services on weekends. Design and Patients: This was an interrupted time series observational study of adult non-obstetric patients hospitalized at a single academic medical center between January 2011 and January 2014. The study included 18 months prior to and 19 months following the implementation of the intervention. Data were analyzed using segmented regression analysis with adjustment for confounders. Main Measures: The primary outcome was average length of stay. Secondary outcomes included percent of patients discharged on weekends, 30-day readmission rate, and in-hospital mortality rate. Key Results: The study included 57,163 hospitalizations. Following implementation of the intervention, average length of stay decreased by 13 % (95 % CI 10–15 %) and continued to decrease by 1 % (95 % CI 1–2 %) per month as compared to the underlying time trend. The proportion of weekend discharges increased by 12 % (95 % CI 2–22 %) at the time of the intervention and continued to increase by 2 % (95 % CI 1–3 %) per month thereafter. The intervention had no impact on readmissions or mortality. During the post-implementation period, the hospital was evacuated and closed for 2 months due to damage from Hurricane Sandy, and a new hospital-wide electronic health record was introduced. The contributions of these events to our findings are not known. We observed a lower inpatient census and found differences in patient characteristics, including higher rates of Medicaid insurance and comorbidities, in the post-Hurricane Sandy period as compared to the pre-Sandy period. Conclusions: The intervention was associated with a reduction in length of stay and an increase in weekend discharges. Our longitudinal study also illuminated the challenges of evaluating the effectiveness of a large-scale intervention in a real-world hospital setting. © 2015 Society of General Internal Medicine",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928963241

This paper describes the design, development and application of a conceptual foundation for a quantitative integrated coastal element vulnerability assessment using the up to date Source-Pathway-Receptor-Consequence (SPRC) approach. It is a conceptual model that combines a well-established approach in the field of waste and pollution management with the possibility of introducing the concept of system diagrams. Through the implementation of hazard classification, the approach leads to critical facilities identification and the loss estimation for specific hazards when different types of buildings are selected. In the example of Cayman Islands, the presence of exposed elements at risk, as the port or the airport, named critical facilities, drives serious potential damage effects due to high winds and storm surge. This approach provides both a spatial data infrastructure design, for collecting, storing and managing critical facilities information and a vulnerability assessment procedures for structural and operational components, concerning coastal zones affected by hurricane and related hazards. The final part of the paper synthesizes the conceptual treatment of coastal vulnerability in the Grand Cayman Island and underlines the ready-to-use GIS based vulnerability methodologies for risk assessment allowing to build capacity and resilience of the local communities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Anderson, M.G., The efficacy of a programme of landslide risk reduction in areas of unplanned housing in the Eastern Caribbean (2010) Environ.

As the genesis of these storms results from different basins and latitudes, the wind field characteristics may differ in these storms and differ with the recommendations in current wind codes, which are mainly based on extratropical winds. In order to delineate any differences, based on wind data measured at fixed/deployable towers in four typhoons and three hurricanes, turbulent wind characteristics, e.g., turbulence ratio and intensity, integral scale, gust factor, peak factor, skewness and kurtosis, were comparatively investigated and compared with the recommendations in ASCE7-10. In this comparison, the influences of roughness length and mean wind speed on the turbulent wind characteristics were also examined. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Boundary layer; Field measurement; Hurricane; Turbulent characteristics; Typhoon","Amano, T., Fukushima, H., Ohkuma, T., Kawaguchi, A., Goto, S., The observation of typhoon winds in Okinawa by Doppler sodar (1999) J.

In this paper, we expand the classic overlay method developed by Ian McHarg by incorporating sea level rise projections for the 2020s and 2050s into a GIS-based land use suitability analysis of New York City. This analysis considers elevation, slope, distance to coast, rock type, land cover, and sea level rise, which was modeled using a bathtub model. We use the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to produce weights for the criteria considered. Our results suggest that Eastern Staten Island and the southern shore of Brooklyn and Queens are especially unsuitable for future development without major adaptation measures. We also offer recommendations for improving this analysis through improved hydrological connectivity measures in modeling sea level rise, as well as better methods of accounting for policies influencing the manner of development in flood zones. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Ecological planning; Environmental planning; Hurricanes; Ian McHarg; Landscape suitability analysis; Natural hazards; Overlay analysis; Sea level rise; Suitability analysis","Aerts, J.C.H.J., Botzen, W.J.W., Flood-resilient waterfront development in New York City: Bridging flood insurance, building codes, and flood zoning (2011) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1227, pp. 1-82; Afrouz, A.A., (1992) Practical handbook of rock mass classification systems and modes of ground failure, , CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL; Alonso, J.A., Lamata, T., Consistency in the analytic hierarchy process: A new approach (2006) International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness, and Knowledge-Based Systems, 14 (4), pp. 445-459; Aly, M.H., Giardino, J.R., Klein, A.G., Suitability assessment for New Menia City, Egypt: A GIS approach to engineering geology (2005) Environmental & Engineering Geoscience, 9 (3), pp. 259-269; (2011), Snow, Water, Ice and Permafrost in the Arctic.

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have been simultaneously collected at copolarization (co-pol) and cross-pol at moderate to high wind speeds. Using the SAR co-pol retrieved wind fields and an uncertainty estimate of the retrieved wind speeds, the cross-pol dependencies of the NRCS are investigated with respect to wind, incidence angle, and polarization pairs. For wind speeds above 10 m/s, there is a significant dependence of the NRCS on wind speed. However, the SAR cross-pol data are also significantly affected by the noise floor and crosstalk between the channels. Estimates of the noise floor are determined and removed from the NRCS. Three GMFs are developed: the first is for transmission at horizontal (H) polarization and the second at vertical (V) polarization. A third GMF accounts for wind direction dependence. Validation of the GMFs is conducted by comparison with collocated Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) data. The resulting bias of -0.7 m/s and standard deviation of 3.7 m/s demonstrate the excellent performance for these GMFs for wind speed retrieval between 10 and 35 m/s. Furthermore, comparisons show that SAR cross-pol retrieved wind speeds are of similar quality as those of SFMR and are significantly better in the moderate to high wind speed regime than SAR co-pol retrieved winds. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","cyclones; geophysical measurements; hurricanes; oceans sea surface; radar cross-sections; Radar remote sensing; synthetic aperture radar; tropical cyclones","Bamler, R., Optimum look weighting for burst-mode and ScanSAR processing (1995) IEEE Trans.

Traditional recovery methods, i.e., inverse and Wiener filters, are attempted to restore the scene without the influence of RSF, which is inexistent in real observations and usually leads to the ringing artifact as well as uncertainties in noise amplification (NA). In this paper, a novel spatial-response matched filter (SRMF) and its processing method are established, where the aimed scene is supposed to be observed by instruments with higher PSF performance. Also, NA effects triggered by SRMF are precisely modeled and used for the further evaluation of radiometric accuracy (RA) variation after SRMF processing. Simulation results indicate that the SRMF method is more suitable for images with lower noise level and greater variation in the targets' radiation, where RA performance could be improved in a certain extent. Meanwhile, when the imager in a Multifunctional Transport Satellite is selected as the reference one with high-performance PSF, the SRMF for Fengyun-2 satellite is set up and applied for observations in thermal infrared band during April and May 2013. After SRMF processing, the recovered images show significant improvements in both visual effects and RA, where the increase of RA is expected to be 2-6 K at 190 K in statistics. Such a progress is believed to be beneficial to tropical cyclone intensity estimation as well as for other relevant products, i.e., cloud classification generation. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Infrared imaging; optical image processing; optical transfer functions","Curran, P.J., Dungan, J.L., Estimation of signal-to-noise: A new procedure applied to AVIRIS data (1989) IEEE Trans.

Experiments were run in hydrothermal cold-seal vessels at 300-450°C and 150MPa confining pressure for up to 1344h. Microfractures routinely form at grain contacts during these experiments. Microfracture kinematic-aperture distributions indicate that microfractures form within the first 48h of each experiment. Regardless of experimental temperature or duration, microfracture-sealing cements account for approximately the same amount of new quartz cement in each experiment. With increasing experimental duration, sealed microfractures were progressively overgrown by grain-boundary overgrowth cements. Spatial and temporal trends in the distribution of overgrowth- and microfracture-sealing cements indicate that precipitation rates on newly formed microfractures greatly exceed those on detrital-grain boundaries. This effect persists regardless of natural iron-oxide grain coatings present in a subset of our experiments. While our results agree with previous research that demonstrated increased growth rates on fracture surfaces in faults in fully lithified rock, fundamental differences in the nature of deformation in our experiments provide insight into quartz cementation in cataclastic deformation bands in faults offsetting high-porosity sandstones. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Deformation band; Diagenesis; Experiment; Fault; Microfracture; Quartz cement","Anders, M.H., Laubach, S.E., Scholz, C.H., Microfractures: a review (2014) J.Struct.

Regional governments, private enterprise (including the insurance and re-insurance industries), town planners and coastal developers are grappling to find sustainable solutions to coastal development while maintaining high rates of development and economic growth. Several nations and organisations have developed typhoon databases to collate the impacts of typhoons in various regions. However, these databases are not comparable or consistent in terms of the depth of information provided. This paper presents a new typhoon database for southern and eastern Chinese coastal regions (SECCR) spanning the period from 1951 to 2012. The database comprises comprehensive details of typhoons impacting Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the mainland Chinese provinces of Hainan, Fujian, Guangdong and Zhejiang. This new database provides an insight into the impacts of typhoons upon the economies and casualties suffered in each of the SECCR. There were 853 typhoons between 1951 and 2012, 286 typhoons caused human casualties, and 228 inflicted economic loss. The data shows an overall decrease of fatalities and economic loss. The database also shows a downward trend in the percentage of normalized economic loss in relation to the regional annual gross domestic product (GDP) for each province. The decline in both fatalities and relative economic losses in the SECCR may reflect improved adaptation and mitigation strategies to the impacts of typhoons in the Chinese coastal region. Further examination into the spatial and temporal features of typhoons that bring catastrophic damage to the SECCR can be managed with this newly developed database.

They result from complex processes of erosion, transport and deposition that can be difficult to study in detail. Here we present data from the Gaoping submarine canyon system, off SW Taiwan, which was perturbed in 2009 by the addition of flood deposits following Typhoon Morakot and sampled by gravity coring less than 2months after the event. We use the different origins of organic carbon, distinguished by their carbon and nitrogen concentrations and δ13C and δ15N isotopic composition, to compare and contrast standard and extreme sedimentological conditions.Using well-constrained end-members, the results were de-convolved into inputs of metamorphic and sedimentary fossil organic carbon eroded within the Gaoping River basin, terrestrial non-fossil carbon and marine organic matter. In the upper Gaoping Canyon, sedimentation is dominated by the highly-localised hyperpycnal input of river washload and submarine sediment slumps, each associated with extensive flooding following Typhoon Morakot, whilst the shelf experienced deposition and reworking of hemi-pelagic marine sediments. A terrestrial signal is also found in the core-top of a fine-grained shelf sample over 20. km from the Gaoping Canyon, in a region normally dominated by marine carbon deposition, showing that Morakot was an unusually large flood event. Conversely, sediment from just above the canyon thalweg contains 0.23. wt.% depth-averaged marine organic carbon (37% of the TOC content) implying that terrestrial OC-dominated turbidites are tightly constrained within the canyon. Hyperpycnal processes can lead to the rapid and efficient transport of both terrestrial and submarine sediments to more permanent burial locations. © 2015 .","Burial; Carbon; Export; Taiwan; Turbidite; Typhoon Morakot","Amy, L., Talling, P., Anatomy of turbidites and linked debrites based on long distance (120x30 km) bed correlation, Marnoso Arenacea Formation, Northern Apennines, Italy (2006) Sedimentology, 53, pp. 161-212; Arndt, S., Jørgensen, B.B., LaRowe, D.E., Middelburg, J.J., Pancost, R.D., Regnier, P., Quantifying the degradation of organic matter in marine sediments: a review and synthesis (2013) Earth Sci.

This empirical study extends previous investigations into the relationship between particle behaviour and cyclone operating conditions. Previous work concluded that particle agglomeration and attrition occurring in a small scale Stairmand cyclone were heavily dependent on inlet velocity. We report on the performance of two cyclones with similar geometries, but with a 66.2% difference in their vortex finder diameters. Despite inlet velocities that differ by less than 5.7%, the relative pressure drops vary between 96.5 and 105.7% from each other, which contributes to a significant difference in the separation efficiency curves of the two cyclones. The smaller vortex finder diameter produces superior separation efficiency and increased particle attrition. This implies that pressure drop across the cyclone and not inlet velocity is the critical parameter when considering particle behaviour in cyclones of different designs. The study also demonstrates the non-linear relationship between particle cut-size diameter and pressure drop, implying that the cut-size diameter may approach an optimum size. Further to these investigations the study reports near identical separation efficiency curves produced by two geometrically dissimilar cyclones. Although the inlet and vortex finder velocities of the two cyclones differ by 41.0% and 65.3% respectively, there is only a 2.1% difference in pressure drop.

The Spatial-Temporal Analysis of Moving Polygons (STAMP) method is applied to a multi-decadal dataset of aerial photography and LiDAR to extract patterns of two-dimensional movement and morphometric changes in erosional deflation basins and depositional lobes. Blowout development in CCNS is characterized by several geometric (overlap) and movement (proximity) responses, including: i) generation and disappearance, ii) extension and contraction, iii) union or division, iv) clustering and v) divergence by stabilization. Other possible movement events include migration, amalgamation and proximal stabilization, but they were not observed in this study. Generation events were more frequent than disappearance events; the former were highest between 1985 and 1994, while the latter were highest between 2000 and 2005. High rates of areal change in erosional basins occurred between 1998 and 2000 (+3932m2a-1), the lowest rate (+333m2a-1) between 2005 and 2009, and the maximum rate (+4589m2a-1) between 2009 and 2011. Union events occurred mostly in recent years (2000-2012), while only one division was observed earlier (1985-1994). Net areal changes of lobes showed gradual growth from a period of contraction (-1119m2a-1) between 1998 and 2000 to rapid extension (+2030m2a-1) by 2010, which is roughly concurrent with rapid growth of erosional basins between 2005 and 2009. Blowouts extended radially in this multi-modal wind regime and, despite odd shapes initially, they became simpler in form (more circular) and larger over time. Net extension of erosional basins was toward ESE (109°) while depositional lobes extended SSE (147°). Lobes were aligned with the strongest (winter) sand drift vector although their magnitude of areal extension was only 33% that of the basins. These differences in extension responses likely result from more complex and evolving flow-form interactions inside erosional basins. Historical photographs and CCNS documents suggest that blowout evolution may be influenced by land-use changes, such as revegetation campaigns in 1985 that were followed by high blowout generation. High magnitude regional storm events (e.g., hurricanes) also play a role. The analytical framework presented provides a systematic means for two-dimensional geomorphic change detection and pattern analysis that can be applied to other landscapes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aeolian; Blowout; Dune; GIS; Landscape evolution; Spatial-temporal analysis","Arens, S.M., Transport rates and volume changes in a coastal foredune on a Dutch Wadden island (1997) J.

The effect of this rhetorical strategy is to separate what happens to aboriginal people from the fabric of ‘mainstream’ Australian cultural and political life; to render it alien and unconnected to the relative privilege enjoyed by other Australians. This strategy also produces peculiar temporal effects by erecting a cordon sanitaire around Australian history and the national identity that it supports. Howard's comparison of aboriginal disadvantage with Katrina, if read alongside his politicization of the teaching of Australian history, demonstrates an unwillingness to incorporate systemic injustice toward indigenous people within the composition of that history. This article interrogates the relationships between the manifold understandings of aboriginal disadvantage and attempts to commemorate its violent history, as these aspects of Australian life are both integrated and refused by national identity narratives. Specifically, the paper reinterprets the trope of natural disaster as a means of comprehending indigenous disadvantage and Australian identity by drawing on Walter Benjamin's philosophy of history. Benjamin's understanding of activism as a constructive retrieval of the past will be developed to reconnect catastrophe to history, and to enable an exploration of responsibility for that history as an integral condition of contemporary Australian identity. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","aboriginal history; Australian identity; colonization; state of nature; Walter Benjamin",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928660623

Older adults designated as homebound due to their disabilities are at greatest risk of poor outcomes in disasters. This study aimed at assessing the willingness and ability of homebound older adults to evacuate, as well as categorizing their medical needs in the event they are relocated to an emergency shelter. Methods: Fifty-six homebound older adults and medical decision surrogates from 1 homebound primary care practice in Philadelphia were assessed with a novel structured interview. Results: Respondents reported limitations in both their ability and their willingness to evacuate their neighborhoods. Medical needs of homebound older adults were on par with those of nursing home residents. Conclusions: Many homebound older adults are unable or unwilling to evacuate in a mandatory evacuation situation, highlighting a need for public assistance. Their complex medical needs will require significant preparation by special needs shelters.

In the aftermath, New York implemented a home buyout program designed to facilitate the permanent relocation of residents out of areas considered to be at risk for future hazards. While home buyout programs are becoming popular as policy tools for disaster mitigation, little is known about what factors influence homeowners to participate in or reject these programs. This study used mixed methods to assess the relationship between community resilience and the relocation decision in two heavily damaged communities in which the majority of residents made different decisions regarding whether or not to pursue a buyout. The sample was composed of residents from Oakwood Beach and Rockaway Park, both working-class communities in New York City, who participated via a community survey (N = 133) and/or in-depth interviews (N = 28). Results suggested that community resilience moderated the relationship between community of residence and the buyout decision, leading to opposite responses on the buyout decision. Contextual community factors, including the history of natural disasters, local cultural norms, and sense of place, were instrumental in explaining these different responses. Implications for disaster policy are discussed. © 2015 Society for Community Research and Action","Climate adaptation; Community resilience; Disaster recovery; Home buyout; Hurricane Sandy; Postdisaster relocation",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928318816

The 2012 Hurricane Sandy event is in many ways indicative of what may become a major issue in densely populated coastal centers whose unsustainable land use patterns often dictate their inherently low resilience to coastal hazards. Ideally, disaster-affected communities should recognize this window of opportunity to reverse said trends, establish realistic linkages between risks and response options, and engage in innovative adaptation. Despite increasing exposure to repetitive hazards and new risk information, many places still prefer to simply rebuild, maintain status quo, or support only conservative in situ adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. However, some circumstances call for more drastic and permanent solutions, such as relocation. This paper presents a novel integrated framework for the Relocation Potential Assessment of Coastal Communities designed to inform dilemma whether to rebuild or relocate from coastal areas devastated by a disaster. The main objective of this early effort is to propose metrics for the development of comprehensive assessment tool that will help identify areas of heightened social and physical vulnerabilities for which relocation may represent a more viable adaptation option. The proposed two-pronged approach promulgates the need for the integration of qualitative secondary data on socioeconomic profile, physical risks, and disaster exposure, with the bottom-up generated information on additional household-specific concerns that would improve accuracy and validity of considered stressors and therefore the usability of relocation potential assessment tool. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Coastal; Hurricane Sandy; Relocation; Resilience; Retreat",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928137409

However, the SAR approach rarely considers the spatial variability of individual plants that arises from species interactions and species' habitat associations. Here, we explored how the interactions of individual plants of target species influence SAR patterns at a range of neighborhood distances. We analyzed the data of 113,988 woody plants of 110 species from the Fushan Forest Dynamics Plot (25 ha), northern Taiwan, which is a subtropical rainforest heavily influenced by typhoons. We classified 34 dominant species into 3 species types (i.e., accumulator, repeller, or no effect) by testing how the individual species-area relationship (i.e., statistics describing how neighborhood species richness changes around individuals) of target species departs (i.e., positively, negatively, or with no obvious trend) from a null model that accounts for habitat association. Deviation from the null model suggests that the net effect of species' interactions increases (accumulate) or decreases (repel) neighborhood species richness. We found that (i) accumulators were dominant at small interaction distances (<10-30 m); (ii) the detection of accumulator species was lower at large interaction distances (>30 m); (iii) repellers were rarely detected; and (iv) largesized and abundant species tended to be accumulators. The findings suggest that positive species interactions have the potential to accumulate neighborhood species richness, particularly through size- and density-dependent mechanisms. We hypothesized that the frequently disturbed environment of this subtropical rainforest (e.g., typhoon-driven natural disturbances such as landslides, soil erosion, flooding, and windthrow) might create the spatial heterogeneity of species richness and promote positive species interactions. © 2015 Tsai et al.",,"Ricklefs, R.E., (1990) Ecology, , New York: W.

The model combines the second-order small-slope approximation theory with the vector radiative transfer theory to obtain a statistical expression of the ocean scattering in presence of foam. Cross-polarized backscatter signals from RADARSAT-2 C-band synthetic aperture radar imagery, which were acquired during severe weather events, and collocated/time-coincident stepped-frequency microwave radiometer wind measurements by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's hurricane-hunter aircraft are used to verify the model. The validity of the model has been also proven against European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts forecasted winds. The results suggest that the present scattering model can be a valuable tool for understanding VH at very high wind speeds and for interpreting the data collected by the future dual polarimetric wind scatterometer (SCA), which will be flown on the Second Generation Meteorological Operational satellite program (MetOp-SG) as an evolution of the Advanced Scatterometer instrument on board MetOp.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927723813

Since 1985, 44 TCs generated gale force winds (17 metres/second) within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP). Of the hurricane strength TCs (H1-Saffir Simpson scale; - category 3 Australian scale), TC Yasi (February, 2011) was the largest. In the weeks after TC Yasi crossed the GBRMP, participating researchers, managers and rangers assessed the extent and severity of reef damage via 841 Reef Health and Impact Surveys at 70 reefs. Records were scaled into five damage levels representing increasingly widespread colony-level damage (1, 2, 3) and reef structural damage (4, 5). Average damage severity was significantly affected by direction (north vs south of the cyclone track), reef shelf position (mid-shelf vs outershelf) and habitat type. More outer-shelf reefs suffered structural damage than mid-shelf reefs within 150 km of the track. Structural damage spanned a greater latitudinal range for mid-shelf reefs than outer-shelf reefs (400 vs 300 km). Structural damage was patchily distributed at all distances, but more so as distance from the track increased. Damage extended much further from the track than during other recent intense cyclones that had smaller circulation sizes. Just over 15% (3,834 km2) of the total reef area of the GBRMP is estimated to have sustained some level of coral damage, with ~4% (949 km2) sustaining a degree of structural damage. TC Yasi likely caused the greatest loss of coral cover on the GBR in a 24-hour period since 1985. Severely impacted reefs have started to recover; coral cover increased an average of 4%between 2011 and 2013 at re-surveyed reefs. The in situ assessment of impacts described here is the largest in scale ever conducted on the Great Barrier Reef following a reef health disturbance. © 2015 Beeden et al.",,"Scoffin, T.P., The geological effects of hurricanes on coral reefs and the interpretation of storm deposits (1993) Coral Reefs., 12, pp. 203-221; Harmelin-Vivien, M.L., The effects of storms and cyclones on coral reefs: A review (1994) Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue, 12, pp. 211-231; Done, T.J., Effects of tropical cyclone waves on ecological and geomorphological structures on the Great Barrier Reef (1992) Cont Shelf Res., 12, p. 859; Fabricius, K.E., De'ath, G., Puotinen, M.L., Done, T., Cooper, T.F., Burgess, S.C., Disturbance gradients on inshore and offshore coral reefs caused by a severe tropical cyclone (2008) Limnol Oceanogr, 53, pp. 690-704; Connell, J.H., Hughes, T.P., Wallace, C.C., A 30 year study of coral abundance, recruitment and disturbance at several scales in space and time (1997) Ecol Monogr., 67 (4), pp. 461-488; Hughes, T.P., Connell, J.H., Multiple stressors on coral reefs: A long-term perspective (1999) Limnol Oceanogr., 44, pp. 932-940; Hughes, T.P., Tanner, J.E., Recruitment failure, life histories, and long-term decline of Caribbean corals (2000) Ecol., 81, pp. 2250-2263; Coles, S., Brown, E., Twenty-five years of change in coral coverage on a hurricane impacted reef in Hawai' i: The importance of recruitment (2007) Coral Reefs., 26, pp. 705-717; Hughes, T.P., Catastrophes, phase shifts and the large scale degredataion of a Caribbean coral reef (1994) Science, p. 1547; Hughes, T.P., Rodrigues, M.J., Bellwood, D.R., Ceccarelli, D., Hoegh-Guldberg, O., McCook, L., Phase shifts, herbivory and the resilience of coral reefs to climate change (2007) Curr Biol., 17 (4), pp. 360-365. , PMID: 17291763; Hughes, T.P., Graham, N.A.J., Jackson, J.B.C., Mumby, P.J., Steneck, R.S., Rising to the challenge of sustaining coral reef resilience (2010) Trends Ecol Evol., 25, pp. 633-642. , PMID: 20800316; Graham, N.A.J., Nash, K.M., Kool, T.J., Coral reef recovery dynamics in a changing world (2011) Coral Reefs., 30, pp. 283-294; McClanahan, T.R., Polunin, N.V.C., Done, T.J., Resilience of coral reefs (2002) Resilience and the Behavior of Large-Scale Systems, , Gunderson LH and Pritchard L (eds.), 60 ed.

Here we present a 2,200-y-long, accurate, and precisely dated record of cave flooding events from the northwest Australian tropics that we interpret, based on an integrated analysis of meteorological data and sediment layers within stalagmites, as representing a proxy for extreme rainfall events derived primarily from tropical cyclones (TCs) and secondarily from the regional summer monsoon. This time series reveals substantial multicentennial variability in extreme rainfall, with elevated occurrence rates characterizing the twentieth century, 850-1450 CE (Common Era), and 50-400 CE; reduced activity marks 1450-1650 CE and 500-850 CE. These trends are similar to reconstructed numbers of TCs in the North Atlantic and Caribbean basins, and they form temporal and spatial patterns best explained by secular changes in the dominant mode of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the primary driver of modern TC variability. We thus attribute long-term shifts in cyclogenesis in both the central Australian and North Atlantic sectors over the past two millennia to entrenched El Niño or La Niña states of the tropical Pacific. The influence of ENSO on monsoon precipitation in this region of northwest Australia is muted, but ENSO-driven changes to the monsoon may have complemented changes to TC activity. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

Analysis of all six AMSR2 C- and X-band channel measurements over TCs is shown to efficiently help to separate the rain contribution. Corrected measurements at 6.9 and 10.65 GHz are then used to retrieve the SWS. Spatial and temporal collocation of AMSR2 and tropical rain measurement mission (TRMM) microwave instrument (TMI) data is then further used to empirically relate TMI rain rate (RR) product to RR estimates from AMSR2 in hurricanes. SWS estimates are validated with measurements from the stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR). As further tested, more than 100 North Atlantic and North Pacific TCs are analyzed for the 2012–2014 period. Despite few particular cases, most SWS fields are in a very good agreement with TC center data on maximum wind speeds, radii of storm, and hurricane winds. As also compared, very high consistency between AMSR2 and L-band SMOS wind speed estimates are obtained, especially for the super typhoon Haiyan, to prove the high potential of AMSR2 measurements in TCs.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927726719

These surges can transport salt water and sediment to freshwater bogs, greatly affecting their biological integrity. Purple pitcher plants (Sarracenia rosea ) are Gulf Coast pitcher plant bog inhabitants that could be at a disadvantage under this scenario because their pitcher morphology may leave them prone to collection of saline water and sediment after a surge. We investigated the effects of storm surge water salinity and sediment type on S. rosea vitality, plant community structure, and bog soil-water conductivity. Plots (containing ≥1 ramet of S. rosea ) were experimentally flooded with fresh or saline water crossed with one of three sediment types (local, foreign, or no sediment). There were no treatment effects on soil-water conductivity; nevertheless, direct exposure to saline water resulted in significantly lower S. rosea cover until the following season when a prescribed fire and regional drought contributed to the decline of all the S. rosea to near zero percent cover. There were also significant differences in plant community structure between treatments over time, reflecting how numerous species increased in abundance and a few species decreased in abundance. However, in contrast to S. rosea, most of the other species in the community appeared resilient to the effects of storm surge. Thus, although the community may be somewhat affected by storm surge, those few species that are particularly sensitive to the storm surge disturbance will likely drop out of the community and be replaced by more resilient species. Depending on the longevity of these biological legacies, Gulf Coastal pitcher plant bogs may be incapable of fully recovering if they become exposed to storm surge more frequently due to climate change. © 2015 Abbott, Battaglia.",,"Walker, J., Peet, R.K., Composition and species-diversity of pine-wiregrass savannas of the Green Swamp, North Carolina (1984) Vegetatio, 55, pp. 163-179; Christensen, N.L., Fire and soil-plant nutrient relations in a pine-wiregrass savanna on coastal-plain of North Carolina (1977) Oecologia, 31, pp. 27-44; Folkerts, G.W., The Gulf Coast pitcher plant bogs (1982) Am Sci, 70, pp. 260-267; Michener, W.K., Blood, E.R., Bildstein, K.L., Brinson, M.M., Gardner, L.R., Climate change, hurricanes and tropical storms, and rising sea level in coastal wetlands (1997) Ecol Appl, 7, pp. 770-801; Church, J.A., White, N.J., A 20th century acceleration in global sea-level rise (2006) Geophys Res Lett, 33, pp. 1-4; IPCC, (2007) The Physical Science Basis, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Rahmstorf, S., A semi-empirical approach to projecting future sea-level rise (2007) Science, 315, pp. 368-370. , PMID: 17170254; Emanuel, K., Increasing destructiveness of tropical cyclones over the past 30 years (2005) Nature, 436, pp. 686-688. , PMID: 16056221; Webster, P.J., Holland, G.J., Curry, J.A., Chang, H.R., Changes in tropical cyclone number, duration, and intensity in a warming environment (2005) Science, 309, pp. 1844-1846. , PMID: 16166514; Bender, M.A., Knutson, T.R., Tuleya, R.E., Sirutis, J.J., Vecchi, G.A., Garner, S.T., Modeled impact of anthropogenic warming on the frequency of intense Atlantic hurricanes (2010) Science, 327, pp. 454-458. , PMID: 20093471; Grindsted, A., Moore, J.C., Jevrejeva, S., Projected Atlantic hurricane surge threat from rising temperatures (2013) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 110, pp. 5369-5373. , PMID: 23509254; Battaglia, L.L., Woodrey, M.S., Peterson, M.S., Dillon, K.S., Visser, J.M., Wetland Ecosystems of the Northern Gulf Coast (2012) Wetlands of North America: Ecology and Conservation Concerns, pp. 75-88. , Batzer D, Baldwin A, editors Oakland: University of California Press; Donnelly, J.P., Bertness, M.D., Rapid shoreward encroachment of salt marsh cordgrass in response to accelerated sea-level rise (2001) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 98, pp. 14218-14223. , PMID: 11724926; Hook, D.D., Buford, M.A., Williams, T.M., Impact of Hurricane Hugo on the South Carolina coastal plain forest (1991) J Coastal Res, 8, pp. 291-300; Tate, A.S., Battaglia, L.L., Community disassembly and reassembly following experimental storm surge and wrack application (2013) J Veg Sci, 24, pp. 46-57; Middleton, B.A., Regeneration of coastal marsh vegetation impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (2009) Wetlands, 29, pp. 54-65; Schnell, D.E., (2002) Carnivorous Plants of the United States and Canada, , Portland: Timber Press; Naczi, R.F.C., Soper, E.M., Case, F.W., Case, R.B., Sarracenia rosea (Sarraceniaceae), a new species of pitcher plant from the southeastern United States (1999) SIDA Contrib Bot, 18, pp. 1183-1206; Peet, R.K., Allard, D.J., Longleaf pine vegetation of the southern Atlantic and eastern Gulf coast regions: A preliminary classification Proceedings Tall Timbers Fire Ecology Conference 1993, 18, pp. 45-81; NOAA, (2012) NOWData Weather Averages (1927-2011) for Pensacola Regional Airport, , http://www.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=mob, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Weather Service Forecast Office, Mobile, AL Available; Turner, R.E., Baustian, J.J., Swenson, E.M., Spicer, J.S., Wetland sedimentation from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (2006) Science, 314, pp. 449-452. , PMID: 16990516; McKee, K.L., Cherry, J.A., Hurricane Katrina sediment slowed elevation loss in subsiding brackish marshes of the Mississippi river delta (2009) Wetlands, 29, pp. 2-15; Reed, D.J., Patterns of sediment deposition in subsiding coastal salt marshes, Terrebonne Bay, Louisiana - The role of winter storms (1989) Estuaries Coast, 12, pp. 222-227; Clewell, A.F., (1985) Guide to the Vascular Plants of the Florida Panhandle, , Gainesville: University Presses of Florida; Rhoades, J.D., Salinity: Electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids (1996) Methods of Soil Analysis.

Following exposure to disasters, adolescents may undergo mental health challenges that threaten factors critical to school satisfaction, such as positive school climate and supportive school relationships. Objective: The current study examined the mediating role of posttraumatic stress symptoms on the relationship between exposure to a hurricane and school dissatisfaction. Method: Regression analyses were used to test relationships in a large sample of predominately White female high school students who participated in a needs assessment 6 months after Hurricane Katrina. Results: Results revealed a significant, direct association between hurricane exposure and dissatisfaction with school, as well as indirect associations via posttraumatic stress symptoms. Conclusions: These findings underscore the need for research to explicate the relationship between disasters and school satisfaction. Research is also needed to determine whether school-based interventions that have shown success in reducing anxiety symptoms in youth post-disaster also work to minimize disruptions in the school environment and ultimately reduce dissatisfaction with school. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Adolescents; Disasters; Posttraumatic stress symptoms; School satisfaction",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927534703

Floods have a negative impact on mental health. Comprehensive evaluation and review of the literature are lacking. Objective: To systematically map and review available scientific evidence on mental health impacts of floods caused by extended periods of heavy rain in river catchments. Methods: We performed a systematic mapping review of published scientific literature in five languages for mixed studies on floods and mental health. PUBMED and Web of Science were searched to identify all relevant articles from 1994 to May 2014 (no restrictions). Results: The electronic search strategy identified 1331 potentially relevant papers. Finally, 83 papers met the inclusion criteria. Four broad areas are identified: i) the main mental health disorders - post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety; ii] the factors associated with mental health among those affected by floods; iii) the narratives associated with flooding, which focuses on the long-term impacts of flooding on mental health as a consequence of the secondary stressors; and iv) the management actions identified. The quantitative and qualitative studies have consistent findings. However, very few studies have used mixed methods to quantify the size of the mental health burden as well as exploration of in-depth narratives. Methodological limitations include control of potential confounders and short-term follow up. Limitations: Floods following extreme events were excluded from our review. Conclusions: Although the level of exposure to floods has been systematically associated with mental health problems, the paucity of longitudinal studies and lack of confounding controls precludes strong conclusions. Implications: We recommend that future research in this area include mixed-method studies that are purposefully designed, using more rigorous methods. Studies should also focus on vulnerable groups and include analyses of policy and practical responses. © 2015 Fernandez et al.",,"Alderman, K., Turner, L.R., Tong, S., Floods and human health: A systematic review (2012) Environ Int, 47, pp. 37-47. , PMID: 22750033;

This time, Super Typhoon Haiyan, also known as Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines, devastated the Eastern Visayas islands on 8 November 2013. Its classification as a super typhoon was based on its maximum sustained 1 min surface wind speed of 315 km h-1, which is equivalent to a strong Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. This was one of the deadliest typhoon events in the Philippines' history, after the 1897 and 1912 tropical cyclones. At least 6268 individuals have been reported dead and 1061 people are missing. In addition, a wide area of destruction was observed in the Eastern Visayas, on Samar and Leyte islands. The International Research Institute of Disaster Science (IRIDeS) at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan, has deployed several teams for damage recognition, relief support and collaboration with regard to this disaster event. One of the teams, the hazard and damage evaluation team, visited the affected areas in the Eastern Visayas in mid-January 2014. In this paper, we summarize the rapid damage assessment from satellite imagery conducted days after the event and report on the inundation measurements and the damage surveyed in the field. Damage interpretation results by satellite images were qualitatively confirmed for the Tacloban city area on Leyte Island, the most populated city in the Eastern Visayas. During the survey, significant damage was observed from wind and storm surges on poorly designed housing on the east coast of Leyte Island. Damage, mainly from surface waves and winds, was observed on the east coast of Samar Island. © Author(s) 2015.",,"Barnes, C.F., Fritz, H.M., Yoo, J., Hurricane disaster assessment with image-driven data mining in high-resolution satellite imagery (2007) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing: Special Issue: Remote Sensing for Major Disaster Prevention, Monit.

The objective of this analysis was to compare reporting of disaster exposure on a trauma questionnaire (Brief Trauma Questionnaire [BTQ]) to an inventory of disaster experience. Between 2011 and 2014, a sample of 841 reproductive-aged southern Louisiana women were interviewed using the BTQ and completed a detailed inventory about exposure to hurricanes and flooding. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomology was measured with the Post-Traumatic Stress Checklist, and depression with the Edinburgh Depression Scale. The single question addressing disaster exposure on the BTQ had a sensitivity of between 65% and 70% relative to the more detailed questions. Reporting disaster exposure on the BTQ was more likely for those who reported illness/injury due to a hurricane or flood (74%-77%) or danger (77-79%), compared to those who reported damage (69-71%) or evacuation (64-68%). Reporting disaster exposure on the BTQ was associated with depression (odds ratio [OR] 2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43-3.68). A single question is unlikely to be useful for assessing the degree of exposure to disaster across a broad population, and varies in utility depending on the mental health outcome of interest: the single trauma question is useful for assessing depression risk. © 2015 Harville et al.",,"Goodman, L.A., Corcoran, C., Turner, K., Yuan, N., Green, B.L., Assessing traumatic event exposure: General issues and preliminary findings for the Stressful Life Events Screening Questionnaire (1998) J Trauma Stress., 11 (3), pp. 521-542. , PMID: 9690191; Breslau, N., Kessler, R.C., The stressor criterion in DSM-IV posttraumatic stress disorder: An empirical investigation (2001) Biol Psychiatry., 50 (9), pp. 699-704. , PMID: 11704077; Friedman, M.J., Resick, P.A., Bryant, R.A., Brewin, C.R., Considering PTSD for DSM-5 (2010) Depress Anxiety., 0, pp. 1-20; Norris, F.H., Friedman, M.J., Watson, P.J., 60,000 disaster victims speak: Part II.

As sea level rises over the long term, the shoreface and inner shelf are eroded as barrier islands migrate landward; large storms like Sandy are thought to be a primary driver of this largely evolutionary process. The ""before"" data were collected in 2011 by the U.S. Geological Survey as part of a long-term investigation of the Fire Island barrier system. The ""after"" data were collected in January, 2013, ~two months after the storm. Surprisingly, no widespread erosional event was observed. Rather, the primary impact of Sandy on the shoreface and inner shelf was to force migration of major bedforms (sand ridges and sorted bedforms) 10's of meters WSW alongshore, decreasing in migration distance with increasing water depth. Although greater in rate, this migratory behavior is no different than observations made over the 15-year span prior to the 2011 survey. Stratigraphic observations of buried, offshore-thinning fluvial channels indicate that long-term erosion of older sediments is focused in water depths ranging from the base of the shoreface (~13-16. m) to ~21. m on the inner shelf, which is coincident with the range of depth over which sand ridges and sorted bedforms migrated in response to Sandy. We hypothesize that bedform migration regulates erosion over these water depths and controls the formation of a widely observed transgressive ravinement; focusing erosion of older material occurs at the base of the stoss (upcurrent) flank of the bedforms. Secondary storm impacts include the formation of ephemeral hummocky bedforms and the deposition of a mud event layer. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Inner shelf; Ravinement; Sand ridges; Shoreface; Sorted bedforms; Superstorm sandy","Allen, G.P., Posamentier, H.W., Sequence stratigraphy and facies model of an incised valley fill: the Gironde Estuary, France (1993) J.

Understanding these N inputs during extreme rain events is increasingly important since global climate change may alter hurricane activity. In this study, ten sequential Hurricane Irene rain samples were analyzed for isotopic composition of nitrate (NO3-) to investigate NOx (=NO+NO2) sources contributing to NO3- deposited by a hurricane. The samples were divided into three groups (I, II, II) by k-means clustering using rain event back trajectories, δ15N-NO3- values, and NO3- concentrations. Chemical, physical and isotopic analyses, including δ15N- and δ18O-NO3-, anions, cations, H+, H2O2, DOC, acetaldehyde, ethanol and rainfall intensity, were then used to explore similarities in geographic origins and potential relationships with NOx and other emission sources. While it is possible that all samples had contributions from various NOx sources, group I samples had marine back trajectories and a mean δ15N-NO3- value (-0.7±1.9‰) suggesting primarily lightning-sourced NOx contributions to NO3- deposition. As the hurricane made landfall, Group II samples transitioned to reflect more of a terrestrial signature with a higher mean δ15N-NO3- value (+11.0±0.5‰) indicating NOx emission contributions from vehicles and power plants sources. As the hurricane continued to move inland, Group III δ15N-NO3- values (-5.5 and-5.7‰) reflect the potential mixing of biogenic soil NOx emissions with vehicle and power plant sources. Higher concentrations of ethanol, acetaldehyde, NH4+, and carbohydrates in Group III samples support the influence of biogenic sources. The isotopic composition of NO3- in hurricane rain can aid in discerning varying NOx sources contributing to nitrate concentrations in extreme rain events. This knowledge can in turn further our understanding of how forthcoming hurricane events may alter the N cycle of an ecosystem. © 2015 .","Emissions; Hurricane; Isotope; Nitrate; NOx; Wet deposition","Ammann, M., Siegwolf, R., Pichlmayer, F., Suter, M., Saurer, M., Brunold, C., Estimating the uptake of traffic-derived NO2 from 15N abundance in Norway spruce needles (1999) Oecologia, 118, pp. 124-131; Buda, A.R., DeWalle, D.R., Using atmospheric chemistry and storm track information to explain the variation of nitrate stable isotopes in precipitation at a site in central Pennsylvania, USA (2009) Atmos.

The fundamental basis of the RAMARS follows the concept of the GPROF algorithm, which means, being consistent with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar rain rate observations, but independent of any auxiliary information. The RAMARS is built upon the combination of state-of-the-art machine learning and regression techniques, comprising of random forest algorithm, RReliefF, and multivariate adaptive regression splines. The RAMARS is applicable to both over ocean and land as well as coast surface terrains. It has been demonstrated that, when comparing with the TRMM Precipitation Radar observations, the performance of the RAMARS algorithm is comparable with the 2A12 GPROF algorithm. Furthermore, the RAMARS has been applied to two cyclonic cases, hurricane Sandy in 2012, and cyclone Mahasen in 2013, showing a very good capability to reproduce the structure and intensity of the cyclone fields. The RAMARS is highly flexible, because of its four processing components, making it extremely suitable for use to other passive microwave imagers in the global precipitation measurement (GPM) constellation. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",,"Biscaro, T.S., Morales, C.A., Continental passive microwave-based rainfall estimation algorithm: Application to the Amazon basin (2008) J.

Impact forces imposed on buildings and bridges from such debris can lead to extensive structural damage. A reliable estimation of debris impact demands is vital for the safe design of structures against water-borne debris. The objectives of this study are to investigate the effect that supplemental non-structural mass attached to debris has on the generated impact demands and to develop a simple model that accurately estimates the peak impact force, impulse, and duration. An experimental study is carried out on a loaded shipping container subjected to in-air axial impacts. A nonlinear dynamic finite element model of a standard shipping container including contents is developed and validated by comparing with the full-scale impact experiments. Parametric studies are carried out to investigate the effects of impact velocity, nonstructural mass attachment, and magnitude of payload mass during both elastic and inelastic axial impact of a shipping container. The results indicate that the peak impact force is not affected by a non-rigidly attached payload mass.

This work has primarily focused on the science of climate change, impacts, and mitigation, yet our understanding on how adaptation is being profiled in the media is limited. In response to this gap, this paper quantitatively examines the coverage and framing of climate change adaptation in four influential North American newspapers between 1993 and 2013. Over the observation period, the total number of articles focusing on adaptation published each year increases, with peaks in reporting in 2007, 2012, and 2013. While adaptation has permeated news coverage, it still remains overshadowed by stories on impacts and mitigation, with increased reporting consistent with increased media attention to climate change over the last two decades. Of the newspaper articles with adaptation content (. n=. 271), the majority (53%) focus primarily on stating the need to adapt, as opposed to documenting actual preparations being undertaken for adaptation or profiling actual adaptations that have taken place. The types of adaptation being reported on are predominantly 'hard' in nature, profiling techno-engineering based responses to reduce potential climate change impacts, in contrast to 'soft' responses that seek to enhance resilience. This representation is particularly evident in reporting in 2012 and 2013. Adaptations being described in the selected newspaper articles are primarily anticipatory in nature up until 2011, after which adaptations are primarily discussed in terms of responding to extreme weather events, specifically in the context of a surge in reporting documented in response to Hurricane Sandy (2012) and flooding in Canada in 2013. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptation; Climate change; Framing; Media; Newspapers; North america","(2014), http://www.4imn.com/topNorth-America/, 4imn.com, 2014 Newspaper RankingsAdger, W.N., Arnell, N.W., Tompkins, E.L., Successful adaptation to climate change across scales (2005) Global Environ.

This challenge is driving fresh approaches to assess high-impact weather and climate. Recent lessons learned in modeling high-impact weather and climate are presented using the case of tropical cyclones as an illustrative example. Through examples using the Nested Regional Climate Model to dynamically downscale large-scale climate data the need to treat bias in the driving data is illustrated. Domain size, location, and resolution are also shown to be critical and should be adequate to: include relevant regional climate physical processes; resolve key impact parameters; and accurately simulate the response to changes in external forcing. The notion of sufficient model resolution is introduced together with the added value in combining dynamical and statistical assessments to fill out the parent distribution of high-impact parameters. © 2013, The Author(s).",,"Bender, M.A., Knutson, T.R., Tuleya, R.E., Sirutis, J.J., Vecchi, G.A., Garner, S.T., Held, I.M., Modeled impact of anthropogenic warming on the frequency of intense Atlantic hurricanes (2010) Science, 22, pp. 454-458; Bengtsson, L., Hodges, K.I., Esch, M., Keenlyside, N., Kornblueh, L., Luo, J.-J., Yamagata, T., How may tropical cyclones change in a warmer climate (2007) Tellus, 59A, pp. 539-561; Bruyère, C.L., Holland, G.J., Towler, E., Investigating the use of a genesis potential index for tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic Basin (2012) J Clim, 25 (24), pp. 8611-8626; Camargo, S.J., Sobel, A.H., Barnston, A.G., Emanuel, K.A., Tropical cyclone genesis potential index in climate models (2007) Tellus, 59A, pp. 428-443; Caron, L.-P., Jones, C.G., Understanding and simulating the link between African Easterly Waves and Atlantic Tropical Cyclones using a Regional Climate Model: the role of domain size and lateral boundary conditions (2011) Clim Dyn; Caron, L.-P., Jones, C.G., Winger, K., Impact of resolution and downscaling technique in simulating recent Atlantic Tropical Cyclone Activity (2010) Clim Dyn; Coles, S., (2001) An introduction to statistical modeling of extreme values, , Springer, London: 208 pp; Collins, W.D., Bitz, C.M., Blackmon, M.L., Bonan, G.B., Bretherton, C.S., Carton, J.A., Chang, P., Smith, R.D., The community climate system model version 3 (CCSM3) (2006) J Clim, 19, pp. 2122-2143; Davis, C., Prediction of landfalling hurricanes with the advanced hurricane WRF model (2008) Mon Weather Rev, 136, pp. 1990-2005; Davis, C., Wang, W., Cavallo, S., Done, J., Dudhia, J., Fredrick, S., Michalakes, J., Torn, R., High-resolution hurricane forecasts.

The recently published methodology termed the Coastal Hazard Wheel (CHW) is designed for local, regional and national hazard screening in areas with limited data availability, and covers the hazards of ecosystem disruption, gradual inundation, salt water intrusion, erosion and flooding. The application makes use of published geophysical data and remote sensing information and is showcasing how the CHW framework can be applied at a scale relevant for regional planning purposes. It uses a GIS approach to develop regional and sub-regional hazard maps as well as to produce relevant hazard risk data, and includes a discussion of uncertainties, limitations and management perspectives. The hazard assessment shows that 61 percent of Karnataka's coastline has a high or very high inherent hazard of erosion, making erosion the most prevalent coastal hazard. The hazards of flooding and salt water intrusion are also relatively widespread as 39 percent of Karnataka's coastline has a high or very high inherent hazard for both of these hazard types. © 2014 The Authors.","Climate change; Coastal hazard assessment; Coastal hazard wheel; Coastal planning; India","Dwarakish, G.S., Vinay, S.A., Natesan, U., Asano, T., Kakinuma, T., Venkataramana, K., Jagadeesha Pai, B., Babita, M.K., Coastal vulnerability assessment of the future sea level rise in Udupi coastal zone of Karnataka state, west coast of India (2009) Ocean Coast.

As other natural hazards, landslides are difficult to predict, and their forecasts are uncertain. The uncertainty depends on the poor understanding of the phenomena that control the slope failures, and on the inherent complexity and chaotic nature of the landslides. This is similar to other natural hazards, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, and droughts. Due to the severe impact of landslides on the population, the environment, and the economy, forecasting landslides is of scientific interest and of societal relevance, and scientists attempting to forecast landslides face known and new problems intrinsic to the multifaceted interactions between science, decision-making, and the society. The problems include deciding on the authority and reliability of individual scientists and groups of scientists, and evaluating the performances of individual scientists, research teams, and their institutions. Related problems lay in the increasing subordination of research scientists to politics and decision-makers, and in the conceptual and operational models currently used to organize and pay for research, based on apparently objective criteria and metrics, considering science as any other human endeavor, and favoring science that produces results of direct and immediate application. The paper argues that the consequences of these problems have not been considered fully. © 2015 The Author(s).

Retrieving leaf area index (LAI) and its dynamics by remote sensing is of great significance in ecological study and production management, such as yield prediction and post-hurricane damage evaluation. Thirteen HJ-1A/1B CCD images, which possess the spatial advantage of Landsat TM/ETM+ and 2-days temporal resolution of MODIS, were introduced to predict the spatial-temporal LAI of rubber plantation on Hainan Island by Nonlinear AutoRegressive networks with eXogenous inputs (NARX) model. Monthly measured LAIs at 30 stands by LAI-2000 between 2012 and 2013 were used to explore the LAI dynamics and their relationship with spectral bands and seven vegetation indices, and to develop and validate model. The NARX model, which was built base on input variables of day of year (DOY), four spectral bands and weight difference vegetation index (WDVI), possessed good accuracies during the model building for the data set of training (N=202,R2=0.98,RMSE=0.13), validation (N=43,R2=0.93,RMSE=0.24) and testing (N=43,R2=0.87,RMSE=0.31), respectively. The model performed well during field validation (N=24,R2=0.88,RMSE=0.24) and most of its mapping results showed better agreement (R2=0.54-0.58,RMSE=0.47-0.71) with the field data than the results of corresponding stepwise regression models (R2=0.43-0.51,RMSE=0.52-0.82). Besides, the LAI statistical values from the spatio-temporal LAI maps and their dynamics, which increased dramatically from late March (2.36±0.59) to early May (3.22±0.64) and then gradually slow down until reached the maximum value in early October (4.21±0.87), were quite consistent with the statistical results of the field data. The study demonstrates the feasibility and reliability of retrieving spatio-temporal LAI of rubber plantations by an artificial neural network (ANN) approach, and provides some insight on the application of HJ-1A/1B CCD images, and data and methods for productivity study of rubber plantation in future. © 2014.","HJ-1A/1B CCD; Leaf area index; NARX; Recurrent neural network; Rubber plantation","Aosier, B., Kaneko, M., Takada, M., Evaluation of the forest damage by typhoon using remote sensing technique (2007), pp. 3022-3026. , In: Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2007.

This study examines the surge event in New York Harbor using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) atmospheric model and the Coupled-Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave- Sediment Transport / Regional Ocean Modeling System (COAWST/ROMS). We present a new technique using directional analysis to calculate and display maps of a coastline's potential for storm surge; these maps are constructed from wind fields blowing from eight fixed compass directions. This analysis approximates the surge observed during Hurricane Sandy. The directional analysis is then applied to surge events at Charleston, South Carolina, New Orleans, Louisiana, and Tacloban City, the Philippines.

Rising sea-levels and increased storminess threaten to accelerate coastal erosion, while growing demand for coastal real estate encourages more spending to hold back the sea in spite of the shrinking federal budget for beach nourishment. As climatic drivers and federal policies for beach nourishment change, the evolution of coastline mitigation and property values is uncertain. We develop an empirically grounded, stochastic dynamic model coupling coastal property markets and shoreline evolution, including beach nourishment, and show that a large share of coastal property value reflects capitalized erosion control. The model is parameterized for coastal properties and physical forcing in North Carolina, U.S.A. and we conduct sensitivity analyses using property values spanning a wide range of sandy coastlines along the U.S. East Coast. The model shows that a sudden removal of federal nourishment subsidies, as has been proposed, could trigger a dramatic downward adjustment in coastal real estate, analogous to the bursting of a bubble. We find that the policy-induced inflation of property value grows with increased erosion from sea level rise or increased storminess, but the effect of background erosion is larger due to human behavioral feedbacks. Our results suggest that if nourishment is not a long-run strategy to manage eroding coastlines, a gradual removal is more likely to smooth the transition to more climate-resilient coastal communities. © 2015 McNamara et al.",,"Culliton, T.J., Population: Distribution, density and growth (1998) NOAA's State of the Coast Report, , Silver Spring, MD: NOAA; Gopalakrishnan, S., Smith, M.D., Slott, J.M., Murray, A.B., The value of disappearing beaches: A hedonic pricing model with endogenous beach width (2011) Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 61 (3), pp. 297-310; Valverde, H.R., Trembanis, A.C., Pilkey, O.H., Summary of beach nourishment episodes on the US east coast barrier islands (1999) Journal of Coastal Research, pp. 1100-1118; (2006) Beach Nourishment.

The Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Katrina Inspired Disaster Screenings (KIDS) is a model designed with the goal of assisting recovering communities in understanding the needs of and targeting services toward children and adolescents.Objective: As a critical, yet understudied, component to the KIDS model, the objective of this study is to test the psychometric properties of the National Child Traumatic Stress Network Hurricane Assessment and Referral Tool for Children and Adolescents.Methods: Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to investigate the factor structure of the NCTSN Hurricane Assessment and Referral Tool. The convenience sample included 7530, 9–18 years old students who completed the school initiated screener in Southeastern Louisiana schools from December 2005 to December 2006. On a small treatment seeking population (N = 62), associations among the referral tool and the PTSD Reaction Index were also explored.Results: EFA of the referral tool revealed a two factor solution, anxious and depressive reactions, that accounted for 45.8 % of model variance.

What accounts for these dissimilarities, and are the roles expected of governments and societies to mitigate loss of life and physical devastation different across political systems and countries? This article examines etiologies of hurricane destruction advanced by political rulers and public opinion leaders in Mexico and Cuba. Reports in the Spanish-language printed media provide evidence of the types of critiques made by Mexican and Cuban leaders of the USA’s mismanagement of disaster response to hurricane Katrina. How they assessed their own country’s management of hurricane Wilma’s destruction is also analyzed. A key theoretical question which the article addresses is whether the effectiveness of hurricane responses depends on the state’s capacity, including social capital, public policy priorities, social values, and quality of leadership. Explanations are offered and factors identified as to why a state with massive resources and broad legitimacy like the USA responded ineffectively to Katrina while the Cuban government with limited resources and much less legitimacy performed effectively in managing Wilma. In turn, how did the first post-Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) government in 70 years with limited experience and neoliberal values manage its hurricane Wilma crisis? © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Capitalism; Cuba; Disaster management; Emergency management; Emergency response; Hurricanes; Ideology; Katrina; Media; Mexico; Natural disasters; New Orleans; Political institutions; Political legitimacy; Press; Public policy; Race; Social values; State capacity; Wilma",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925262638

The storm weakened as it passed over South China Sea (SCS) and made landfall in Hong Kong as a category 1 typhoon on 22 August. Despite the storm’s modest strength, the change in typhoon Nuri’s intensity was unique in that it strongly depended on the upper ocean. This study examines the ocean response to typhoon Nuri using the Princeton Ocean Model. An ocean state accounting for the sea-surface temperature (SST) and mesoscale eddy field prior to Nuri was constructed by assimilating satellite SST and altimetry data 12 days before the storm. The simulation then continued without further data assimilation, so that the ocean response to the strong wind can be used to understand processes. It is found that the SST cooling was biased to the right of the storm’s track due to inertial currents that rotated in the same sense as the wind vector, as has previously been found in the literature. However, despite the comparable wind speeds while the storm was in western Pacific and SCS, the SST cooling was much more intense in SCS. The reason was because in SCS, the surface layer was thinner, the vorticity field of the Kuroshio was cyclonic, and moreover a combination of larger Coriolis frequency as the storm moved northward and the typhoon’s slower translational speed produced a stronger resonance between wind and current, resulting in strong shears and entrainment of cool subsurface waters in the upper ocean. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Inertial currents; Near-inertial internal waves; Resonance between wind and ocean current; South China Sea; Typhoon Nuri; Upper ocean response; Western North Pacific Ocean",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925250276

However, the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) ocean color data reveal that the Gulf of Aden also exhibits a prominent summer chlorophyll bloom and sustains elevated chlorophyll concentrations throughout the fall, and is a biophysical province distinct from the adjacent Arabian Sea. Climatological hydrographic data suggest that the thermocline, hence the nutricline, in the entire gulf is markedly shoaled by the southwest monsoon during summer and fall. Under this condition, cyclonic eddies in the gulf can effectively pump deep nutrients to the surface layer and lead to the chlorophyll bloom in late summer, and, after the transition to the northeast monsoon in fall, coastal upwelling driven by the northeasterly winds produces a pronounced increase in surface chlorophyll concentrations along the Somali coast. © 2015 Yao, Hoteit.",,"Wiggert, J.D., Hood, R.R., Banse, K., Kindle, J.C., Monsoon-driven biogeochemical processes in the Arabian Sea (2005) Progress in Oceanography, 65, pp. 176-213; Levy, M., Shankar, D., Andre, J.M., Shenoi, S.S.C., Durand, F., De Boyer Montégut, C., Basin-wide seasonal evolution of the Indian Ocean's phytoplankton blooms (2007) Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans, 112; Almogi-Labina, A., Schmiedl, G., Hemleben, C., Siman-Tov, R., Segl, M., Meischner, D., The influence of the NE winter monsoon on productivity changes in the Gulf of Aden, NW Arabian Sea, during the last 530 ka as recorded by foraminifera (2000) Marine Micropaleontology, 40, pp. 295-319; Van Couwelaar, M., Zooplankton and micronekton biomass off Somalia and in the southern Red Sea during the SW monsoon of 1992 and the NE monsoon of 1993 (1997) Deep-Sea Research Part II-Topical Studies in Oceanography, 44, pp. 1213-1234; Resplandy, L., Levy, M., Madec, G., Pous, S., Aumont, O., Kumar, D., Contribution of mesoscale processes to nutrient budgets in the Arabian Sea (2011) Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans, 116; Bower, A.S., Furey, H.H., Mesoscale eddies in the Gulf of Aden and their impact on the spreading of Red Sea Outflow Water (2012) Progress in Oceanography, 96, pp. 14-39; Wilson, C., Adamec, D., A global view of bio-physical coupling from SeaWiFS and TOPEX satellite data, 1997-2001 (2002) Geophysical Research Letters, 29; Aiki, H., Takahashi, K., Yamagata, T., The Red Sea outflow regulated by the Indian monsoon (2006) Continental Shelf Research, 26, pp. 1448-1468; Yao, F., Hoteit, I., Pratt, L.J., Bower, A.S., Zhai, P., Gopalakrishnan, G., Seasonal overturning circulation in the Red Sea: 1.

Findings indicate that hypothetical disasters induce stronger reactions than those experienced in the natural world, as Hurricane Katrina bystanders imagine themselves incurring much higher damages, and being much less likely to return to live in their hurricane-damaged homes, than actual Hurricane Katrina evacuees. Ultimately, respondents considering a hypothetical low-probability, high-consequence event exhibit exaggerated beliefs and opposite decisions of those who actually lived through one of these events.

Previous work provides little insight into the decision-making process around evacuation. This study was conducted to identify factors that most heavily influenced the decisions to evacuate the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) New York Harbor Healthcare System’s (NYHHS; New York USA) Manhattan Campus before Hurricane Irene in 2011 and before Superstorm Sandy in 2012.Methods: Semi-structured interviews with 11 senior leaders were conducted on the processes and factors that influenced the evacuation decisions prior to each event.Results: The most influential factor in the decision to evacuate the Manhattan Campus before Hurricane Irene was New York City’s (NYC’s) hospital-evacuation mandate. As a federal facility, the Manhattan VA medical center (VAMC) was exempt from the city’s order, but decision makers felt compelled to comply. In the case of Superstorm Sandy, corporate memory of a similar 1992 storm that crippled the Manhattan facility drove the decision to evacuate before the storm hit.Conclusions: Results suggest that hospital-evacuation decisions are confounded by political considerations and are influenced by past disaster experience. Greater shared situational awareness among at-risk hospitals, along with a more coordinated approach to evacuation decision making, could reduce pressure on hospitals to make these high-stakes decisions. Systematic mechanisms for collecting, documenting, and sharing lessons learned from past disasters are sorely needed at the institutional, local, and national levels.Ricci KA , Griffin AR , Heslin KC , Kranke D , Dobalian A .

For patients with complex needs and for nearby hospitals already strained by high volume, disaster-related hospital closures induce a public health emergency. Our objective was to analyze responses of patients from public versus private emergency departments after closure of their usual hospital after Hurricane Sandy. Using a statewide database of emergency visits, we followed patients with an established pattern of accessing 1 of 2 hospitals that closed after Hurricane Sandy: Bellevue Hospital Center and NYU Langone Medical Center. We determined how these patients redistributed for emergency care after the storm. We found that proximity strongly predicted patient redistribution to nearby open hospitals. However, for patients from the closed public hospital, this redistribution was also influenced by hospital ownership, because patients redistributed to other public hospitals at rates higher than expected by proximity alone. This differential response to hospital closures demonstrates significant differences in how public and private patients respond to changes in health care access during disasters. Public health response must consider these differences to meet the needs of all patients affected by disasters and other public health emergencies.

For this purpose, a coupled ADCIRC and SWAN model was applied based on multiple scenario-based, deterministic model runs for each time-varying meteorological forecast advisory on a relatively lightweight mesh with 57 k nodes covering the North Western Pacific (NWP) ocean. The mesh was designed to achieve an optimal combination of speed and accuracy on a cost-effective parallel computer with 64 cores. These models were applied for two events in 2012: typhoon Bolaven (on the west coast of Korea) and typhoon Sanba (on the south coast of Korea). The surge results for a 72-h forecast yielded relative surge height error of 34.1 to 46.4 % in ADCIRC + SWAN. The surge results from a meteorological forecast 24 h from landfall improved to 21.7 to 26.8 %. Furthermore, surge elevation results progressively approached measured values (i.e., improved) with each successive typhoon advisory owing to diminishing uncertainties in the meteorological input. In conclusion, this new efficient early warning forecast guidance workflow successfully achieved its goals of real-time storm surge simulations for forecasters, early warning, and understanding of ocean dynamics. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Coastal hazard; Surge height; Time-varying deterministic; Typhoon advisory",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924692435

The area coverage of tropical cyclones influences their impact on human lives, yet little is known about how tropical cyclone rainfall area will change in the future. Here, using satellite data and global atmospheric model simulations, we show that tropical cyclone rainfall area is controlled primarily by its environmental sea surface temperature (SST) relative to the tropical mean SST (that is, the relative SST), while rainfall rate increases with increasing absolute SST. Our result is consistent with previous numerical simulations that indicated tight relationships between tropical cyclone size and mid-tropospheric relative humidity. Global statistics of tropical cyclone rainfall area are not expected to change markedly under a warmer climate provided that SST change is relatively uniform, implying that increases in total rainfall will be confined to similar size domains with higher rainfall rates. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Based on event analysis, this study investigates the effects of unexpected climatic events that have occurred in the country and abroad on the Chinese stock market. The sample includes 21 indices according to industry from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in China. The effects of climatic events that occurred in China and the USA on the Chinese stock market are compared. Results show that meteorological disasters (i.e., the snow storm in 2008 and strong tropical storm in 2011 in China, as well as the hurricane in 2005 and the snow storm in 2006 in the USA) have significant effects on the Chinese stock market. Moreover, the influences of these disasters on the Chinese stock market are different. The unexpected domestic climatic events have a greater effect on the volatility of the Chinese stock market than those that occurred in the USA. The same climatic event can have different effects on various industries, whereas different climatic events can have different effects on the same industry in China. Moreover, the manner in which these events influence industries may change in the future. We find that the magnitude of the effect on each industry depends on the sensitivity of the industries to the unexpected climatic events. Finally, several reasonable recommendations are proposed. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Climatic events; Disaster; Event analysis; Stock market volatility",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924347283

However, there are few empirical studies that seek to quantify the uncertainty and establish confidence intervals surrounding natural disaster cost estimates (ex post). To better frame the data limitations associated with natural disaster loss estimates, a range of losses can be evaluated by conducting multiple analyses and varying certain input parameters to which the losses are most sensitive. This paper contributes to the literature by examining new approaches for better understanding the uncertainty surrounding three US natural disaster cost estimate case studies, via Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the 95, 90 and 75 % confidence intervals. This research also performs a sensitivity analysis for one of the case studies examining which input data variables and assumptions are the most sensitive and contribute most to the overall uncertainty of the estimate. The Monte Carlo simulations for all three of the natural disaster events examined provide additional confidence in the US billion-dollar weather and climate disaster loss estimate report (NCDC 2014), since these estimates are within the confidence limits and near the mean and median of the example simulations. The normalized sensitivity analysis of Hurricane Ike damage costs determined that commercial losses in Texas are the most sensitive to assumption variability. Therefore, improvements in quantifying the commercial insurance participation rate for Texas will result in the largest reduction of uncertainty in the total loss estimate for Hurricane Ike. Further minimization of uncertainty would continue with improved measurement of subsequent cost parameters in order of descending sensitivity. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Costs; Losses; Natural disasters; Sensitivity; Statistics of extreme events; Uncertainty",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924386274

We combine this new sampling scheme with the conventional direct volume rendering mode, iso-surface mode, and the cutting plane mode to support interactive inspection of volumetric distributions of multiple variables.

Here we present continuous δ18O and δ2H data in rainfall and water vapour, as well as in discrete rainfall samples, during the passage of TC Ita and relate the evolution in isotopic compositions to local and synoptic scale meteorological observations. High-resolution data revealed a close relationship between isotopic compositions and cyclonic features such as spiral rainbands, periods of stratiform rainfall and the arrival of subtropical and tropical air masses with changing oceanic and continental moisture sources. The isotopic compositions in discrete rainfall samples were remarkably constant along the ~450 km overland path of the cyclone when taking into account the direction and distance to the eye of the cyclone at each sampling time. Near simultaneous variations in δ18O and δ2H values in rainfall and vapour and a near-equilibrium rainfall-vapour isotope fractionation indicates strong isotopic exchange between rainfall and surface inflow of vapour during the approach of the cyclone. In contrast, after the passage of spiral rainbands close to the eye of the cyclone, different moisture sources for rainfall and vapour are reflected in diverging d-excess values. High-resolution isotope studies of modern TCs refine the interpretation of stable isotope signatures found in speleothems and other paleo archives and should aim to further investigate the influence of cyclone intensity and longevity on the isotopic composition of associated rainfall. © 2015 Munksgaard et al.",,"Nott, J., Haig, J., Neil, H., Greater frequency variability of land falling tropical cyclones at centennial compared to seasonal and decadal scales (2007) Earth and Planet.

Individual-level factors such as age may also contribute to a disaster’s impact on mental health, though it is unclear whether young age confers a protective effect or represents a period of increased risk as compared to adulthood.Objective: The present study evaluated the influence of adolescent age and hurricane experiences on mental health in the years following multiple hurricanes in the New Orleans region.Methods: 794 women, currently aged 18–45, participating in a cohort study of lifetime adversity and reproductive health completed a survey about hurricane experience and current mental health. Joint associations between disaster experience and age at the time of disaster on depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated.Results: Compared to women who were adults at the time of the disaster, being in early adolescence resulted in reduced depression and PTSD up to 9-years post-disaster, controlling for hurricane experiences, time since disaster, and income. A similar effect was not observed among older adolescents. Increased endorsement of feeling one’s life was in danger and experiencing illness or injury resulted in increased odds of depression, while danger was associated with increased odds of PTSD.Conclusions: Younger age at the time of a natural disaster may confer a protective effect on mental health outcomes post-disaster, even when disaster experiences are considered, potentially representing the importance of parental support and cognitive development on disaster effects. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Adolescence; Disaster experience; Hurricane; Mental health",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924099732

Eventually, TC simulations can be conducted at Large Eddy Simulation (LES) resolution, which requires Δx to fall in the inertial subrange (often <102 m) to adequately resolve the large, energy-containing eddies. Between the two lies the so-called ""terra incognita"" because some of the assumptions used by mesoscale models and LES to treat BL turbulence are invalid. This study performs several 4-6 h simulations of Hurricane Katrina (2005) without a BL parameterization at extremely fine Δx [333, 200, and 111 m, hereafter ""Large Eddy Permitting (LEP) runs""] and compares with mesoscale simulations with BL parameterizations (Δx = 3 km, 1 km, and 333 m, hereafter ""PBL runs""). There are profound differences in the hurricane BL structure between the PBL and LEP runs: the former have a deeper inflow layer and secondary eyewall formation, whereas the latter have a shallow inflow layer without a secondary eyewall. Among the LEP runs, decreased Δx yields weaker subgrid-scale vertical momentum fluxes, but the sum of subgrid-scale and ""grid-scale"" fluxes remain similar. There is also evidence that the size of the prevalent BL eddies depends upon Δx, suggesting that convergence to true LES has not yet been reached. Nevertheless, the similarities in the storm-scale BL structure among the LEP runs indicate that the net effect of the BL on the rest of the hurricane may be somewhat independent of Δx. © 2015.

Large-eddy simulations (LESs) were conducted to explicitly resolve the organized roll vortices in the HBL over the ocean using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The LESs were nested within the WRF mesoscale model to provide two-way up-scale and down-scale exchange at the nest interfaces, and explicitly resolve large eddies. Downdrafts in the organized roll vortices correspond to transport of high-momentum air down to the surface, while updrafts tend to transport low-momentum air upwards. The downdrafts and updrafts therefore lead to a well-organized band-like structure of alternating strong and relatively weak near-surface winds, respectively. The upward legs of the roll vortices are also associated with transport of moist air to the upper levels, while drier air is brought down to the surface in the downward legs. Organized roll vortices contribute a significant portion to the vertical transport of heat and moisture. Three planetary boundary-layer (PBL) parametrizations were examined against the LES. Results indicate that PBL parametrizations cannot capture the band-like structure of alternating strong and relatively weak near-surface winds as they are subgrid scale features, and are unable to adequately represent the surface heat fluxes and wind profiles in the hurricane conditions. PBL parametrizations show overall less variability in the extremes of the wind field. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Hurricane boundary layer; Large-eddy simulation; Organized roll vortices; Planetary boundary layer","Alizadeh Choobari, O., Zawar-Reza, P., Sturman, A., Feedback between windblown dust and planetary boundary-layer characteristics: sensitivity to boundary and surface layer parameterizations (2012) Atmos.

In this paper, a proactive resource allocation model for repair and restoration of potential damages to the power system infrastructure located on the path of an upcoming hurricane is proposed. The objective is to develop an efficient framework for system operators to minimize potential damages to power system components in a cost-effective manner. The problem is modeled as a stochastic integer program with complete recourse. The large-scale mixed-integer equivalence of the original model is solved by the Benders' decomposition method to handle computation burden. The standard IEEE 118-bus system is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and further discuss its merits. © 2015 IEEE.","Hurricane planning; power system resiliency; resource allocation; stochastic program with recourse","Winkler, J., Duenas-Osorio, L., Stein, R., Subramanian, D., Performance assessment of topologically diverse power systems subjected to hurricane events (2010) Rel.

A Teledyne-Webb Slocum glider, equipped with a Nortek Aquadopp current profiler, was deployed on the continental shelf ahead of the storm, and is used to validate sediment transport routines coupled to the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The glider was deployed on 25 October, 5 days before Sandy made landfall in southern New Jersey (NJ) and flew along the 40 m isobath south of the Hudson Shelf Valley. We used optical and acoustic backscatter to compare with two modeled size classes along the glider track, 0.1 and 0.4 mm sand, respectively. Observations and modeling revealed full water column resuspension for both size classes for over 24 h during peak waves and currents, with transport oriented along-shelf toward the southwest. Regional model predictions showed over 3 cm of sediment eroded on the northern portion of the NJ shelf where waves and currents were the highest. As the storm passed and winds reversed from onshore to offshore on the southern portion of the domain waves and subsequently orbital velocities necessary for resuspension were reduced leading to over 3 cm of deposition across the entire shelf, just north of Delaware Bay. This study highlights the utility of gliders as a new asset in support of the development and verification of regional sediment resuspension and transport models, particularly during large tropical and extratropical cyclones when in situ data sets are not readily available. © 2015.

While coastal ocean hydrodynamic models like ADCIRC may be used to assess the extent of inundation, the computational cost may be prohibitive since many local changes corresponding to design and failure scenarios would ideally be considered. We present an exact reanalysis technique and corresponding implementation that enable the assessment of local subdomain changes with less computational effort than would be required by a complete resimulation of the full domain. So long as the subdomain is large enough to fully contain the altered hydrodynamics, changes may be made and simulations performed within it without the need to calculate new boundary values. Accurate results are obtained even when subdomain boundary conditions are forced only intermittently, and convergence is demonstrated by progressively increasing the frequency at which they are applied. Descriptions of the overall methodology, performance results, and accuracy, as well as case studies, are presented. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","ADCIRC; Hurricane; Storm surge; Subdomain modeling","Altuntas, A., (2012) Downscaling Storm Surge Models for Engineering Applications, , (Master's thesis), North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC; Altuntas, A., Simon, J.S., Baugh, J.W., Subdomain ADCIRC v. 50 User Guide (2013) Technical Report, , North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, (CE-308-13); Arora, J., Survey of structural reanalysis techniques (1976) J.

Historical landfall counts in piecewise-linear segments approximating the coastline are modeled using Poisson regression with spatial random effects. Predictors include index representations of the mean hurricane-season phases of the Southern Oscillation, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, and the North Atlantic Oscillation, with the effect of the latter also modeled spatially. This spatial generalized linear model for landfall frequency is used in conjunction with a data level accounting explicitly for the time-dependent uncertainty in the recorded landfall positions. The model performs skillfully in cross-validation exercises. The inferred effects of the climatic predictors are also consistent with current scientific understanding of the mechanisms through which related large-scale climatic variability affects the development and motion of Atlantic tropical cyclones. Sampling variability in the data over the short length of the observational record and observational error in the historical data are found to contribute substantially to the overall climatological uncertainty. The contribution from uncertainty in the underlying model parameters is negligible compared to these other sources. The model presented here could be used for applications in insurance and risk management, and adaptations could also be used to investigate changes in TC landfall climatology under an uncertain and changing climate. © 2015.

The 2010 Haiti earthquake occasioned a SV epidemic in Cité Soleil, where over 50% of females are reportedly victims of SV via non-intimate partners/strangers (NPSV). Little is known about the psychological effects of SV perpetrated by NPSV; even less in known about the biopsychosocial consequences of NPSV on women in Haiti. Yet, the World Health Organization recently called for research on NPSV, particularly in poor and disaster-affected countries.Methods: As a first step in categorizing the consequences of NPSV on female victims in Haiti, we conducted 2 focus groups of 16 female residents of Cité Soleil who survived the earthquake and its aftershocks, along with ensuing hurricanes and cholera.Results: Participants reported rapes by strangers who intentionally ""crush the uterus."" All endorsed criteria for PTSD, including enduring physiological, neurological and psychological symptoms: significant intrusive, avoidance, arousal, cognitive, mood changes, as well as significant distress/impairment in various areas of functioning; and all but one became pregnant from the experience. All denied substance use and other illness that is not associated with the sexual violence.Limitations: Our study was exploratory, targeting a small sample of women in one specific neighborhood and cannot be generalized to all SV victims in Haiti.Conclusions: Following earthquakes, there should be vigilance by public health officials and rescue teams for prevention of SV against women. Women who survive SV in Haiti should be provided access to trauma-informed care that addresses biological consequences of the SV, as well as biological, neurological and psychological sequelae. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that the structure and magnitude of the wind field (and the corresponding secondary circulation) depends sensitively on the radial gradient of the gradient wind field above the boundary layer. Furthermore, it is shown that vortex translation creates low wave number asymmetries in the wind field that rotate anticyclonically with height. A budget analysis of the steady state wind field for both models was also performed in this study. Although the agradient force drives the evolution of the boundary layer wind field for both models, it is shown that the manner in which the boundary layer flow responds to this force differs between the two model representations. In particular, the inner core boundary layer flow in the slab model is dominated by the effects of horizontal advection and horizontal diffusion, leading to the development of shock structures in the model. Conversely, the inner core boundary layer flow in the multilevel model is primarily influenced by the effects of vertical advection and vertical diffusion, which eliminates shock structures in this model. These results further indicate that special care is required to ensure that qualitative applications from slab models are not unduly affected by the neglect of vertical advection. © 2014.

By using the WSR-88D radar network and gauge data sets across the conterminous US, an investigation of this subject has been carried out within the framework of the NOAA/NSSL ground radar-based Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) QPE system. A new method is proposed and called PRORATE for probabilistic QPE using radar observations of rate and typology estimates. Probability distributions of precipitation rates are computed instead of deterministic values using a model quantifying the relation between radar reflectivity and the corresponding ""true"" precipitation. The model acknowledges the uncertainty arising from many factors operative at the radar measurement scale and from the correction algorithm. Ensembles of reflectivity-to-precipitation rate relationships accounting explicitly for precipitation typology were derived at a 5 min/1 km scale. This approach conditions probabilistic quantitative precipitation estimates (PQPE) on the precipitation rate and type. The model components were estimated on the basis of a 1 year long data sample over the CONUS. This PQPE model provides the basis for precipitation probability maps and the generation of radar precipitation ensembles. Maps of the precipitation exceedance probability for specific thresholds (e.g., precipitation return periods) are computed. Precipitation probability maps are accumulated to the hourly time scale and compare favorably to the deterministic QPE. As an essential property of precipitation, the impact of the temporal correlation on the hourly accumulation is examined. This approach to PQPE can readily apply to other systems including space-based passive and active sensor algorithms. © 2015. American Geophysical Union.

The first is to point out and correct several misconceptions about the putative WISHE mechanism of tropical cyclone intensification that currently are being taught to atmospheric science students, to tropical weather forecasters, and to laypeople who seek to understand how tropical cyclones intensify. The mechanism relates to the simplest problem of an initial cyclonic vortex in a quiescent environment. This first part is important because the credibility of tropical cyclone science depends inter alia on being able to articulate a clear and consistent picture of the hypothesized intensification process and its dependencies on key flow parameters. The credibility depends also on being able to test the hypothesized mechanisms using observations, numerical models, or theoretical analyses. The second purpose of the paper is to carry out new numerical experiments using a state-of-the-art numerical model to test a recent hypothesis invoking the WISHE feedback mechanism during the rapid intensification phase of a tropical cyclone. The results obtained herein, in conjunction with prior work, do not support this recent hypothesis and refute the view that the WISHE intensification mechanism is the essential mechanism of tropical cyclone intensification in the idealized problem that historically has been used to underpin the paradigm. This second objective is important because it presents a simple way of testing the hypothesized intensification mechanism and shows that the mechanism is neither essential nor the dominant mode of intensification for the prototype intensification problem. In view of the operational, societal, and scientific interest in the physics of tropical cyclone intensification, we believe this paper will be of broad interest to the atmospheric science community and the findings should be useful in both the classroom setting and frontier research. © 2014.

The wind speed was recorded by multiple sonic and vane anemometers near the seashore of an island. Only stationary wind speed samples are analyzed to obtain the gust factor. The study focuses on the dependences of gust factor on gust averaging time, sample duration, and mean wind speed during the typhoon's passage. The results suggest that typhoon gust factors have no significant difference from those associated with non-typhoon winds, and can be described using models developed for standard neutral boundary layer flow conditions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Gust averaging time; Gust factor; Sample duration; Typhoon","Ashcroft, J., The relationship between the gust ratio, terrain roughness, gust duration and the hourly mean wind speed (1994) J.

The flood control process is divided into three stages: (1) before flood (Stage I); (2) before peak flow (Stage II); and (3) after peak flow (Stage III). The models are then constructed with either three phase modules (ANFIS-3P and RTRLNN-3P) or two phase (Stage I. +. II and Stage III) modules (ANFIS-2P and RTRLNN-2P). The multi-phase modules are developed with consideration of the difference in operational decision mechanisms, decision information, release functions, and targets between each flood control stage to solve the problem of time-consuming computation and difficult system integration of MILP. In addition, the model inputs include the coupled short lead time and total reservoir inflow forecast information that are developed using radar- and satellite-based meteorological monitoring techniques, forecasted typhoon tracks, meteorological image similarity analysis, ANFIS and RTRLNN. This study uses the Tseng-Wen Reservoir basin as the study area, and the model results showed that RTRLNN outperformed ANFIS in the simulated outcomes from the optimized hydrographs. This study also applies the models to Typhoons Kalmaegi and Morakot to compare the simulations to historical operations. From the operation results, the RTRLNN-3P model is better than RTRLNN-2P and historical operations. Further, because the RTRLNN-3P model combines the innovative multi-phase module with monitored and forecasted decision information, the operation can simultaneously, effectively and automatically achieve the dual goals of flood detention at peak flow periods and water supply at the end of a typhoon event. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System; Multi-phase flood control module; Optimization; Real-Time Recurrent Learning Neural Network; Reservoir inflow forecast; Reservoir real-time flood operation","Aqil, M., Kita, I., Yano, A., Nishiyama, S., Neural networks for real time catchment flow modeling and prediction (2007) Water Resour.

While C-band ScanSAR images have been demonstrated to be well suitable for wind retrievals, ocean wave retrievals are a more challenging problem: Because of the limited spatial resolution of 100 m (RADARSAT) / 150 m (Envisat), only long waves can get imaged directly, and many images of tropical storm scenarios do not exhibit clear signatures of any waves in large areas. The interpretation of wave patterns that exist in an image is difficult because of the imaging mechanism's nonlinearities. We think we have found a promising new technique for wave parameter retrievals from C-band ScanSAR images, which determines peak wavelengths and directions from image spectra where possible but uses an empirically determined relation to estimate significant wave heights (SWHs) from local mean image intensities, which is similar to the method used for wind retrievals. This way, it is possible to obtain SWH estimates for the entire image and to account for the contributions of subresolution-scale waves. We explain how the algorithm works and how the empirical SWH model function has been determined from a set of hurricane images from RADARSAT-1 and reference wave spectra from a numerical wave model. The first independent test with a set of RADARSAT-2 and Envisat images from the 2010 Impact of Typhoons on the Ocean in the Pacific (ITOP) experiment reveals a few weaknesses but essentially confirms the feasibility of the concept. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Image analysis; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR); Waves; Wind","Alpers, W., Ross, D.B., Rufenach, C.L., On the detectability of ocean surface waves by real and synthetic aperture radar (1981) J.

By integrating advantages of all three methods, we present a multidisciplinary approach to trace the provenance of dust fall in Xi'an during the spring season (March to May) of 2012. We collected daily dust fall to calculate dust flux variation, and detected eight DS events with remarkable high flux values based on meteorological comparison and extreme detection algorithm. By combining MODIS images and accompanying real-time air mass back trajectories, we attribute four of them as natural DS events and the other four as anthropogenic DS events, suggesting the importance of natural and anthropogenic processes in supplying long-range transported dust. The primary sources of these DS events were constrained to three possible areas, including the northern Chinese deserts, Taklimakan desert, and Gurbantunggut desert. Proxy comparisons based upon the quartz crystallinity index and oxygen isotope further confirmed the source-to-sink linkage between the natural DS events in Xi'an and the dust emissions from the northern Chinese deserts. The integration of geochemical and meteorological tracing approaches favors the dominant contribution of short-distance transportation of modern dust fall on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Our study shows that the multidisciplinary approach could permit a better source identification of modern dust and should be applied properly for tracing the provenance fluctuations of geological dust deposits. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Back trajectory analysis; Dust storm; Proxy comparison; Satellite image; Source tracing","Ackerman, S.A., Remote sensing aerosols using satellite infrared observations (1997) J.Geophys.

These efforts have largely consisted of laboratory and numerical simulations using both impinging jets and thermodynamic-allowing models, while full-scale observations have remained fairly sparse. The limited body of research has illustrated significant differences between the mean characteristics of thunderstorm outflow winds and ""standard"" boundary layer winds, yet the evolution of the wind profiles remains poorly understood. Using high-resolution full-scale data collected with two mobile Doppler radars, this research provides a deeper understanding of the evolutionary characteristics of thunderstorm outflow winds and wind profile data. The unique scanning strategy that enables the collection of the dual-Doppler wind profiles also allows for the analysis of the vertical structure of the outflow. Three outflow events are investigated with particular emphasis place on the profile evolution and driving meteorology of each event. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Profile evolution; Radar observations; Thunderstorm outflow; Wind profiles","Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures (2010), ASCE/SEI 7-10, Reston, VAAshley, W.S., Mote, T.L., Derecho hazards in the United States (2005) Bull.

This study presents a comprehensive comparison of the CHOS molecular formulas of rainwater dissolved organic matter from these two different storm trajectories. There were 899 and 695 total molecular formula assignments in the continental and coastal storms respectively. Of these, 33% and 15% were unique to continental and coastal storms. Kendrick mass analysis of methylene units highlighted oligomers present in both storm types illustrating their ubiquitous occurrence in atmospheric waters. There was also evidence of organo-sulfate containing molecular formulas as well as highly condensed aromatic structures containing one sulfur and one oxygen.

Data were taken from the Cosmos-1809 and Intercosmos Bulgaria-1300 satellites, which passed over several dozen TCs. The first stage of TC development consists of a sharp increase in altitudinal substorm activity caused by a tropical disturbance and depression. During this stage, plasma density caverns extending over several hundreds of kilometers are observed in the nighttime upper ionosphere a day before the formation of a tropical storm or even a category-I hurricane. The second stage, typical of TCs with intensities reaching categories I and II, is the displacement of a wide plasma density maximum in the upper ionosphere from the geomagnetic equator into the region, the center of which along the geomagnetic field line is projected to 200–230 km altitudes at a TC latitude. The third stage, which is typical of TC categories III–V, consists of the formation of an additional Ne peak (with a width reaching 1000 km) near the TC zenith. This peak includes ΔNe disturbances and is accompanied by electrostatic oscillations at the H+ and He+ cyclotron frequencies and at the lower hybrid resonance frequency and by electric fields that are projected into the magnetically conjugate region. The crossing of New Caledonia by the category-IV TC Harry was considered in detail. It was shown that the neutral particle ascending jet probably deviated along the meridian in this case. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,"Aburjania, G.D., Kharshiladze, O.A., Chargazia, K.Z., Self-organization of IGW structures in an inhomogeneous ionosphere: 2.

The maximum surface (0-500m) 137Cs air concentrations would be reached 10Bqm-3 near the source, comparable to the Fukushima case. In January, Southeast Asian countries would be mostly affected by the radioactive plume due to the effects of winter monsoon. In April, the impact would be mainly on Southern and Northern China. Debris of radioactive plume (~1mBqm-3) would carry out long-range transport to North America. The area of influence would be the smallest in July due to the frequent and intense wet removal events by trough of low pressure and tropical cyclone. The maximum worst-case areas of influence were 2382000, 2327000, 517000 and 1395000km2 in January, April, July and October, respectively.Prior to the above calculations, the model was employed to simulate the trans-oceanic transport of 137Cs from the Fukushima nuclear accident. Observed and modeled 137Cs concentrations were comparable. Sensitivity runs were performed to optimize the wet scavenging parameterization. The adoption of higher-resolution (1°×1°) meteorological fields improved the prediction. The computed large-scale plume transport pattern over the Pacific Ocean was compared with that reported in the literature. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Fukushima accident; Future impact; Long-range transport; Numerical modeling; Radionuclide","Buesseler, K., Aoyama, M., Fukasawa, M., Impacts of the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plants on marine radioactivity source (2011) Environ.

To create the most effective hurricane evacuation map for communicating risk to the public, cartographic best practices must be integrated into the evacuation map visualization. This study addresses a current gap in the scientific literature by integrating cartographic best practices for color choice, symbol choice, and positive messaging, together with a complete GIS-based workflow utilizing LiDAR-derived digital elevation models, Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) storm surge products, and vector shapefiles for creating hurricane evacuation maps. To evaluate the methodology, the primary study site was Galveston County, Texas, during Hurricane Ike in September 2008. The typical workflow for county and municipal emergency managers is to create pre-hurricane season generalized evacuation maps. This study shows that the probabilistic storm surge SLOSH forecasts can be seamlessly implemented in the 72–48 hours prior to a storm surge event to provide specialized evacuation maps that incorporate hurricane-specific parameters and more accurately show risk to residents. To verify the Hurricane Ike workflow, a secondary study site in Harrison County, Mississippi, was used to evaluate Hurricane Isaac in August 2012. This study provides a comprehensive cartographic methodology for evacuation zone mapping when the US coastline is threatened by a landfalling hurricane. © 2015 Cartography and Geographic Information Society","coastal inundation; evacuation map; hurricane; Hurricane Ike; storm surge",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923267096

The field data such as wind speed, wind direction, structural acceleration and displacement responses were simultaneously recorded during the typhoon. Detailed analysis of the field data was conducted to investigate the wind field over an urban area, structural dynamic properties and wind-induced responses of the super-tall buildings. The typhoon-generated wind characteristics including turbulence intensity, gust factor and power spectral density of fluctuating wind speed were presented and discussed. The acceleration responses were analysed by Fourier transform to represent an averaged perspective over the records. Then, the wavelet transform was used to present time-frequency energy distributions of the structural vibrations. Instantaneous spectra were also presented for further discussions of the non-stationary signals. A high-pass Kaiser FIR digital filter was adopted to eliminate the multipath effects on the displacement responses recorded by global positioning system. Then, the resonant and background responses as well as their contributions to the total displacements were identified. Damping ratios of the high-rise structures were evaluated by the random decrement technique, which demonstrated amplitude-dependent characteristics. Finally, the serviceability performance of the super-tall buildings under wind actions with different return periods was estimated. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","dynamic characteristics; full-scale measurements; structural health monitoring; super-tall buildings; time-frequency analysis; typhoon; wavelet transform; wind-induced response",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923247020

Density of climbers apparently increases with the intervention rate (e.g. logging). The aim of this work is to characterize the structure, floristic composition and soils of a sector classified as Liana Forest (LF). We identified an LF sector in a not-logged area; three 1 ha square plots were measured (individuals ≥ 10 cm dbh, “diameter at breast height”). In each plot, we evaluate four 100 m2 square understory subplots (all spermatophyta individuals &lt; 10 cm dbh). LF has a low canopy ( &lt; 15 m) and is dominated by Alexa imperatricis and Pentaclethra macroloba. Basal area (20.4 m2ha− 1) and diversity (H′ = 2.6) are lower than other surrounding plots. Understory is dominated by gnarled climbers, and the most important are Cheiloclinium hippocrateoides and Bauhinia scala-simiae. Soil is extremely acidic, with very low fertility but is similar to neighboring places. We conclude that LF was neither originated by edaphic restrictions nor logging; LF probably suffered a hurricane wind that fell down most of the canopy trees, thick individuals of climber species also disappeared, and the current successional stage favors a recovery dominated with thin individuals of this life form. © 2015 Società Botanica Italiana","Climber; forest management; forest succession; Imataca; liana tangle",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923238276

Modern communication platforms, in particular online social networks, provide an opportunity to study such flow and derive early-warning sensors, thus improving emergency preparedness and response. Performance of the social networks sensor method, based on topological and behavioral properties derived from the ""friendship paradox"", is studied here for over 50 million Twitter messages posted before, during, and after Hurricane Sandy. We find that differences in users' network centrality effectively translate into moderate awareness advantage (up to 26 hours); and that geo-location of users within or outside of the hurricaneaffected area plays a significant role in determining the scale of such an advantage. Emotional response appears to be universal regardless of the position in the network topology, and displays characteristic, easily detectable patterns, opening a possibility to implement a simple ""sentiment sensing"" technique that can detect and locate disasters. © 2015 Kryvasheyeu et al.",,"Nelson, B., Natural disasters: A calculated risk (2013) Nature, 495, pp. 271-273. , PMID: 23495390;

This study evaluates the response of the freshwater lens on a small low-lying island to various stressors. To account for the varying temporal and spatial scales of the stressors, two different density-dependent flow and solute transport codes are used: SEAWAT (saturated) and HydroGeoSphere (unsaturated/saturated). The study site is Andros Island in the Bahamas, which is characteristic of other low-lying carbonate islands in the Caribbean and Pacific regions. In addition to projected sea level rise and reduced recharge under future climate change, Andros Island experienced a storm surge overwash event during Hurricane Francis in 2004, which contaminated the main wellfield. Simulations of reduced recharge result in a greater loss of freshwater lens volume (up to 19%), while sea level rise contributes a lower volume loss (up to 5%) due to the flux-controlled conceptualization of Andros Island, which limits the impact of sea level rise. Reduced recharge and sea level rise were simulated as incremental instantaneous shifts. The lens responds relatively quickly to these stressors, within 0.5 to 3 years, with response time increasing as the magnitude of the stressor increases. Simulations of the storm surge overwash indicate that the freshwater lens recovers over time; however, prompt remedial action can restore the lens to potable concentrations up to 1 month sooner. © Author(s) 2015.",,"Allen, D.M., Cannon, A.J., Toews, M.W., Scibek, J., Variability in simulated recharge using different GCMs (2010) Water Resour.

The motivation for this work came from the investigation of the islanding event in the Entergy, Louisiana power system in 2008. During Hurricane Gustav in September of 2008, 14 transmission lines were lost which led to the formation of a large electrical island containing much of Baton Rouge and New Orleans. This work proposes a method for identifying any specific area of the transmission system that is vulnerable to islanding as the result of losing a system branch. PMU measurements are then utilized to verify SCADA reports that a system branch has been lost. The proposed identification scheme is called the one line remaining (OLR) algorithm. The proposed algorithm identifies potential island formations based on the criteria that a single bus, or a number of buses, are connected to the rest of the system by only a single branch as a direct result of a branch outage. The OLR algorithm is detailed and applied to several small test systems to motivate and validate the approach. The OLR algorithm is then applied to a large Entergy test system for the Gustav islanding event and correctly identifies the last tie line that was lost and created the island.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923550432

Yet there is little research examining the mechanisms whereby some people are negatively affected by disasters whereas others are resilient to these negative effects. Family functioning and child characteristics might be factors that influence the impact of disasters on young children. We tested this premise in a sample of 118 children living in an area affected by a Category 3 hurricane, with 47 of these children participating before and after the hurricane. Results indicated that disaster experiences and emotion regulation are predictors of adjustment following natural disasters. Findings also suggested that the effects of disaster experiences on children’s adjustment are sometimes indirect through their impact on parental depression and parent hostility. Practice or Policy: These findings indicate that working to minimize the likelihood of parent–child separations during disasters could reduce the negative effects of disasters on children. In addition, promoting better emotional regulatory abilities in young children may help them to be more resilient when experiencing natural disasters, and providing parents with the support they need to more effectively parent may also decrease the likelihood that children will experience adjustment difficulties following disasters.

Results indicate that there are about 1.35 BOBTSs influence the TP in each year and most of them occurred in May and October, and the BOBTSs in AMJ influence the TP with larger extension and higher latitudes than those in SOND. The maximum regional precipitation induced by the BOBTSs accounts for more than 50% for the total precipitation in the corresponding month and about 20% for the season. Further analysis reveals that the surface soil moisture anomalies induced by the BOBTSs can persist only 20–25 days in AMJ, and the case is also true for the snow depth in SOND. Numerical simulations by using the regional climate model of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) suggest that the soil moisture anomalies in the sub-surface can last 2 months whereas for the surface it can persist only about 20 days, which agrees well with the observation analysis. Overall, the effect of the preceding BOBTSs on the snow depth and soil moisture anomalies over the TP cannot maintain to summer, and there is no robust connection between the BOBTSs and summer precipitation anomalies in East China. Moreover, since the mid-1990s, the spring rainfall induced by the BOBTSs over the TP seems to be enhanced to a certain degree because of the intensified BOBTSs. © 2015 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Bay of Bengal; snow depth; soil moisture; the Tibetan Plateau; tropical storms; WRF",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923025681

The JPM has become the preferred surge hazard assessment method in the USA; however, it has a high computational cost: One location can require hundreds of simulated storms and more than ten thousand computational hours to complete. Optimal sampling methods that use physics-based surge response functions (SRFs) can reduce the required number of simulations. This study extends the development of SRFs to bay interior locations at Panama City, Florida. Mean SRF root-mean-square errors for open coast and bay interior locations were 0.34 and 0.37 m, respectively, comparable with ADCIRC errors. Average uncertainty increases from open coast, and bay SRFs were 10 and 12 %, respectively. Long-term climate trends, such as rising sea levels, introduce nonstationarity into the simulated and historical surge datasets. A common approach to estimating total flood elevations is to take the sum of projected sea-level rise (SLR) and present day surge (static approach); however, this does not account for dynamic SLR effects on surge generation. This study demonstrates that SLR has a significant dynamic effect on surge in the Panama City area, and that total flood elevations, with respect to changes in SLR, are poorly characterized as static increases. A simple adjustment relating total flood elevation to present day conditions is proposed. Uncertainty contributions from these SLR adjustments are shown to be reasonable for surge hazard assessments. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Coastal flooding; Hazard assessment; Hurricanes; Storm surge; Uncertainty",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922709218

In the study, Hurricane Ike scenarios were modeled with SWAN + ADCIRC that involved changing the landfall location of the hurricane along the coast and incorporating the effect of increased wind speed. The storm surge data from the various landfall scenarios were cross-linked with geospatial and environmental data associated with facilities within the industrial region. This work uniquely combines the potential releases from storage tanks, records of past historical releases, and risk management planning to characterize environmental vulnerabilities using storage information and geospatial data. The resulting framework for vulnerability implemented within the HSC-IC found a relationship between storm surge and the total area inundated at a given storm surge level and between storm surge and the total number of storage tanks. Using the developed framework, it was possible to combine releases from storage tanks, records of past historical releases, and risk management planning to characterize environmental vulnerabilities on a facility by facility basis and for the modeled surge levels. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Environmental impact; GIS; Hurricane; Risk management",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922748415

Overwash has significant impacts on barrier island geomorphology: it represents a sediment pathway into island interiors, a component of island sediment budgets, and can cause considerable aggradation of backshore surfaces, important for potentially offsetting the effects of rising sea level. This study describes the morphology, texture and microfossil content of Hurricane Irene washover deposits at three contrasting barrier island sites: Cape Lookout, North Carolina, Assateague Island, Virginia and Fire Island, New York. At all three sites, run-up overwash occurred, wherein waves were sufficient to overtop parts of the beach system and transport sediment inland. However, at Fire Island, overwash was restricted by a higher elevational threshold to low spots in the beach system coinciding with pre-existing breaches in foredunes. The result was the formation of isolated, thinner, low-volume washover fans. At Assateague Island and Cape Lookout, lower elevational thresholds allowed waves to overtop longer continuous sections of beach systems, resulting in the formation of laterally-continuous, thicker, larger-volume washover terraces. Overall, the deposits lacked consistent trends in thickness and texture (such as thinning and fining inland, reflecting a progressive reduction in overwash competence). Thickness and texture of the deposits were both spatially variable and probably reflect infilling of low points on the former surface and the influence of beach and foredune sediment sources. All the washover deposits were essentially barren of foraminiferal microfossils, supporting the textural evidence that the adjacent beach and foredunes were the predominant sediment sources. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Aggradation; Foraminifera; Overwash; Storm surge; Washover fan; Washover terrace","Avila, L.A., Cangialosi, J., Tropical cyclone report, Hurricane Irene, 21-28 August, 2011 (2011) National Hurricane Center Report, p. 45. , http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL092011_Irene.pdf, Available online at; Blott, S.J., Pye, K., Technical communication Gradistat: a grain size distribution and statistics package for the analysis of unconsolidated sediments (2001) Earth Surf.

The field data are from hurricane Camille. The abnormal waves are readily identified from the wavelet spectrum as an area of high energy, well localized in time and frequency. The wavelet spectrum of abnormal waves, appearing in a group of high waves has maximum value at the time of abnormal wave occurrence and it is concentrated in a narrow frequency range. In contrast the single abnormal wave has wavelet spectrum covering a wide frequency range. The vertical asymmetry of single abnormal wave is reflected in asymmetrical distribution of wavelet transforms. The presence of components with similar phases as a factor for abnormal wave occurrence is studied. Before and after wave crest of asymmetrical abnormal wave, the phases are more dispersive than that during the abnormal crest occurrence. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

With advances in computing power, the volume of meteorological data generated by geoscience and climate researchers has been steadily increasing. The emerging technique of virtual globes has been regarded as an ideal platform for visualizing larger geospatial data over the Internet. To visualize and analyze meteorological data with the new virtual globes, this paper proposes a systematic meteorological data visualization (MDV) framework in World Wind, an open-source virtual globe. The key technologies, including a hierarchical octree-based multiresolution data organization, data scheduling, level of detail (LOD) and rendering are described in detail. The framework is then applied to a practical tropical cyclone simulation, including flow vectors, particle tracking, cross-sectional analysis, streamlines, pathway animation, and volume rendering. The results show that virtual globes are effective tools for meteorological data visualization and analysis. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Meteorological data; Tropical cyclones; Virtual globes; Visualization; Volume rendering","Ahrens, J., Large-scale data visualization using parallel data streaming (2001) IEEE Comput.

In this paper, a typhoon rainfall forecasting model is proposed to yield 1- to 6-h ahead forecasts of hourly rainfall. First, an input optimization step integrating multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) with support vector machine (SVM) is developed to identify the optimal input combinations. Second, based on the results of the first step, the forecasted rainfall from each station is used to obtain the spatial characteristics of the rainfall process is presented. An actual application to Tsengwen river basin is conducted to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model. The results clearly indicate that the proposed model effectively improves the forecasting performance and decreases the negative impact of increasing forecast lead time. The optimal input combinations can be obtained from the proposed model for different stations with different geographical conditions. In addition, the proposed model is capable of producing more acceptable the results of rainfall maps than other model.

Since MPAs may be situated in close proximity to urbanized areas and influenced by anthropogenic activities (e.g. continuous discharges of contaminated waters), the marine organisms contained in such waters are probably at risk. This study aimed at developing an integrated environmental risk assessment and management (IERAM) framework for enhancing the sustainability of such MPAs. The IERAM framework integrates conventional environmental risk assessment methods with a multi-layer-DPSIR (Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) conceptual approach, which can simplify the complex issues embraced by environmental management strategies and provide logical and concise management information. The IERAM process can generate a useful database, offer timely update on the status of MPAs, and assist in the prioritization of management options. We use the Cape d'Aguilar Marine Reserve in Hong Kong as an example to illustrate the IERAM framework. A comprehensive set of indicators were selected, aggregated and analyzed using this framework. Effects of management practices and programs were also assessed by comparing the temporal distributions of these indicators over a certain timeframe. Based on the obtained results, we have identified the most significant components for safeguarding the integrity of the marine reserve, and indicated the existing information gaps concerned with the management of the reserve.

Past valuations of this benefit have relied on the second-best replacement cost method, estimating the protective value of ECEs with the cost of building human-made storm barriers. A promising alternative methodological approach to incorporate these factors is using the expected damage function (EDF) method, which requires modeling the production of this protection service of ECEs and estimating its value in terms of reducing the expected damages or deaths avoided by coastal communities. This paper illustrates the EDF approach to value the storm protection service of ECEs, using the example of mangroves in Thailand to compare and contrast the EDF with the replacement cost approach to estimate the protective value of ECEs. In addition, the example of marshes in the US Gulf Coast is employed to show how the EDF approach can be combined with hydrodynamic analysis of simulated hurricane storm surges to determine the economic value of expected property damages reduced through the presence of marsh wetlands and their vegetation along a storm surge path. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Economic valuation; Estuarine and coastal ecosystems; Mangroves; Marsh; Storm protection service; Wave attenuation","Arkema, K.K., Guannel, G., Verutes, G., Wood, S.A., Guerry, A., Ruckelshaus, M., Kareiva, P., Silver, J.M., Coastal habitats shield people and proprery from sea-level rise and storms (2013) Nat.

The loss and disruption associated with Hurricane Katrina highlighted the vulnerabilities and special needs of young children exposed to natural disaster.Objective: The current study explored ways in which multiple stressors associated with Hurricane Katrina contributed to adverse outcomes. We hypothesize overall decreases in trauma symptoms over time. We further hypothesize that increased attachment and hurricane related risk factors will negatively influence longitudinal symptom patterns.Methods: Data was collected from families of preschool-aged children (ages 3–5) during the school year following Hurricane Katrina (2005–2006) and each subsequent school year (2006–2007, 2007–2008, and 2008–2009). Latent growth curve modeling was used to assess trauma symptoms overtime and the effect of risk indices on these trauma symptoms.Results: Results suggest an overall decrease in trauma distress symptoms over time and further indicate that attachment and trauma related risks of caregiver disruption, other non-human losses, trauma prior to and subsequent to the storm, as well as Katrina exposure are significant predictors of symptoms over time.Conclusions: Given the rapid physical, cognitive, and emotional development that occurs in early childhood, these findings support the importance of providing intervention with preschool age children post-disaster. Further, the findings also suggest that a relationship based treatment including both caregiver and child is most likely to be effective. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Attachment; Longitudinal; Natural disaster; Pre-school; Trauma symptoms; Young children",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921956433

The DwH disaster provided a challenge to the application of available ocean-forecast capabilities, and also generated a historically large observational dataset. AMSEAS was evaluated by four complementary efforts, each with somewhat different aims and approaches: a university research consortium within an Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) testbed; a petroleum industry consortium, the Gulf of Mexico 3-D Operational Ocean Forecast System Pilot Prediction Project (GOMEX-PPP); a British Petroleum (BP) funded project at the Northern Gulf Institute in response to the oil spill; and the Navy itself. Validation metrics are presented in these different projects for water temperature and salinity profiles, sea surface wind, sea surface temperature, sea surface height, and volume transport, for different forecast time scales. The validation found certain geographic and time biases/errors, and small but systematic improvements relative to earlier regional and global modeling efforts. On the basis of these positive AMSEAS validation studies, an oil spill transport simulation was conducted using archived AMSEAS nowcasts to examine transport into the estuaries east of the Mississippi River. This effort captured the influences of Hurricane Alex and a non-tropical cyclone off the Louisiana coast, both of which pushed oil into the western Mississippi Sound, illustrating the importance of the atmospheric influence on oil spills such as DwH. © 2014 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Deepwater Horizon; Gulf of Mexico; ocean forecasting; skill assessment",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921966724

The objective is to develop an efficient framework for system operators to minimize potential damages to power system components in a cost-effective manner. The problem is modeled as a stochastic integer program with complete recourse.

This study quantified the associations between infectious diarrhea and the seven tropical cyclones that landed in Zhejiang from 2005-2011 to assess the impacts of the accompanying precipitation on the studied diseases. Method: A unidirectional case-crossover study design was used to evaluate the impacts of tropical storms and typhoons on infectious diarrhea. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to eliminate multicollinearity. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: For all typhoons studied, the greatest impacts on bacillary dysentery and other infectious diarrhea were identified on lag 6 days (OR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.81-2.93) and lag 5 days (OR = 3.56, 95% CI: 2.98-4.25), respectively. For all tropical storms, impacts on these diseases were highest on lag 2 days (OR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.41-4.33) and lag 6 days (OR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.69-3.56), respectively. The tropical cyclone precipitation was a risk factor for both bacillary dysentery and other infectious diarrhea when daily precipitation reached 25 mm and 50 mm with the largest OR = 3.25 (95% CI: 1.45-7.27) and OR = 3.05 (95% CI: 2.20-4.23), respectively. Conclusions: Both typhoons and tropical storms could contribute to an increase in risk of bacillary dysentery and other infectious diarrhea in Zhejiang. Tropical cyclone precipitation may also be a risk factor for these diseases when it reaches or is above 25 mm and 50 mm, respectively. Public health preventive and intervention measures should consider the adverse health impacts from tropical cyclones. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Bacillary dysentery; Infectious diarrhea; Precipitation; Risk factor; Tropical cyclone","Shultz, J.M., Russell, J., Espinel, Z., Epidemiology of tropical cyclones: The dynamics of disaster, disease, and development (2005) Epidemiol.

A typhoon is very specific natural phenomenon which has a great impact on human life, including civil structures themselves. Combined with IT, operation of these monitoring systems enables reasonable, scientific, and economic maintenance based on measured data. IN particular, as climate has changed due to global warming, unexpected natural disasters have occurred more frequently. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) for the cable supported bridges in a typhoon can reduce maintenance efforts and costs. Scientific verification for cable supported bridge structural performance is also possible using SHM data. This can ensure a more efficient maintenance strategy is developed for bridges. This study analyzed the SHM data of a cable stayed bridge during a typhoon, with the structural capacity evaluated respective to the safety ratio for Fracture Critical Member (FCM). Finally, some strategies for cable supported bridge maintenance during a typhoon were suggested and its applicability was discussed. © 2014 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","cable stayed bridge; maintenance strategy; safety ratio; Structural Health Monitoring (SHM); typhoon",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922340694

Major tropical cyclones can infrequently move into the midaltitudes and inland areas. Ecologically, tropical cyclones have profound impacts on diversity, structure, succession and function of forest ecosystems. The ecological effects are both dramatic and subtle. The dramatic effects can be visible, noticeable and to some extent predictable over the short-term and relatively well documented in the literature. However, the subtle effects are often invisible, complex and at smaller scale relatively unpredictable in the long-term. Many factors, meteorologic, topographic and biologic, simultaneously interact to influence the complexity of patterns of damage and dynamics of recovery. I present a global synthesis on the effects of tropical cyclones on forest ecosystems and the complexity of forest responses, with particular attention on the response to large hurricanes in the neotropics and the temperate North America, and strong typhoons on the subtropical and temperate forests in the East and Southeast Asia. Four major aspects provide on organizational framework for this synthesis: (1) consistent damage patterns, (2) factors that influence response patterns and predict damage risks, (3) complexity of forest responses and recovery, and (4) the long-term effects. This review reveals highly variable and complex effects of tropical cyclones on forest ecosystems. A deep understanding of the synergistic effects of tropical cyclones is essential for effective forest management and biodiversity conservation. © 2015 Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Complexity; Hurricanes; Large infrequent disturbance; Multiple-scale; Synergistic effects; Tree mortality; Tropical cyclones; Typhoons",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921468810

Limited research has examined HPA axis dysregulation in youth exposed to disasters.Objective: This study examined HPA axis activation in adolescent Hurricane Katrina survivors relative to a non-exposed community comparison group. It was hypothesized that Hurricane Katrina survivors would experience lower basal morning cortisol and greater cortisol suppression with low-dose dexamethasone than the comparison group.Methods: Fourteen Hurricane Katrina survivors and nine non-exposed community residents were assessed 21 months after the disaster in this observational pilot study with an experimental component. Salivary cortisol was collected at baseline and following low-dose dexamethasone challenge. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive, and externalizing symptoms were assessed with self-report instruments.Results: Relative to the community participants, Hurricane Katrina survivors had significantly higher PTSD and depressive symptoms, and, as hypothesized, lower basal morning salivary cortisol. In the full sample, basal morning cortisol was negatively associated with depressive and externalizing symptoms. The hypothesis that low-dose dexamethasone challenge would show more cortisol suppression in Hurricane Katrina survivors than the comparison group was not supported, perhaps reflecting more depressive symptoms in the survivors or due to a floor effect of low cortisol levels.Conclusions: The results augment the extant literature on youth exposed to disasters by emphasizing the importance of depressive and externalizing symptoms as well as PTSD symptoms in HPA axis functioning. Future research is needed to fully elucidate HPA axis functioning in youth exposed to disasters. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Cortisol; Disaster; Hurricane Katrina; Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis; Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); Trauma",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921515320

In this panoramic work of social history, Stuart Schwartz examines how Caribbean societies have responded to the dangers of hurricanes, and how these destructive storms have influenced the region's history, from the rise of plantations, to slavery and its abolition, to migrations, racial conflict, and war. Taking readers from the voyages of Columbus to the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, Schwartz looks at the ethical, political, and economic challenges that hurricanes posed to the Caribbean's indigenous populations and the different European peoples who ventured to the New World to exploit its riches. He describes how the United States provided the model for responding to environmental threats when it emerged as a major power and began to exert its influence over the Caribbean in the nineteenth century, and how the region's governments came to assume greater responsibilities for prevention and relief, efforts that by the end of the twentieth century were being questioned by free-market neoliberals. Schwartz sheds light on catastrophes like Katrina by framing them within a long and contentious history of human interaction with the natural world. Spanning more than five centuries and drawing on extensive archival research in Europe and the Americas, Sea of Storms emphasizes the continuing role of race, social inequality, and economic ideology in the shaping of our responses to natural disaster. © 2015 by Princeton University Press.

Coastal inundation, caused by hurricanes and tropical storms, poses large risks for today's societies. High-fidelity numerical models of water levels driven by hurricane-force winds are required to predict these events, posing a challenging computational problem, and even though computational models continue to improve, uncertainties in storm surge forecasts are inevitable. Today, this uncertainty is often exposed to the user by running the simulation many times with different parameters or inputs following a Monte-Carlo framework in which uncertainties are represented as stochastic quantities. This results in multidimensional, multivariate and multivalued data, so-called ensemble data. While the resulting datasets are very comprehensive, they are also huge in size and thus hard to visualize and interpret. In this paper, we tackle this problem by means of an interactive and integrated visual analysis system. By harnessing the power of modern graphics processing units for visualization as well as computation, our system allows the user to browse through the simulation ensembles in real time, view specific parameter settings or simulation models and move between different spatial and temporal regions without delay. In addition, our system provides advanced visualizations to highlight the uncertainty or show the complete distribution of the simulations at user-defined positions over the complete time series of the prediction. We highlight the benefits of our system by presenting its application in a real-world scenario using a simulation of Hurricane Ike. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Ensemble data; Interactive Visualization; Storm surge; Visual analysis",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921326511

Response activities were assessed using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Public Health Emergency Preparedness Capabilities framework. Challenges that are typical of this response environment are reported.RESULTS:: Respondents described public health system responses to 45 events involving tornadoes, flooding, wildfires, winter weather, hurricanes, and other storms. Events of similar scale were infrequent for a majority (62%) of the communities involved; disruption to critical infrastructure was universal. Public Health Emergency Preparedness Capabilities considered most essential involved environmental health investigations, mass care and sheltering, surveillance and epidemiology, information sharing, and public information and warning. Unanticipated response activities or operational constraints were common.CONCLUSIONS:: We characterize extreme weather events as a “quadruple threat” because (1) direct threats to population health are accompanied by damage to public health protective and community infrastructure, (2) event characteristics often impose novel and pervasive burdens on communities, (3) responses rely on critical infrastructures whose failure both creates new burdens and diminishes response capacity, and (4) their infrequency and scale further compromise response capacity. Given the challenges associated with extreme weather events, we suggest opportunities for organizational learning and preparedness improvements. © 2015 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920767744

Firstly, this study utilized the USLE model and soil erosion pin data to compare the soil erosion potential of the Chushui and Aiyuzi subwatersheds and concluded that soil erosion drastically increased if accumulated rainfall exceeded 200 mm; also, erosion depths were greater in the Aiyuzi subwatershed while estimated total erosion volume was higher in the Chushui subwatershed; this was attributed to the larger area of Chushui subwatershed and based on field measurements which supported the results of the USLE model. Secondly, this study utilized modified USLE model to compare the extreme event erosion resulting from typhoon Morakot which revealed that high rainfall intensity and long-duration rainfall events can generate large volume non-point sources of sediment that is estimated to far exceed 7–10 times of the annual soil erosion. Thirdly, this study related the C parameter of the USLE model to the existing land use in the Shenmu watershed using current, real data. Finally, this study established a post-typhoon Morakot soil erosion risk map composed of five categories of risk which was compared with post-event land cover to suggest high-erosion risk zones that may require further monitoring, remediation, and engineering measures to limit soil loss. © 2015 The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering and Springer Japan","MUSLE; SER map; Shenmu watershed; Soil erosion; USLE",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920771024

Compelling features include the local availability and affordability of suitable soils, thermal insulation and humidity control properties, and small embodied energy compared with fired clay masonry. The mechanical properties of CSEBs have been the subject of several investigations. However, the research on the response and design optimization of CSEB masonry building structures is in its infancy, and a significant knowledge and technological gap exists with regard to resistance to extreme loads due to natural hazards (e.g., high winds and earthquakes). It is necessary to address this gap to understand whether engineered earth masonry can be enlisted to respond to the growing demand for hazard-resistant dwellings that are also affordable and sustainable.This paper discusses the feasibility of using earth masonry in low-rise dwelling structures to withstand extreme winds. Hurricanes and tornadoes periodically scourge vast areas in Central and North America and the Caribbean where low-income families live, and where the demand for sustainable construction meets that for structural resistance and affordability. Feasibility is studied based on the structural analysis of the main wind force resisting system (MWFRS) of a typical one-story single-family dwelling subject to wind pressures resulting from 3-s gust speeds up to 90. m/s (324. km/h). The output consists of parametric curves that relate wind speed with masonry compressive, tensile and shear strength demand for wall thicknesses ranging from 203 to 508. mm. The structural adequacy of the MWFRS is assessed for the cases of flat and 15° gable roof. The design implications are discussed vis-à-vis strength reduction factors and design strength demands, and sustainable reinforcement options. It is concluded that it is feasible to design one-story CSEB masonry dwellings that can withstand winds loads from Category 4 hurricanes and EF3 tornadoes, provided that a rigid horizontal diaphragm is used. Grouted steel reinforcement may be used in safety shelter CSEB masonry structures to be designed for more extreme wind loads. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Green building; Hurricane; Masonry structures; Soil stabilization; Sustainability; Tornado; Wind load","Houben, H., Guillaud, H., (1994) Earth construction: a comprehensive guide, , Practical Action Publishing, Bourton on Dunsmore, UK; Morton, T., Stevenson, F., Taylor, B., Smith, N.C., (2005) Low cost earth brick construction - 2 Kirk Park, Dalguise: monitoring and evaluation, , Auchtermuchty, UK: Arc; Minke, G., (2006) Building with earth - design and technology of a sustainable architecture, , Birkhäuser, Basel, Switzerland; Morton, T., (2008) Earth masonry - design and construction guidelines, , HIS BRE Press, Watford, UK; Allinson, D., Hall, M., Humidity buffering using stabilised rammed earth materials (2012) Construction materials, proc Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE), 165 (6), pp. 335-344; Torgal, F.P., Jalali, S., (2011) Eco-efficient construction and building materials, , Springer, London, UK; Klingner, R.E., Behavior of masonry in the Northridge (US) and Tecomán-Colima (Mexico) earthquakes: lessons learned, and changes in US design provisions (2005) Constr Build Mater, 20 (4), pp. 209-219; Taucer, F., Alarcon, J.E., So, E., 2007 August 15 magnitude 7.9 earthquake near the coast of central Peru: analysis and field mission report (2009) Bull Earthq Eng, 7 (1), pp. 1-70; Gomes, M.I., Lopes, M., de Brito, J., Seismic resistance of earth construction in Portugal (2011) Eng Struct, 33 (3), pp. 932-941; Morris, H.W., Walker, R., Drupsteen, T., Modern and historic earth buildings: observations of the 4th September Darfield earthquake (2011) Proc 9th Pacific conference on earthquake engineering: building an earthquake-resilient society (PCEE 2011), p. 10. , Auckland, New Zealand: New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering [Paper No. 133]; Angulo-Ibáñez, Q., Mas-Tomás, T., Galvañ-Llopis, V., Sántolaria-Montesinos, J.L., Traditional braces of earth constructions (2012) Constr Build Mater, 30, pp. 389-399; Walker, P.J., Strength and erosion characteristics of earth blocks and earth block masonry (2004) J Mater Civil Eng, 16 (5), pp. 497-506; Bresnan, P., http://www.otisike.com/welcome/crow.html, [accessed 16.11.13]Vilane, B.R.T., Assessment of stabilisation of adobes by confined compression tests (2010) Biosyst Eng, 106 (4), pp. 551-558; Morel, J.C., Pkla, A., Walker, P., Compressive strength testing of compressed earth blocks (2007) Constr Build Mater, 21 (2), pp. 303-309; Perera, A., Jayasinghe, C., Strength characteristic and structural design methods for compressed earth block walls (2003) Masonry Int, 16 (1), pp. 34-38; Tennant, A.G., Foster, C.D., Venkatarama Reddy, B.V., Verification of masonry building code to flexural behavior of cement-stabilized soil block (2013) J Mater Civil Eng, 25 (3), pp. 303-307; Jayasinghe, C., Mallawaarachchi, R.S., Flexural strength of compressed stabilized earth masonry materials (2009) Mater Des, 30 (9), pp. 3859-3868; (1998) Materials and workmanship for earth buildings, , NZS 4298:1998.

These forests provide important ecosystem goods and services to the region's dense coastal populations and support important functions of the biosphere. Mangroves are under threat from both natural and anthropogenic stressors; however the current status and dynamics of the region's mangroves are poorly understood. We mapped the current extent of mangrove forests in South Asia and identified mangrove forest cover change (gain and loss) from 2000 to 2012 using Landsat satellite data. We also conducted three case studies in Indus Delta (Pakistan), Goa (India), and Sundarbans (Bangladesh and India) to identify rates, patterns, and causes of change in greater spatial and thematic details compared to regional assessment of mangrove forests.Our findings revealed that the areal extent of mangrove forests in South Asia is approximately 1,187,476ha representing ~7% of the global total. Our results showed that from 2000 to 2012, 92,135ha of mangroves were deforested and 80,461ha were reforested with a net loss of 11,673ha. In all three case studies, mangrove areas have remained the same or increased slightly, however, the turnover was greater than the net change. Both, natural and anthropogenic factors are responsible for the change and turnover. The major causes of forest cover change are similar throughout the region; however, specific factors may be dominant in specific areas. Major causes of deforestation in South Asia include (i) conversion to other land use (e.g. conversion to agriculture, shrimp farms, development, and human settlement), (ii) over-harvesting (e.g. grazing, browsing and lopping, and fishing), (iii) pollution, (iv) decline in freshwater availability, (v) floodings, (vi) reduction of silt deposition, (vii) coastal erosion, and (viii) disturbances from tropical cyclones and tsunamis. Our analysis in the region's diverse socio-economic and environmental conditions highlights complex patterns of mangrove distribution and change. Results from this study provide important insight to the conservation and management of the important and threatened South Asian mangrove ecosystem. © 2014 .","Image processing; Landsat; Mangrove forest cover change; Mangrove forests; Remote sensing; South Asia","Amjad, A.S., Jusoff, K., Mangrove conservation through community participation in Pakistan: the case of Sonmiani Bay (2007) The 5th WSEAS International Conference on Environment, Ecosystems and Development (EED'07), Puerto De La Cruz, Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain; Archer, S., Schimel, D.S., Holland, E.A., Mechanisms of shrubland expansion: land use, climate or CO2?

Cores and surface samples were collected along a transect southwest from Southwest Pass (∼30-m water depth) to the head of the Mississippi Canyon (∼170-m depth) in 2004, 2005, and 2007 following hurricane, non-hurricane, and Mississippi flood episodes. Discriminant analysis indicates that all unit types are generally distinguishable. Species that contribute most to the discrimination of units are mostly rare, while the species significant in the ANOVA are among the most abundant. Both abundant and rare species were useful for identifying the provenance of hurricane-deposited sediment. Seaward transport of sediment by hurricanes is indicated by the presence of rare marsh taxa (not recorded in non-hurricane units) and increased relative abundance of coastal taxa in the hurricane units. High relative abundances of taxa that are abundant in both the hurricane and non-hurricane units suggest a portion of the hurricane-deposited sediments were also locally derived. In summary, foraminifera can provide information on the provenance of hurricane-deposited sediment soon after deposition, but bioturbation can destroy this signal rapidly.",,"Allison, M.A., Sheremet, A., Goni, M.A., Stone, G.W., Storm layer deposition on the Mississippi-Atchafalaya subaqueous delta generated by Hurricane Lili in 2002 (2005) Continental Shelf Research, 25, pp. 2213-2232; Andersen, H.V., Two new species of Haplophragmoides from the Louisiana coast (1953) Contributions from the Cushman Foundation for Foraminiferal Research, 4, pp. 20-22; Andersen, H.V., Genesis and paleontology of the Mississippi River mudlumps, pt.

Increasing VGR from 21 to 43 levels produces stronger hurricanes, whereas increasing it further to 64 levels does not intensify the storms further, but intensity fluctuations are much reduced. Moreover, increasing the lower-level VGRs generates stronger storms, but the opposite is true for increased upper-level VGRs. On average, adding mean flow increases intensity fluctuations and variability (between the strongest and weakest hurricanes), whereas adding vertical wind shear (VWS) delays hurricane intensification and then causes more rapid growth in intensity variability. The stronger the VWS, the larger intensity variability and bifurcation rate occur at later stages. These intensity differences are found to be closely related to inner-core structural changes, and they are attributable to how much latent heat could be released in higher-VGR layers, followed by how much moisture content in nearby layers is converged. Hurricane intensity with higherVGRs is shown to bemuch less sensitive to varying background flows, and stronger hurricane vortices at the model initial time are less sensitive to the vertical distribution of VGR; the opposite is true for relatively uniform VGRs or weaker hurricane vortices. Results reveal that higher VGRs with a near-parabolic or V shape tend to produce smoother intensity variations and more typical inner-core structures. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.",,"Anthes, R.A., Keyser, D., Tests of a fine-mesh model over Europe and United States (1979) Mon.

Though Hurricane Ike in 2008 was relatively less severe, it still caused significant damage in the Gulf Coast Region, especially in Houston, Texas, the fourth largest city and the sixth largest metropolitan area in the United States. This study obtains the storm parameters of Hurricane Ike from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and then employs a hurricane model to estimate the strength of wind and the property damages by census tract. To fill the gaps in disaster loss estimation models, this paper adopted a systematic method that combines disaster models, a regional input/output model, and a spatial allocation model to estimate the spatial distribution of property damage and business interruption losses of Hurricane Ike in the Greater Houston region. The modeling results of property damage are reasonably close to the estimates from insured damage claims after Hurricane Ike. The spatial distribution of economic losses in industrial sectors generated by the model is needed for policymakers and planners to identify the most cost-effective options for disaster mitigation and allocate manpower and resources for disaster relief efficiently and equitably. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Baade, R.A., Baumann, R., Matheson, V., Estimating the economic impact of natural and social disasters, with an application to hurricane Katrina (2007) Urban Stud., 44 (11), pp. 2061-2076; Berg, R., (2009) Hurricane IKE: Tropical Cyclone Rep., , National Hurricane Center (NHC), Miami, FL; Boarnet, G.M., Business losses, transportation damage, and the Northridge earthquake (1998) J.

The ""rainpower,"" or energy per unit time that is lost to friction as rain falls through a hurricane, has not been quantified, and its effect on hurricane intensity remains unknown. Here we use satellite data to show that the rainpower is on the same order of magnitude as the ocean-derived power that fuels the hurricane. By coupling the satellite data to a suitably modified version of the Carnot-heat-engine model of hurricanes, we estimate that rainpower lessens hurricane intensity by 20% on average, bringing the predicted intensities of North Atlantic hurricanes into a much improved accord with a 30 year record of observations.

In light of this unusual and catastrophic event, the Greenland blocking conditions associated with Sandy and previous North Atlantic hurricane tracks are examined from a climatological perspective. Two primary questions raised by Sandy are investigated: (1) How anomalous were the Greenland blocking conditions observed prior to Sandy's landfall? (2) Were North Atlantic hurricane tracks in the historical record affected by Greenland blocking conditions in a manner similar to Sandy? The measure of blocking strength used to answer these questions is the Greenland Blocking Index (GBI), which is calculated as the spatial average of 500hPa heights over the Greenland region. The GBI prior to Sandy's landfall was found to be more typical of late June conditions, exceeding the 90th percentile of late October climatology during the entire preceding week and peaking at near-record values (99.8th percentile) on 25 October. Analysis of the GBI in relation to past North Atlantic hurricane tracks shows that above-normal GBI values were associated with a southward displacement of hurricane tracks and an increased concentration of tracks near the Northeast US coast. Additionally, composites of atmospheric conditions for 'anomalous' hurricane tracks (defined as tracks with an initial bearing angle between 90° and 360°) revealed an atypical area of high pressure centred over the Canadian Maritimes during these events, whereas near-climatological conditions of atmospheric pressure over the North Atlantic prevailed for 'normal' hurricane tracks. However, variations in Greenland blocking conditions were not associated with significant changes in the frequency of anomalous North Atlantic hurricane tracks. © 2014 Royal Meteorological Society.","Arctic amplification; Atmospheric blocking; Greenland; Hurricanes; Sandy","Abdi, H., Williams, L.J., Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test (2010) Encyclopedia of Research Design, pp. 1-5. , Salkind N (ed).

Highway incident data from New York City and its surrounding regions before and after Hurricane Sandy was used for the study. Moran's I statistics confirmed that durations of the neighboring incidents were spatially correlated. Moreover, Lagrange Multiplier tests suggested that the spatial dependence should be captured in a spatial lag specification. A spatial error model, a spatial lag model and a standard model without consideration of spatial effects were developed. The spatial lag model is found to outperform the others by capturing the spatial dependence of incident durations via a spatially lagged dependent variable. It was further used to assess the effects of hurricane-related variables on incident duration. The results show that the incidents during and post the hurricane are expected to have 116.3% and 79.8% longer durations than those that occurred in the regular time. However, no significant increase in incident duration is observed in the evacuation period before Sandy's landfall. Results of temporal stability tests further confirm the existence of the significant changes in incident duration patterns during and post the hurricane. Those findings can provide insights to aid in the development of hurricane evacuation plans and emergency management strategies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Hurricane Sandy; Incident duration; Spatial dependence; Spatial lag model","Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE Trans.

However, SLP generally cannot be measured in open oceans due to limited buoys. Because of the potential availability of an O2-band differential absorption radar for sea surface barometry, we investigate the value of assimilating various patterns of SLP from such a system on hurricane prediction using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) three-dimensional variational data assimilation system (3DVAR) based on Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs). An important objective of this series of study is to explore the potential to use space and airborne sea surface air pressure measurements from an O2-band differential absorption radar currently under development for server weather including hurricane forecasts. The surface pressure patterns include an area of SLP, and a band of SLP either through the center or tangent to the hurricane position; the latter two distributions are similar to what could be obtained from the differential absorption radar system, which could be installed on spaceborne satellites and/or mounted on reconnaissance aircraft. In the banded pressure cases, we propose a vortex reconstruction technique based on surface pressure field. Assimilating observations from the reconstructed surface pressure leads to a better representation of initial SLP and vertical cross-section of wind, relative to the control where no data is assimilated and to the assimilation without vortex reconstruction. In eight of the nine OSSEs simulations on three hurricanes with three leading times of integration, which cover a wide range of initial minimum SLP from 951 to 1011. hPa, substantial improvements are found not only in the hurricane track and position, but also in the hurricane intensity, in terms of the SLP and maximum surface wind. The only case without significant improvement is resulted from the very weak initial condition (SLP 1011. hPa), which had no clear indication of tropical disturbance at the stage for initialization. The improvements of assimilation are generally enhanced for the stronger hurricanes whose differences in initial minimum SLP between nature run and control are larger. © 2014.","Hurricane; O2-band differential absorption radar; Observing system simulation experiments; Sea level pressure; Three-dimensional variational data assimilation system; Weather and research forecast","Holton, J.R., (1979) An introduction to dynamic meteorology, p. 416. , Academic Press, New York; Barton, J., Scott, J.C., Remote measurement of surface pressure using absorption in the oxygen A-band (1986) Appl Opt, 25 (19), pp. 3502-3507; Korb, C.L., Weng, C.Y., A theoretical study of a two-wavelength lidar technique for the measurement of atmospheric temperature profiles (1982) J Appl Meteorol, 21 (9), pp. 1346-1355; Singer, S.F., Measurement of atmospheric surface pressure with a satellite-borne laser (1968) Appl Opt, 7 (6), pp. 1125-1127; Wu, M.L., Remote sensing of cloud-top pressure using reflected solar radiation in the oxygen A-band (1985) J Clim Appl Meteorol, 24, pp. 539-546; Flower, D.A., Peckham, G.E., A microwave pressure sounder (1978), p. 30561. , NASA STI/Recon TechnicalLin, B., Hu, Y., Numerical simulations of radar surface air pressure measurements at O2 bands (2005) Geosci Remote Sens, 2, pp. 324-328; Lawrence, R., Lin, B., Harrah, S., Hu, Y., Hunt, P., Lipp, C., Initial flight test results of differential absorption barometric radar for remote sensing of sea surface air pressure (2011) J Quant Spectrosc Radiat Transf, 112, pp. 247-253; Lawrence, R., Lin, B., Harrah, S., Min, Q., Differential absorption microwave radar measurements for remote sensing of barometric pressure (2012) Remote Sensing - Advanced Techniques and Platforms, , http://www.intechopen.com/books/remote-sensing-advanced-techniques-and-platforms/differential-absorptionmicrowave-radar-measurements-for-remote-sensing-of-barometric-pressure, InTech, 〈〉, B.

Washover fan stratigraphy preserves a topset-foreset break (TFB) that rises 0.42 m in elevation as the fan built landward. We constrain overwash flow depths to 0.1-0.32 m through deposit sedimentology, and tie the rising trajectory of the TFB to rising storm surge water levels measured in the back-barrier bay (0.03 m h-1) as the hurricane approached the coast. This relation allows us to estimate that the fan took 0.52-0.90 days to build, and was finished building before the storm surge peaked. This is 15-25% of the 3.5 days of hurricane- induced storm surge near the site. We show how washover stratigraphy can be used to constrain the timing and amount of sediment redistribution on a coast associated with a hurricane; information that is necessary to test and/or calibrate existing numerical models that predict shoreline change during hurricanes. © 2014 Geological Society of America.",,"Ashida, K., Bayazit, M., Initiation of motion and roughness of flows in steep channels (1973) Proceedings, 15th Congress of the International Association for Hydraulic Research, pp. 475-484;

Without such perturbations, this current represents a potential barrier to the transport of planktonic lionfish eggs and larvae across the Straits of Florida. We further show that once lionfish became established in the Bahamas, hurricanes significantly hastened their spread through the island chain. We gain these insights through: (1) an analysis of the direction and velocity of simulated ocean currents during the passage of hurricanes through the Florida Straits and (2) the development of a biophysical model that incorporates the tolerances of lionfish to ocean climate, their reproductive strategy, and duration that the larvae remain viable in the water column. On the basis of this work, we identify 23 occasions between the years 1992 and 2006 in which lionfish were provided the opportunity to breach the Florida Current. We also find that hurricanes during this period increased the rate of spread of lionfish through the Bahamas by more than 45% and magnified its population by at least 15%. Beyond invasive lionfish, we suggest that extreme weather events such as hurricanes likely help to homogenize the gene pool for all Caribbean marine species susceptible to transport. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Computer simulation; Hurricanes; Invasive species; Lionfish; Reef connectivity","Ahrenholz, D.W., Morris, J.A., Larval duration of the lionfish, Pterois volitans along the Bahamian Archipelago (2010) Environmental Biology of Fishes, 88, pp. 305-309; Albins, M.A., Hixon, M.A., Invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish Pterois volitans reduce recruitment of Atlantic coral-reef fishes (2008) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 367, pp. 233-238; Albins, M.A., Hixon, M.A., Worst case scenario: potential long-term effects of invasive predatory lionfish (Pterois volitans) on Atlantic and Caribbean coral-reef communities (2011) Environmental Biology of Fishes, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9795-1; Amante, C., Eakins, B.W., ETOPO1 1 Arc-Minute Global Relief Model: Procedures, Data Sources and Analysis (2009), 24, p. 19. , NOAA Technical Memorandum NESDIS NGDC, March 2009Anthes, R.A., Corell, R.W., Holland, G., Hurrell, J.W., MacCracken, M.C., Hurricanes and global warming-potential linkages and consequences (2006) Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 87, pp. 623-628; Arias-González, J.E., González-Gándara, C., Luis Cabrera, J., Christensen, V., Predicted impact of the invasive lionfish Pterois volitans on the food web of a Caribbean coral reef (2011) Environmental Research, 111, pp. 917-925; Barbour, A.B., Montgomery, M.L., Adamson, A.A., Díaz-Ferguson, E., Silliman, B.R., Mangrove use by the invasive lionfish Pterois volitans (2008) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 401, pp. 291-294; Bellingham, P.J., Tanner, E.V., Healey, J.R., Hurricane disturbance accelerates invasion by the alien tree Pittosporum undulatum in Jamaican montane rain forests (2005) Journal of Vegetation Science, 16, pp. 675-684; Betancur-R, R., Hines, A., Acero, A.P., Orti, G., Wilbur, A.E., Freshwater, D.W., Reconstructing the lionfish invasion: insights into Greater Caribbean biogeography (2011) Journal of Biogeography, 38, pp. 1281-1293; Bonjean, F., Lagerloef, G.S.E., Diagnostic model and analysis of the surface currents in the tropical Pacific Ocean (2002) Journal of Physical Oceanography, 32, pp. 2938-2954; Carlin, J.L., Robertson, D.R., Bowen, B.W., Ancient divergences and recent connections in two tropical Atlantic reef fishes Epinephelus adscensionis and Rypticus saponaceous (Percoidei: Serranidae) (2003) Marine Biology, 143, pp. 1057-1069; Chassignet, E.P., Hurlburt, H.E., Smedstad, O.M., The HYCOM (hybrid coordinate ocean model) data assimilative system (2007) Journal of Marine Systems, 65, pp. 60-83; Côté, I.M., Green, S.J., Morris Jr, J.A., Akins, J.L., Steinke, D., Diet richness of invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish revealed by DNA barcoding (2013) Marine Ecology Progress Series, 472, pp. 249-256; Crooks, J.A., Lag times and exotic species: the ecology and management of biological invasions in slow-motion (2005) Ecoscience, 12, pp. 316-329; Crooks, J.A., Soulé, M.E., Lag times in population explosions of invasive species: causes and implications (1999) Invasive species and biodiversity management, pp. 103-125. , In, eds Sanderlund O, Schei P, Viken A) -.

It is shown that this hurricane-scale model contains MPI as an asymptotically stable spiral point under the wind-induced surface heat exchange (WISHE) feedback mechanism. Furthermore, the hurricane development is characterized by two different time-scales instead of a simple linear growth, as often assumed in previous studies. Inclusion of radiative cooling reduces the MPI limit, but the MPI equilibrium in general is structurally stable. In particular, radiative cooling will modify the basin of attraction of the MPI equilibrium and create a domain in the phase space of the hurricane scales such that a vortex would not develop if its initial condition falls within this domain. Potential mechanisms that can further unfold the stability of the MPI equilibrium will also be discussed. © 2015 Royal Meteorological Society.","Hurricane radiative equilibrium; MPI equilibrium; MPI stability; Tropical cyclones; WISHE feedback",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929427900

Using a 14-year monitored population of Alouatta palliata mexicana as a study system, we developed a modeling framework to assess the relative contribution of hurricane disturbance and two types of human impacts, habitat loss, and hunting, on quasi-extinction risk. We found that the scenario with the highest level of disturbance generated a 21% increase in quasi-extinction risk by 40 years compared to scenarios of intermediate disturbance, and around 67% increase relative to that found in low disturbance scenarios. We also found that the probability of reaching quasi-extinction due to human disturbance alone was below 1% by 40 years, although such scenarios reduced population size by 70%, whereas the risk of quasi-extinction ranged between 3% and 65% for different scenarios of hurricane severity alone, in absence of human impacts. Our analysis moreover found that the quasi-extinction risk driven by hunting and hurricane disturbance was significantly lower than the quasi-extinction risk posed by human-driven habitat loss and hurricane disturbance. These models suggest that hurricane disturbance has the potential to exceed the risk posed by human impacts, and, in particular, to substantially increase the speed of the extinction vortex driven by habitat loss relative to that driven by hunting. Early mitigation of habitat loss constituted the best method for reducing quasi-extinction risk: the earlier habitat loss is halted, the less vulnerable the population becomes to hurricane disturbance. By using a well-studied population of A. p. mexicana, we help understand the demographic impacts that extreme environmental disturbance can trigger on isolated populations of taxa already endangered in other systems where long-term demographic data are not available. For those experiencing heavy anthropogenic pressure and lacking sufficiently evolved coping strategies against unpredictable environmental disturbance, the risk of population extinction can be exacerbated. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Adaptability; Demographic change; Hurricane severity; Population viability analysis; Quasi-extinction",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926442208

This system performed well for three of the ten costliest Atlantic hurricanes: Ike (2008), Irene (2011), and Sandy (2012). Four to five days before these storms made landfall, the system produced good deterministic and probabilistic forecasts of not only track and intensity, but also of the spatial distributions of surface wind and rainfall. Averaged over all 102 applicable cases that have inner-core airborne Doppler radar observations during 2008-2012, the system reduced the day-2-to-day-4 intensity forecast errors by 25%-28% compared to the corresponding National Hurricane Center's official forecasts (which have seen little or no decrease in intensity forecast errors over the past two decades).

The landfall of a hurricane involves different hazard sources (i.e., wind, windborne debris, flood, and rain) that interact to generate the hazard scenario for a given structure. Thus, hurricanes can be viewed and must be analyzed as multi-hazard scenarios. In this study, a probabilistic Performance-Based Hurricane Engineering (PBHE) framework is used for the risk assessment of a residential structure subjected to hurricane hazard. A case study of a hypothetical residential house subjected to the combined hazards of wind, windborne debris, flood, and rainfall is considered to illustrate the sequential procedure for the probabilistic risk assessment.

One key purpose of this series of study is to explore the potential of using remotely sensed sea surface barometric data from O2-band differential absorption radar system currently under development for server weather including hurricane forecasts. In this part II we further validate the conclusions of observational system simulation experiments (OSSEs) in the part I using observed SLP for three hurricanes that passed over the Florida peninsula. Three SLP patterns are tested again, including all available data near the Florida peninsula, and a band of observations either through the center or tangent to the hurricane position. Before the assimilation, a vortex SLP reconstruction technique is employed for the use of observed SLP as discussed in the part I. In agreement with the results from OSSEs, the performance of assimilating SLP is enhanced for the two hurricanes with stronger initial minimum SLP, leading to a significant improvement in the track and position relative to the control where no data are assimilated. On the other hand, however, the improvement in the hurricane intensity is generally limited to the first 24-48h of integration, while a high resolution nested domain simulation, along with assimilation of SLP in the coarse domain, shows more profound improvement in the intensity. A diagnostic analysis of the potential vorticity suggests that the improved track forecasts are attributed to the combined effects of adjusting the steering wind fields in a consistent manner with having a deeper vortex, and the associated changes in the convective activity. © 2014.","Hurricane; Observational system simulation experiments; Potential vorticity; Sea-level pressure; Three dimensional variational data assimilation system; Weather and research forecast","Beven, J.L., Avila, L.A., Blake, E.S., Brown, D.P., Franklin, J.L., Knabb, R.D., Atlantic hurricane season of 2005 (2008) Mon Weather Rev, 136, pp. 1109-1173; Rappaport, E.N., Frankin, J.L., AvilaS, L.A., Baig, R., Beven, J.L., Blake, E.S., Advances and challenges at the National Hurricane Center (2009) Weather Forecast, 24, pp. 395-419; Holland, G.J., Tropical cyclone motion: environmental interaction plus a beta effect (1983) J Atmos Sci, 40, pp. 328-342; Molinari, J., Vollaro, D., External influences on hurricane intensity.

The relationship between this so-called hurricane CAPE and the surface pressure is exploited by a widely used algorithm for hurricane potential intensity (PI). For the observed atmosphere, the algorithm is shown to yield significantly weaker pressure intensity (20%-25%) and velocity intensity (5%-10%) than the most familiar analytical formulas. This discrepancy is found to come mostly from thermodynamic approximations in the formulas. The CAPE-PI algorithm makes a significant adjustment to the hurricane CAPE by subtracting the environmental CAPE. Most of the environmental profile becomes irrelevant as a result.Other steady-state theories retain the influence of the full environmental column. The impact of this choice on the pressure and velocity PI is analyzed. Another important choice-whether to allow the eyewall kinetic energy to contribute to the surface pressure perturbation-is also analyzed and quantified. The analytical formula for the velocity is updated with fullmoist thermodynamics and compared to the algorithm. The latter emerges as an excellent overall diagnostic of the underlying model. An exact algorithm for the velocity is also derived, based on its relationship to the radial derivative of hurricane CAPE. The thermodynamic efficiency often invoked to interpret velocity PI is identified as a marginal efficiency measured at the point of maximum energy dissipation rate and is contrasted with the global efficiency, which has a direct connection with the pressure intensity. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.","Algorithms; Atmosphere-ocean interaction; Boundary layer; Hurricanes; Sea surface temperature; Tropical cyclones","Bell, M.M., Montgomery, M.T., Observed structure, evolution, and potential intensity of category 5 Hurricane Isabel (2003) from 12 to 14 September (2008) Mon.

Dayton St., Madison, WI, United States","The relationship between minimum central surface pressure and the maximum sustained surface wind in tropical cyclones has been studied for many years, motivated by the fact that minimum pressure is generally easier to measure, but maximum wind is a much more relevant metric when considering tropical cyclone risk and potential impacts. It is well understood that tropical cyclone wind is closely related to the radial gradient of pressure through gradient or cyclostrophic balance assumptions, and not to a single point value of the minimum pressure near the storm center. But it is often the case that the maximum wind must be inferred from this single value. To accomplish this, a number of statistical relationships have been documented, such as those used in the Dvorak technique for estimating tropical cyclone intensity from satellite imagery. Here, the relationship between tropical cyclone maximum wind and minimum pressure is explored during eyewall replacement cycles (ERCs) that have been observed in North Atlantic hurricanes. It is shown that the wind- pressure relationship (WPR) can vary substantially during an ERC and generally moves away from the statistically fitted WPR used by the Dvorak technique in that basin. The changes in WPR during an ERC can be quite different depending on the intensity of the hurricane at the start of the ERC. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.","Hurricanes/typhoons; Operational forecasting","Brown, D.P., Franklin, J.L., Landsea, C., A fresh look at tropical cyclone pressure-wind relationships using recent reconnaissance-based ''best track'' data (1998-2005).

From 2004 to 2008, five major hurricanes-destroyed 181 structures and 1673 wells in the Gulf of Mexico. State and federal regulatory agencies were forced to deal with an unprecedented number of applications to Rigs-to-Reef Programs because operators wanted to permit their toppled structures as reefs. In 2009, the Minerals Management Service issued a moratorium on reef proposals outside of established planning areas in response to public criticism and NGO assertions that Rigs-to-Reef was becoming a de facto ""Ocean Dumping Program"". In 2013, the moratorium was lifted, and in a recently released Rigs-to-Reef Interim Policy Document 2013-07, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement specified that no departures from regulatory requirements will be granted for toppled structures. The purpose of this article is to describe the status of hurricane clean-up activity in the Gulf of Mexico, and to identify the challenges associated with unconventional decommissioning operations. Through 2013, 141 hurricane-destroyed structures and 1537 wells have been decommissioned. Remaining structures that await regulatory approval are likely to be more expensive and difficult to decommission relative to previous activity. Federal regulatory responses in the aftermath of the hurricane destruction are described. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Hurricane destruction; Toppled structures; Unconventional decommissioning","(2004) MMS updates damage assessment from Hurricane Ivan, , http://www.mms.gov/ooc/press%20/2004/%20press1008a.htm, Release: #3164.

Although different retrofit measures can be used to mitigate hurricane damage and reduce the associated social and economic losses, it is a challenge to choose the most cost effective one. In the case of residential buildings, the resources available for hurricane risk mitigation are limited and the upfront costs of improved design alternatives and retrofit measures are usually high. In this study, a probabilistic Performance-Based Hurricane Engineering (PBHE) framework is used to compare the effectiveness of different hurricane retrofit techniques for residential building from a cost-benefit point of view.

This paper, the first part of the study, evaluates the structures of spiral rainbands and compares them to previous observations. Four types of spiral rainbands are identified: principal, secondary, distant, and inner rainbands. Principal rainbands tend to be stationary relative to the storm center, while secondary rainbands are more transient and move around the storm center. Both principal and secondary rainbands are tilted radially outward with height and have many of the commonly observed kinematic features, such as overturning secondary circulation and enhanced tangential velocity on their radially outward sides. Principal rainbands are bounded by very dry air on their radially outward sides. Distant rainbands are radially inward-tilting convective features that have dense cold pools near the surface. Inner rainbands are made of shallow convection that appears to have originated from near the eyewall. Differences in the structures of spiral rainbands between observations and the Hurricane Bill simulation are noted. The second part of the study investigates how inner rainbands propagate and makes comparison with previously proposed hypotheses such as vortex Rossby waves. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.","Hurricanes; Hurricanes/typhoons; Tropical cyclones","Akter, N., Tsuboki, K., Numerical simulation of Cyclone Sidr using a cloud-resolving model: Characteristics and formation process of an outer rainband (2012) Mon.

This paper evaluates whether the propagation of inner rainbands in the Hurricane Bill simulation is consistent with previously proposed hypotheses. Results indicate that the propagation of inner rainbands is not consistent with gravity waves, vortex Rossby waves, or squall lines. An alternative hypothesis is offered, arguing that inner rainbands are simply convective clouds that are advected by the rapidly rotating tropical cyclone wind field while being deformed into spiral shapes.

We have analyzed Meteosat infrared cloud top temperature data to determine the areal coverage of cold cloud tops over a 6 year period from 2005 to 2010. In addition, hurricane statistics from the same period (intensity, date of generation, location, and maximum winds) were obtained from the National Hurricane Center database. We first show that the areal coverage of cold clouds (with brightness temperatures T<inf>b</inf> < -50C) in tropical Africa is a good indicator of the monthly number of African Easterly Waves (AEWs) leaving the west coast of tropical Africa. Furthermore, the AEWs that develop into tropical storms have a significantly larger area covered by cold cloud tops compared with nondeveloping waves. Finally, we show that on a storm-by-storm basis, the cold cloud coverage in West Africa is positively correlated (r = 0.57) with the accumulated cyclone energy of the future tropical cyclones that develop out of these waves. ©2015.

As such, undisturbed operations of the HSC are vital to ensuring the economic prosperity of local, state, and national interests. History has proved that coastal infrastructure systems and operations at the HSC are easily disrupted by severe rainfall and storm surge conditions induced by hurricanes (e.g., Hurricane Ike in 2008). A coupled riverine-coastal hydraulic model was developed to quantitatively evaluate flood and storm surge vulnerability for the HSC and Galveston Bay, Texas, as an initial testbed for simulating extreme flooding scenarios. A numerical investigation was made on the combined interactions of upland runoff and downstream surge occurrences. This includes an evaluation on the hydraulic effectiveness of a proposed surge gate at reducing surge inundation levels inland and near HSC infrastructure for a simulated Hurricane Ike event, and associated variations of Hurricane Ike surge characteristics. Sensitivities in peak stage, upland flows, and relative timing separations between rainfall hydrographs and storm surges were also explored. Results show that a proposed surge gate system can be an effective way to reduce surge inundation levels and the floodplain extent within the HSC area and upstream portions of the San Jacinto River. Under the various surge scenarios based on Hurricane Ike, water surface elevation and floodplain area reductions ranged from 34 to 45% and 7 to 20%, respectively, with event scenarios of greater storm surge volume providing greater storm surge reduction benefit. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Ataei, N., Stearns, M., Padgett, J., Response sensitivity and probabilistic damage assessment of coastal bridges under surge and wave loading (2010) Transp.

Eventually, TC simulations can be conducted at Large Eddy Simulation (LES) resolution, which requires Δx to fall in the inertial subrange (often &lt;102 m) to adequately resolve the large, energy-containing eddies. Between the two lies the so-called ""terra incognita"" because some of the assumptions used by mesoscale models and LES to treat BL turbulence are invalid. This study performs several 4-6 h simulations of Hurricane Katrina (2005) without a BL parameterization at extremely fine Δx [333, 200, and 111 m, hereafter ""Large Eddy Permitting (LEP) runs""] and compares with mesoscale simulations with BL parameterizations (Δx=3 km, 1 km, and 333 m, hereafter ""PBL runs""). There are profound differences in the hurricane BL structure between the PBL and LEP runs: the former have a deeper inflow layer and secondary eyewall formation, whereas the latter have a shallow inflow layer without a secondary eyewall. Among the LEP runs, decreased Δx yields weaker subgrid-scale vertical momentum fluxes, but the sum of subgrid-scale and ""grid-scale"" fluxes remain similar. There is also evidence that the size of the prevalent BL eddies depends upon Δx, suggesting that convergence to true LES has not yet been reached. Nevertheless, the similarities in the storm-scale BL structure among the LEP runs indicate that the net effect of the BL on the rest of the hurricane may be somewhat independent of Δx. Key Points:: TC simulations with and without a BL scheme are substantially different TC BL features are sensitive to grid spacing and choice of SGS parameterization Despite differences among LEP runs the net effect on TC evolution may be similar. © 2015.

According to previous studies, dust stabilizes the atmosphere due to absorption of solar radiation but thus shifts convection to regions more conducive for hurricane genesis. Here we analyze differences in hurricane genesis and frequency from ensemble sensitivity simulations with radiatively active and inactive dust in the aerosol-climate model ECHAM6-HAM. We investigate dust burden and other hurricane-related variables and determine their influence on disturbances which develop into hurricanes (developing disturbances, DDs) and those which do not (nondeveloping disturbances, NDDs). Dust and the SAL are found to potentially have both inhibiting and supporting influences on background conditions for hurricane genesis. A slight southward shift of DDs is determined when dust is active as well as a significant warming of the SAL, which leads to a strengthening of the vertical circulation associated with the SAL. The dust burden of DDs is smaller in active dust simulations compared to DDs in simulations with inactive dust, while NDDs contain more dust in active dust simulations. However, no significant influence of radiatively active dust on other variables in DDs and NDDs is found. Furthermore, no substantial change in the DD and NDD frequency due to the radiative effects of dust can be detected. ©2015. American Geophysical Union.

Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model 24 h forecasts for 96 member ensembles provide the basis for analyses of hurricanes Bill (2009), Earl (2010), Igor (2010), Katia (2011) and Ophelia (2011). Ensemble sensitivity analysis is used to investigate which patterns in the analysis have a strong influence on the forecast intensity and then a novel sensitivity compositing technique is used to identify common patterns that affect the forecast intensity. We find a common response for increasing intensity associated with an initial increased primary and secondary circulation, an increased warm core, an elevated tropopause and moistening of the rain-band region. Perturbed initial-condition experiments show a linear response for modest initial amplitude and also signs of nonlinearity for large perturbations, indicating that these sensitivity patterns are robust for limited additional strengthening of the hurricane. When initial perturbations are partitioned into dry and moist variables, we find that most of the forecast change is achieved by the dry dynamics. Further investigation into convective indicators reveals that simulations in which only moist variables are perturbed experience less convective development in the eyewall throughout the forecast. © 2015 Royal Meteorological Society.","Ensemble sensitivity; Hurricanes; Numerical modelling; Rapid intensification; Tropical cyclones; Typhoons",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928037124

This novel study investigates the effect of gusty hurricane wind forces on the driving behavior and vehicle performance. The study explores how the parameters of a driving simulator could be modified to reproduce wind loadings experienced by three vehicle types (passenger car, ambulance, and bus) during gusty hurricane winds, through manipulation of appropriate software. Thirty participants were then tested on the modified driving simulator under five wind conditions (ranging from normal to hurricane category 4). The driving performance measures used were heading error and lateral displacement. The results showed that higher wind forces resulted in more varied and greater heading error and lateral displacement. The ambulance had the greatest heading errors and lateral displacements, which were attributed to its large lateral surface area and light weight. Two mathematical models were developed to estimate the heading error and lateral displacements for each of the vehicle types for a given change in lateral wind force. Through a questionnaire, participants felt the different characteristics while driving each vehicle type. The findings of this study demonstrate the valuable use of a driving simulator to model the behavior of different vehicle types and to develop mathematical models to estimate and quantify driving behavior and vehicle performance under hurricane wind conditions.","Driving behavior; Driving simulator; Hurricanes; Vehicle performance; Wind forces","Knabb, R.D., Rhome, J.R., Brown, D.P., Hurricane Katrina.

To minimize flood damages associated with large hurricane-season storms, it is important to be able to predict streamflow amount in response to storms for a range of hydroclimatological conditions. However, this is challenging considering that streamflow response exhibits appreciable variability even for hurricane-season storms that deliver similar precipitation amounts. As such, better estimates of event responses require refined understanding of the causes of flood response variability. Here, a physically based, distributed hydrologic model and supporting hydrologic datasets are used to identify and evaluate dominant hydrologic controls on streamflow amount variability. The analysis indicates that variability in flood response in the Lake Michie watershed is primarily driven by antecedent soil moisture conditions near the land surface and evapotranspiration during postevent streamflow recession periods, which in turn is a function of precipitation history and prevailing vegetation and meteorological conditions. Presented results and ensuing analyses could help prioritize measurements during observation campaigns and could aid in risk management by providing look-up diagrams to quickly evaluate flood responses given prior information about hurricane storm size. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.","Hurricanes/typhoons; Hydrologic models; Hydrology; Hydrometeorology","Ashley, S.T., Ashley, W.S., Flood fatalities in the United States (2008) J.

Hurricane wind, storm surge with waves, and inland flooding have unique damage signatures, further complicating the development of robust automated assessment methodologies. As a step toward realizing automated damage assessment for multi-hazard hurricane events, this paper presents a mono-temporal image classification methodology that quickly and accurately differentiates urban debris from non-debris areas using post-event images. Three classification approaches are presented: spectral, textural, and combined spectral–textural. The methodology is demonstrated for Gulfport, Mississippi, using IKONOS panchromatic satellite and NOAA aerial colour imagery collected after 2005 Hurricane Katrina. The results show that multivariate texture information significantly improves debris class detection performance by decreasing the confusion between debris and other land cover types, and the extracted debris zone accurately captures debris distribution. Additionally, the extracted debris boundary is approximately equivalent regardless of imagery type, demonstrating the flexibility and robustness of the debris mapping methodology. While the test case presents results for hurricane hazards, the proposed methodology is generally developed and expected to be effective in delineating debris zones for other natural hazards, including tsunamis, tornadoes, and earthquakes. © 2015 Taylor & Francis",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922982912

In this report, we have extended these studies and compared the toxic effects of fungal VOCs emitted from living cultures of four molds isolated after Hurricane Katrina from a flooded home in New Orleans. Strains of Aspergillus, Mucor, Penicillium, and Trichoderma were grown with wild-type larvae and the toxic effects of volatile products on the developmental stages of Drosophila larvae were evaluated. Furthermore, heterozygous mutants of Drosophila carrying the apoptotic genes, reaper and dronc, were used to assess the role of apoptosis in fungal VOCs mediated toxicity. Third-instar larvae of Drosophila carrying these apoptotic genes were exposed to fungal VOCs emitted from growing mold cultures for 10 days. The larval strains carrying apoptopic genes survived longer than the control wild type larvae; moreover, of those that survived, heterozygous reaper and dronc strains progressed to pupae and adult phases more rapidly, suggesting that fungal VOCs may induce apoptotic changes in flies. These data lend support to the use of Drosophila as an inexpensive and genetically versatile toxicological model to investigate the mechanistic basis for some of the human illnesses/symptoms associated with exposure to mold-contaminated indoor air, especially after hurricanes. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Apoptosis; Drosophila melanogaster; Indoor air quality; Molds; Volatile organic compounds","Andersen, B., Frisvad, J.C., Søndergaard, I., Rasmussen, I.S., Larsen, L.S., Association between fungal species and water-damaged building materials (2011) Appl Environ Microbiol, 77, pp. 4180-4188; Araki, A., Kawai, T., Eitaki, Y., Kanazawa, A., Morimoto, K., Nakayama, K., Shibata, E., Kishi, R., Relationship between selected indoor volatile organic compounds, so-called microbial VOC, and the prevalence of mucous membrane symptoms in single family homes (2010) Sci Total Environ, 408, pp. 2208-2215; Arias, A.M., Drosophila melanogaster and the development of biology in the 20th century methods (2008) Mol Biol, 420, pp. 1-25; Barbeau, D.N., Grimsley, L.F., White, L.E., El-Dahr, J.M., Lichtveld, M., Mold exposure and health effects following hurricanes Katrina and Rita (2010) Annu Rev Public Health, 31, pp. 165-178; Bloom, E., Grimsley, L.F., Pehrson, C., Lewis, J., Larsson, L., Molds and mycotoxins in dust from water-damaged homes in New Orleans after hurricane Katrina (2009) Indoor Air, 19, pp. 153-158; Chung, K.C., Stock, T.H., Smith, L.A., Afshar, M., Liao, X.L., Stallings, C., Post-Hurricane Katrina passive sampling of ambient volatile organic compounds in the greater New Orleans area (2009) Environ Res, 109, pp. 943-951; Epstein, P.R., Climate change and human health (2005) N Engl J Med, 353, pp. 1433-1436; Fan, T.J., Han, L.H., Cong, R.S., Liang, J., Caspase family proteases and apoptosis (2005) Acta Biochim Biophys Sin, 37, pp. 719-727; Hodgson, M.J., Sick building syndrome (2000) Occup Med, 15, pp. 571-585; Inamdar, A.A., Masurekar, P., Benett, J.W., Neurotoxicity of fungal volatile organic compounds in Drosophila melanogaster (2010) Toxicol Sci, 117, pp. 418-426; Inamdar, A.A., Moore, J.C., Cohen, R.I., Bennett, J.W., A model to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the fungal volatile organic compound 1-octen-3-o1 in human embryonic stem cells (2012) Mycopathologia, 173, pp. 13-20; Inamdar, A.A., Zaman, T., Morath, S.U., Pu, D.C., Bennett, J.W., Drosophila melanogaster as a model to characterize fungal volatile organic compounds (2012) Environ Toxicol., , [Epub ahead of print]; Inamdar, A.A., Masurekar, P., Hossain, M., Richardson, J.R., Benett, J.W., Signaling pathways involved in 1-octen-3-ol-mediated neurotoxicity in Drosophila melanogaster: Implication in Parkinson's disease (2013) Neurotox Res; Inamdar, A.A., Hossain, M.M., Bernstein, A.I., Miller, G.W., Richardson, J.R., Bennett, J.W., (2013) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 110, pp. 19561-19566; (2004) Damp Indoor Spaces and Health, , Washington, DC: The National Academies Press; Kondo, F., Ikai, Y., Goto, T., Ito, Y., Oka, H., Nakazawa, H., Odajima, Y., Kamijima, M., Serum Levels of volatile organic compounds in patients with sick building syndrome (2006) Bull Environ Contam Toxicol, 77, pp. 331-337; Korpi, A., Jarnberg, J., Pasanen, A.L., Microbial volatile organic compounds (2009) Crit Rev Toxicol, 39, pp. 13-193; Korpi, A., Pasanen, A.L., Pasanen, P., Volatile compounds originating from mixed microbial cultures on building materials under various humidity conditions (1998) Appl Environ Microbiol, 64, pp. 2914-2919; Matysik, S., Herbarth, O., Mueller, A., Determination of volatile metabolites originating from mould growth on wall paper and synthetic media (2008) J Microbiol Method, 75, pp. 182-187; Mølhave, L., Liu, Z., Jorgensen, A.H., Perderson, O.F., Kjaergard, S., Sensory and physiological effects on humans of combined exposures to air temperatures and volatile organic compounds (1993) Indoor Air, 3, pp. 155-169; Morath, S.U., Hung, R., Bennett, J.W., Fungal volatile organic compounds: A review with emphasis on their biotechnological potential (2012) Fungal Biol Rev, 26, pp. 73-83; Mølhave, L., (2009) Volatile Organic Compounds and the Sick Building Syndrome.

In all cases, a positive sea-air contrast was observed within the storm inner core (i.e., surface ocean temperature greater than surface air temperature), despite the fact that 6% of the hurricanes exhibited sea surface temperatures (SSTs) less than the 26°C. For the storms sampled in this study, inner-core surface dewpoint temperatures never exceeded 26.5°C. This finding may provide an alternate explanation as to the criticality of the 26°C threshold since SSTs above 26°C would, in almost all instances, be associated with a positive enthalpy flux condition.Analyses from this study also illustrate that high wind SSTs fluctuate as a function of storm latitude, while inner-core near-surface dewpoint temperatures are much less sensitive to this parameter. As a result, and assuming all other factors to be equal, low-latitude hurricanes would, on average, be expected to experience surface moisture fluxes ~1/3 greater than storms located farther to the north. For systems sampled within the deep tropics, inner-core SST was found to fluctuate much less than surface dewpoint temperature, suggesting that the atmosphere, not the ocean, is more likely to influence the key thermodynamic parameter controlling surface moisture flux for this subset of hurricanes. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.","Air-sea interaction; Model evaluation/performance; Sea surface temperature; Surface layer; Thermodynamics; Tropical cyclones","Barnes, G.M., Zipser, E.J., Jorgensen, D., Marks, F., Jr., Mesoscale and convective structure of a hurricane rainband (1983) J.

Motivated by Lagrangian float observations of bulk vertical velocity variance (VVV) under Hurricane Gustav (2008), upper-ocean turbulence is investigated based on large-eddy simulation (LES) of the wave-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. To realistically capture wind- and wave-driven Langmuir turbulence (LT), the LES model imposes the Stokes drift vector from spectral wave simulations; both the LES and wave model are forced by the NOAA Hurricane Research Division (HRD) surface wind analysis product. Results strongly suggest that without LT effects simulated VVV underestimates the observed VVV. LT increases the VVV, indicating that it plays a significant role in upper-ocean turbulence dynamics. Consistent with observations, the LES predicts a suppression ofVVVnear the hurricane eye due to wind-wave misalignment. However, this decrease is weaker and of shorter duration than that observed, potentially due to large-scale horizontal advection not present in the LES. Both observations and simulations are consistent with a highly variable upper ocean turbulence field beneath tropical cyclone cores. Bulk VVV, a TKE budget analysis, and anisotropy coefficient (ratio of horizontal to vertical velocity variances) profiles all indicate that LT is suppressed to levels closer to that of shear turbulence (ST) due to misaligned wind and wave fields. VVV approximately scales with the directional surface layer Langmuir number. Such a scaling provides guidance for the development of an upper-ocean boundary layer parameterization that explicitly depends on sea state. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.","Atm/Ocean structure/Phenomena; Atmosphere-ocean interaction; Circulation/Dynamics; Large eddy simulations; Mixed layer; Models and modeling; Sea state; Tropical cyclones; Wind waves","Belcher, S.E., A global perspective on Langmuir turbulence in the ocean surface boundary layer (2012) Geophys.

This method involves five steps: (1) construct a GIS-based geotechnical database; (2) identify the areas in the vicinity which are susceptible to translational landslides based on the slope of the terrain and the geological information available; (3) characterize the heavy rainfall hazard due to hurricanes (typhoon) as a set of collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive stochastic events, that fully describe spatial distribution and annual frequency of occurrence (in accordance with storm category, storm position, distance between the eye of the storm and the site of interest, among others factors); (4) compute the ratio between the steady-state rainfall produced by a hurricane event affecting the tributary area of the slope under analysis, Qs, and the critical steady-state rainfall necessary to trigger slope instability, Qc, and finally; (5) carry out a probabilistic translational landslide hazard analysis to estimate the exceedance rate of a given ratio Qs/Qc. This method is applied to maps of Mexico for return periods of 50 and 150 years. The results shown in these maps are estimates of where the translational landslides may occur, and they should be useful to carry out local studies and to elaborate recommendations of site-specific hazard reduction plans as well as to calculate insurance rates. In addition to this, these results are useful for identifying actions of civil protection, regional and local risk management, and land use planning, as well as the promotion of more detailed vulnerability and risk studies on different scales. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Hazard intensity; Hurricane event-based methodology; Landslide hazard assessment; Landslide maps; Translational landslide","Akgun, A., A comparison of landslide susceptibility maps produced by logistic regression, multi-criteria decision, and likelihood ratio methods: a case study at İzmir, Turkey (2012) Landslides, 9, pp. 93-106; Akgun, A., Türk, N., Landslide susceptibility mapping for Ayvalik, (Western Turkey) and its vicinity by multicriteria decision analysis (2010) Environ Earth Sci, 61, pp. 595-611; Alcántara-Ayala, I., On the historical account of disastrous landslides in Mexico: the challenge of risk management and disaster prevention (2008) Adv Geosci, 14, pp. 159-164; Ayalew, L., Yamagishi, H., Marui, H., Kanno, T., Landslides in Sado Island of Japan: part II.

Autumn is also the season when intense rainfall over the Mediterranean is often triggered by Rossby wave breaking. The impact of tropical cyclones on downstream wave breaking is investigated here during three episodes of intense rainfall which were the target of HyMeX (Hydrological cycle in Mediterranean eXperiment) in autumn 2012. Five-day simulations of hurricanes Leslie, Rafael and Sandy were performed with the Meso-NH model in a domain encompassing the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Control simulations were compared to simulations in which the hurricanes were filtered out from the initial conditions. In each case, the hurricane locally impeded the forward progression of an upstream trough, then reintensified as an extratropical cyclone during the wrap-up of the trough. The local impact of Leslie and Rafael on the midlatitude flow quickly propagated downstream along a polar jet and amplified Rossby wave breaking but decreased the intensity of the forecast precipitation over the Mediterranean. The local impact of Sandy propagated downstream along a subtropical jet in addition to the polar jet and resulted in a weak impact of the forecast precipitation on the Mediterranean. This study suggests that the interaction of tropical cyclones with the midlatitude flow over the western North Atlantic may be considered a perturbation to, rather than a source of, downstream wave breaking. © 2014 Royal Meteorological Society.","Downstream development; Filtering; HyMeX; Meso-NH; Rossby wave breaking; Tropical cyclone","Agusti-Panareda, A., Thorncroft, C., Craig, G., Gray, S., The extratropical transition of hurricane Irene (1999): A potential vorticity perspective (2004) Q.

A sinuosity metric is used as the basis for track morphometry, applied to best-track data accessed from the IBTrACs archive maintained by NOAA. GIS tools, track mapping according to sinuosity category, and various statistical analyses permit temporal and spatial patterns in track shape to be identified and investigated. Temporal analysis reveals no underlying long-term trend in track sinuosity over the past 4.5 decades, implying an absence of climatic-change forcing on storm migration behaviour at the basin scale. Instead, large inter-annual variability dominates, although it is possible to observe episodes of notable cyclic swings in average sinuosity towards straighter or more sinuous tracks. Seasonality in track behaviour is pronounced, as similarly reported for other ocean basins. Predictable straight and quasi-straight track types are more common (64-100%) during the early months (May to July) of the hurricane season, with this reversing at the peak and later phase of the season (September, November) to a predominance for quasi-sinuous and sinuous tracks (58-70%). In spatial terms, track morphometric analysis according to 10° longitudinal zone of cyclogenesis is valuable, revealing that storm origin is reasonably indicative of likely track shape over the subsequent lifespan. Thus, while 62-68% of storms spawned west of 80°W in the Caribbean Sea - Gulf of Mexico region show a tendency to follow straighter tracks, 67-72% of storms formed east of 40°W in the central-eastern North Atlantic subsequently describe more sinuous tracks. Overall, these patterns are seen to influence the geographic potential of storm landfall. This is important for societal vulnerability on coastlines at risk, since storms exhibiting higher track sinuosity generally prove to survive longer, migrate farther and therefore display greater potential for inflicting damage over wider areas. © 2014 Royal Meteorological Society.","Hurricanes; Morphometry; North Atlantic; Sinuosity; Storm tracks; Tropical storms","Bender, M.A., Tuleya, R.E., Kurihara, Y., A numerical study of the effect of island terrain on tropical cyclones (1986) Mon.

Furthermore, the interrelationship between the component, the grid, and the associated downtime cost dynamics are incorporated in the problem.

Wind damage is estimated from the known path and wind speeds of individual storms and calibrated to fit actual damage reports for a sample of Gulf Coast storms. Storm surge is estimated using the SLOSH model developed by NOAA. These models provide the first comprehensive overview of the hurricane storm hazard as it has been experienced over a fifty-six-year period. We link the estimated damage with information on the population and specific socio-demographic components of the population (by age, race, and poverty status). Results show that white, young adult, and nonpoor populations have shifted over time away from zones with higher risk of wind damage, while more vulnerable population groups-the elderly, African Americans, and poor-have moved in the opposite direction. All groups have moved away from areas with high risk of storm surge since 1970. But in this case, perhaps because living near the water is still perceived as an amenity, those at highest risk are whites, elderly, and nonpoor households. Here exposure represents a trade-off between the risk and the amenity. © 2015 by the American Geographical Society of New York.","Disaster; Resilience; Risk assessment; Vulnerability","Bolin, B., Race, Class, Ethnicity, and Disaster Vulnerability (2006) Handbook for Disaster Research, pp. 113-129. , edited by H.

Monitoring is required to detect the impact of, and recovery from, perturbations, and before-after-control-impact (BACI) analysis provides a powerful framework in this regard. However, species in a community are not observed with perfect detection, and occupancy analysis is required to correct for imperfect detectability of species. We present a Bayesian community occupancy before-after-controlimpact (CO-BACI) framework to monitor ecological community response to perturbation when constituent species are imperfectly detected. We test the power of the model to detect changes in community composition following an acute perturbation with simulation. We then apply the model to a study of the impact of a large hurricane on the forest bird community of Sweden, using data from the national bird survey scheme. Although simulation shows the model can detect changes in community occupancy following an acute perturbation, application to a Swedish forest bird community following a major hurricane detected no change in community occupancy despite widespread forest loss. Birds with landscape occupancy less than 50% required correcting for detectability. We conclude that CO-BACI analysis is a useful tool that can incorporate rare species in analyses and detect occupancy changes in ecological communities following perturbation, but, because it does not include abundance, some impacts may be overlooked. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.","Bayesian framework;

Isotropic and anisotropic surfaces of Miami, Florida, USA, were derived from tax building age, and LIDAR building height data, to act as a test area for the methodology. The isotropic surface modelled the key vulnerabilities of individual buildings within the study area, whilst the anisotropic surface considered the varying effects due to wind directionality. The results from the model indicate the logical effect of most damage occurring on surfaces that directly face the oncoming wind, and this is only minimised on those surfaces that are sheltered by larger buildings. This directionality effect on results is validated by damage records for actual hurricane events that are recorded in the literature, as well as the patterns observed on Central Miami landmarks after Hurricane Wilma in 2005. These results represent a simplistic GIS approximation of the phenomena in a specific urban environment, which do not take into account more complex factors linked to urban ‘roughness’ and turbulence effects. To model these complexities would require a multidisciplinary approach involving meteorologists and engineers. This research, however, indicates that the vulnerability surface produced by the friction surface analysis has potential as a tool to assess hurricane impact in a selected area which could be of use in implementing mitigation initiatives, disaster recovery planning and assessing financial loss. This represents a deterministic approach, but calibration of the results against building exceedance probability damage curves suggests that this methodology could be correlated with stochastic catastrophe model methodologies. The deterministic nature of the methodology means that it can be used at any location, but the derived friction layers must be carefully considered on a locality-by-locality basis. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Friction surface analysis; GIS; Hurricane; LIDAR; Urban; Vulnerability","https://www.abi.org.uk/~/media/Files/Documents/Publications/Public/2014/prudential%20regulation/Nonmodelled%20risks%20a%20guide%20to%20more%20complete%20catastrophe%20risk%20assessment%20for%20reinsurers.ashx, ABI (2014) Non-modelled risks: a guide to more complete catastrophe risk assessment for (re)insurers.

The coupled HWRF-POM-TC system facilitates accurate tropical cyclone intensity forecasts through proper simulation of the evolving SST field under simulated tropical cyclones. In this study, the 2013 operational version of HWRF is used to analyze the POM-TC ocean temperature response in retrospective HWRF-POM-TC forecasts of Atlantic Hurricanes Earl (2010), Igor (2010), Irene (2011), Isaac (2012), and Leslie (2012) against remotely sensed and in situ SST and subsurface ocean temperature observations. The model generally underestimates the hurricane-induced upper-ocean cooling, particularly far from the storm track, as well as the upwelling and downwelling oscillation in the cold wake, compared with observations. Nonetheless, the timing of the model SST cooling is generally accurate (after accounting for along-track timing errors), and the ocean model's vertical temperature structure is generally in good agreement with observed temperature profiles from airborne expendable bathythermographs. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.",,"Avila, L.A., Best track determination at NHC (2002) 25th Conf. on Hurricanes and TropicalMeteorology, , https://ams.confex.com/ams/25HURR/techprogram/paper_36320.htm, Preprints, SanDiego, CA, Amer.

How do pregnant women fare in the aftermath of a major disaster? This paper investigates the effect of pregnancies in disaster situations. The study tests a hypothesis that pregnant women residing in hurricane-prone areas suffer higher health risks. The setting is Louisiana in the Gulf Coast, United States, a state that continually experiences hurricane impacts. The time period for the analysis is three years following the landfall of Hurricane Andrew in 1992. We analysed low birth weight and preterm deliveries before and after landfall, as a whole and by race. Findings support an association between hazards and health of a community and indicate that pregnant women in the affected area, irrespective of race, are more likely to experience preterm deliveries compared to pre-event births. Results suggest there is a negative health legacy impact in Louisiana as a result of hurricane landfall. © Overseas Development Institute, 2015.","Disaster; Hurricane Andrew; Louisiana; Pregnancy outcomes; Public health",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924037606

Following the effects of Hurricane Sandy in the continental North America (USA and Canada) and the Caribbean, the purpose of this paper is to examine the mortality caused by the hurricane, focussing on differences in human vulnerability between these two regions.Design/methodology/approach: The authors developed a database of 233 deaths, consisting of variables that provided a description of the circumstances under which the fatal incidents occurred and demographic details of the victims.Findings: Analysis of the database showed higher percentages of female and young victims in the Caribbean than in continental North America, where mortality increased progressively with age and the ratio of males to females was higher. The majority of deaths occurred outdoors especially during clean-up and in vehicle crashes related to the storm. Physical trauma and drowning were identified as the most common causes of death, followed by carbon monoxide poisoning, hypothermia and others, although substantially different percentages were recorded between the two regions. Overall, indirect deaths presented a higher percentage than direct ones. Among the latter, incidents caused by storm surge and tree falls showed the highest numbers. Power failure and car crashes were the most common cause of indirect incidents.Originality/value: The paper provides a thorough analysis of the circumstances under which fatal incidents occurred. It identifies parameters that affected the vulnerability of human life to the storm and discusses the differences between the Caribbean and continental North America. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Caribbean;

While there are many similarities between the American rescue operation and the one in Uttrakhand, many striking differences also exist. The great majority of responders in both the areas came from the military forces of each respective country and was augmented by civilian helicopters and crews in both locations. From across the country of India, civilian helicopter operators converged on the area, aiding military pilots and crews who had already commenced rescue operations as part of Operation Surya Hope and Operation Rahat. Similarly, helicopters from the Louisiana National Guard, the US Coast Guard, and all branches of the military, joined together to take part in rescue operations in hurricane Katrina. A great difference between these two disasters was the actual areas of operations. While Uttarakhand was a high altitude, mountainous environment, Katrina was a low altitude coastal environment. In Uttarakhand, the helicopters carried out their mission in hazardous, mountain conditions, often in rain or fog.

These Puerto Rican montane rain forests were impacted strongly by hurricanes in 1989 and 1998, so the surveys in the 1990s represented 4-8 yr of post-hurricane recovery, whereas our recent survey represents 12 yr of post-hurricane recovery. At most elevations, species diversity, both within individual bromeliads and at the forest scale, declined between the 1990s and 2010. This decline in diversity between decades is associated with reductions in bromeliad density as the canopy progressively closed during recovery from hurricane damage. The observed decline in alpha and gamma diversity appears to have involved the loss of rarer species, as might be expected from standard metapopulation theory. By contrast, the most common species were remarkably stable in abundance, composition, and frequency of occurrence over the two decades. In the lowermost tabonuco forest, two endemic bromeliad specialists, restricted to bromeliads for their entire life cycle, were not found on resampling. This study also demonstrates that, at least in Puerto Rico, sets of ten plants from each forest were sufficient to monitor bromeliad invertebrate populations and their diversity over time. © 2015 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.","Community change; Diversity; Guzmania; Habitat loss; Habitat monitoring; Tank bromeliad; Vriesea","Araújo, V.A., Melo, S.K., Araújo, A.P.A., Gomes, M.L.M., Carneiro, M.A.A., Relationship between invertebrate fauna and bromeliad size (2007) Brazilian Journal of Biology, 67, pp. 611-617; Armbruster, P., Hutchinson, R.A., Cotgreave, P., Factors influencing community structure in a South American tank bromeliad fauna (2002) Oikos, 96 (225-234), p. 2002; Benzing, D.H., Foliar specializations for animal assisted nutrition in Bromeliaceae (1986) Insects and the plant surface, pp. 235-256. , In B.

The forecast verification shows that HWRF captured well Earl's observed evolution of intensity, convection asymmetry, wind field asymmetry, and vortex tilt in terms of magnitude and direction in the pre rapid and rapid intensification (RI) stages. Examination of the high-resolution forecast data reveals that the tilt was large at the RI onset and decreased quickly once RI commenced, suggesting that vertical alignment is the result instead of the trigger for RI. The RI onset is associated with the development of upper-level warming in the eye, which results from upper-level storm-relative flow advecting the warm air caused by subsidence warming in the upshear-left region toward the low-level storm center. This scenario does not occur until persistent convective bursts (CB) are concentrated in the downshear-left quadrant. The temperature budget calculation indicates that horizontal advection plays an important role in the development of upper-level warming in the early RI stage. The upperlevel warming associated with the asymmetric intensification process occurs by means of the cooperative interaction of the convective-scale subsidence, resulting from CBs in favored regions and the shear-induced mesoscale subsidence. When CBs are concentrated in the downshear-left and upshear-left quadrants, the subsidence warming is maximized upshear and then advected toward the low-level storm center by the stormrelative flow at the upper level. Subsequently, the surface pressure falls and RI occurs. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.",,"Black, P.G., Ocean temperature changes induced by tropical cyclones (1983), p. 278. , Ph.D. dissertation, The Pennsylvania State University, [Available from The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802Byers, H.R., (1944) General Meteorology, p. 645. , -Hill; Cangialosi, J.P., Tropical cyclone report: Hurricane Earl, 25 August-4 September 2010 (2010), p. 29. , http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCRAL072010_Earl.pdfCangialosi, J.P., Franklin, J.L., 2010 National Hurricane Center forecast verification report (2011), p. 77. , http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/pdfs/Verification_2010.pdf, NOAA/NHC Tech.

Hurricane Igor generated a storm surge of almost 1 m at St. John's and about 0.8 m at three nearby coastal tide gauge stations (Bonavista, Argentia and St. Lawrence). The surge magnitude from the 3-D baroclinic model agrees approximately with tide-gauge observations at all four stations, slightly better than that from an alternative 3-D barotropic case. The sudden drop of sea surface temperature caused by the storm, approximately 6°C as observed by buoys, is well simulated by the baroclinic model with a k-ε turbulence closure. A sensitivity simulation with the Mellor-Yamada turbulence closure significantly underestimates sea surface cooling. It is shown that the sea surface cooling is mainly associated with turbulent mixing, and to a lesser degree with Ekman upwelling. The model solution shows that the largest surge occurred between Bonavista and St. John's. Further analysis suggests the generation of a free continental shelf wave after the storm made landfall, with the peak surge propagating from St. John's to St. Lawrence. © 2015.

Numerical simulations show that the model-generated dust plume modifies the thermal field, causing a clockwise turning of the vertical shear surrounding the plume, which changes the deep layer steering flow. The change in the steering flow modifies Helene's moving speed and direction as it transits the plume. As Helene exits the plume, it has a different trajectory than it would have had in the absence of dust-radiative forcing. Consequently, the difference in the tracks with and without dust-radiative forcing continues to grow with distance from the plume. The dust-induced changes in temperature and wind together cause Helene's modeled storm track to be in closer agreement with the observed track; the dust-radiative forcing reduces the error in the model's 7-day track forecasts by an average of 27% (∼205 km). © 2015 Royal Meteorological Society.","Dust model; Dust-radiative forcing; Hurricane track; Saharan dust",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927144073

Medical charts were also reviewed to obtain information about pregnancy outcomes. Logistic regression was performed to determine possible associations. Results: Hurricane exposure was significantly associated with induction of labor (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.03, 1.86], P = .03) and current perceived stress (aOR = 1.50, CI [1.34, 1.99], P < .01). Stress perception significantly predisposed to pregnancy-induced hypertension (aOR = 1.16, CI [1.05, 1.30], P < .01) and gestational diabetes (aOR = 1.13, CI [1.02, 1.25], P = .03). Use of planning, acceptance, humor, instrumental support, and venting coping styles were associated with a significantly reduced occurrence of pregnancy complications (P < .05). Higher rates for gestational diabetes was found among women using the denial coping style (aOR = 2.25, CI [1.14, 4.45], P = .02). Conclusion: Exposure to disaster-related stress may complicate pregnancy, whereas some coping styles may mitigate its effects. Further research should explore how coping styles may mitigate or exacerbate the effect of major stressors and how positive coping styles can be encouraged or augmented. © 2015 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses.","Cesarean; Coping styles; Gestational diabetes; Hurricane Katrina; Induction of labor; Pregnancy-induced hypertension; Stress","Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus (2009) Diabetes Care, 32, pp. S62-S67; Andreou, E., Alexopoulos, E.C., Lionis, C., Varvogli, L., Gnardellis, C., Chrousos, G.P., Darviri, C., Perceived Stress Scale: Reliability and validity study in Greece (2011) International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 8, pp. 3287-3298; Anorlu, R.I., Iwuala, N.C., Odum, C.U., Risk factors for pre-eclampsia in Lagos, Nigeria (2005) Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, 45, pp. 278-282; Aspinwall, L.G., Taylor, S.E., A stitch in time: Self-regulation and proactive coping (1997) Psychological Bulletin, 121, pp. 417-436; Boyle, A., Reddy, U.M., Epidemiology of cesarean delivery: The scope of the problem (2012) Seminars in Perinatology, 36, pp. 308-314; Brown, M.A., Social support, stress, and health: A comparison of expectant mothers and fathers (1986) Nursing Research, 35, pp. 72-76; Carver, C.S., You want to measure coping but your protocol's too long: Consider the brief COPE (1997) International Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 4, pp. 92-100; Carver, C.S., Scheier, M.F., Weintraub, J.K., Assessing coping strategies: A theoretically based approach (1989) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56, pp. 267-283; (2014), http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/MaternalInfantHealth/PregComplications.htm, (, January 22).

Rapid intensification occurs in two stages. During the early stage, covering ~24 h, Earl was a tropical storm experiencing moderate northeasterly shear with an asymmetric distribution of convection, and the symmetric structure was shallow, broad, and diffuse. The upper-level circulation center was significantly displaced from the lower-level circulation at the beginning of this stage. Deep, vigorous convection-termed convective bursts-was located on the east side of the storm and appeared to play a role in positioning the upper-level cyclonic circulation center above the low-level center.By the end of this stage the vortex was aligned and extended over a deep layer, and rapid intensification began. During the late stage, rapid intensification continued as Earl intensified ~20ms-1 during the next 24 h. The vortex remained aligned in the presence of weaker vertical shear, although azimuthal asymmetries persisted that were characteristic of vortices in shear. Convective bursts concentrated near the radius ofmaximumwinds,with themajority located inside the radius of maximum winds. Each of the two stages described here raises questions about the role of convective- and vortex-scale processes in rapid intensification.During the early stage, the focus is on the role of convective bursts and their associated mesoscale convective system on vortex alignment and the onset of rapid intensification. During the late stage, the focus is on the processes that explain the observed radial distribution of convective bursts that peak inside the radius of maximum winds. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.",,"Bartels, D.L., Maddox, R.A., Midlevel cyclonic vortices generated by mesoscale convective systems (1991) Mon.

During Earl's rapid intensification (RI) period, ocean heat content (OHC) variability relative to the 26°Cisotherm exceeded 90 kJ cm-2, and sea surface cooling was less than 0.5°C. Enthalpy fluxes of ~ 1.1 kWm-2 were estimated for Earl's peak intensity. Daily sea surface heat losses of -6.5±0.8, -7.8±1.1, and +2.3±0.7 kJcm-2 were estimated for RI, mature, and weakening stages, respectively. A ratio CK/CD of the exchange coefficients of enthalpy (CK) and momentum (CD) between 0.54 and 0.7 produced reliable estimates for the fluxes relative to OHC changes, even during RI; a ratio CK/CD 51 overestimated the fluxes. The most important result is that bulk enthalpy fluxes were controlled by the thermodynamic disequilibrium between the sea surface and the near-surface air, independently of wind speed. This disequilibrium was strongly influenced by underlying warm oceanic features; localized maxima in enthalpy fluxes developed over tight horizontal gradients of moisture disequilibrium over these eddy features. These regions of local buoyant forcing preferentially developed during RI. The overall magnitude of the moisture disequilibrium (Δq=qs-qa) was determined by the saturation specific humidity at sea surface temperature (qs) rather than by the specific humidity of the atmospheric environment (qa). These results support the hypothesis that intense local buoyant forcing by the ocean could be an important intensification mechanism in tropical cyclones over warm oceanic features. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.",,"Bell, M.M., Montgomery, M.T., Emanuel, K.A., Air-sea enthalpy and momentum exchange at major hurricane wind speeds observed during CBLAST (2012) J.

Using a new version of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) coupled model, the authors studied the predictability of two destructive landfall TCs: Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. Results demonstrate that the geneses of these two TCs are highly predictable with the maximumprediction lead time reaching 11 days. The ""beyond weather time scale"" predictability of tropical cyclogenesis is primarily attributed to the model's skillful prediction of the intraseasonal Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and the westward propagation of easterly waves. Meanwhile, the landfall location and time can be predicted one week ahead for Sandy's U.S landfall, and two weeks ahead for Haiyan's landing in the Philippines. The success in predicting Sandy and Haiyan, together with low false alarms, indicates the potential of using the GFDL coupled model for extended-range predictions of TCs. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.",,"Barnes, E.A., Polvani, L.M., Sobel, A.H., Model projections of atmospheric steering of Sandy-like superstorms (2013) Proc.

Because approximately 80% of the city was under sea level, widespread flooding ensued. As a resident of New Orleans who had evacuated before the storm and a life-long researcher on filamentous fungi, I had known what to expect. After the hurricane I traveled home with a suitcase full of Petri dishes and sampling equipment so as to study the fungi that were ""eating my house."" Not only were surfaces covered with fungal growth, the air itself was full of concentrated mold odor, a smell that was orders of magnitude more funky than any damp, musty basement I had ever encountered. The smell made me feel bad and I had to take regular breaks as I sampled. Being a mycotoxin expert, I knew a fair amount about ""sick building syndrome"" but believed that it was difficult to get enough respiratory exposure to toxins to cause the array of symptoms associated with the syndrome. So why was I feeling sick? Some Scandinavian experts had hypothesized that mold volatile organic compounds (VOCs) might be the fungal metabolites to blame for sick building syndrome and the time in my smelly, mold infested home made me think they might be right. After securing a new job and establishing a new laboratory, I endeavored to test the hypothesis that some volatile mold metabolites might be toxic. My laboratory at Rutgers University has interrogated the role of VOCs in possible interkingdom toxicity by developing controlled microcosms for exposing simple genetic model organisms to the vapor phase of growing fungi. Both Arabidopsis thaliana and Drosophila melanogaster exhibit a range of toxic symptoms that vary with the species of fungus, the duration of exposure, and other experimental parameters. Moreover, low concentrations of chemical standards of individual fungal VOCs such as 1-octen-3-ol also exhibit varying toxicity and cause neurotoxicity in a Drosophila model. Collectively, these data suggest that fungal VOCs may contribute to some of the adverse health effects reported by people exposed to damp indoor environments and that biogenic gas phase molecules deserve increased attention by the research community. © 2015 Bennett.","1-octen-3-ol (mushroom alcohol); Aspergillus; Double petri plate system; Sick building syndrome; Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)","Bennett, J.W., Hung, R., Lee, S., Padhi, S., 'Fungal and bacterial volatile organic compounds; an overview and their role as ecological signaling agents' (2013) The Mycota IX Fungal Interactions, pp. 373-393. , ed.

However, prior research and theory suggest that the modal postdisaster response in each of these domains is resilience, defined as low levels of symptoms or problems in a given outcome over time, with minimal elevations that are limited to the time period during the disaster and its immediate aftermath. However, the extent to which disaster survivors exhibit mental health wellness (resilience across multiple mental health conditions) or general wellness (resilience across mental health, physical health, and role functioning domains) remains unexplored. The purpose of this study was to quantify mental health and general wellness, and to examine predictors of each form of wellness, in a three-wave population-based study of Hurricane Ike survivors (N=658). Latent class growth analysis was used to determine the frequency of resilience on four outcomes (PTSS: 74.9%; depression: 57.9%; functional impairment: 45.1%; days of poor health: 52.6%), and cross-tabulations were used to determine the frequency of mental health wellness (51.2%) and general wellness (26.1%). Significant predictors of both mental health and general wellness included lower peri-event emotional reactions and higher community-level collective efficacy; loss of sentimental possessions or pets and disaster-related financial loss were negative predictors of mental health wellness, and loss of personal property was a negative predictor of general wellness. The results suggest that studies focusing on a single postdisaster outcome may have overestimated the prevalence of mental health and general wellness, and that peri-event responses, personal property loss and collective efficacy have a cross-cutting influence across multiple domains of postdisaster functioning. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Mental health; Natural disasters; Physical health; Resilience; Role functioning; Wellness","(2011) Standard Definitions:Final Dispositions of Case Codes and Outcome Rates for Surveys, , AAPOR; Barrera, M., Sandler, I.N., Ramsay, T.B., Preliminary development of a scale of social support: studies on college students (1981) Am.

Here, dynamical processes responsible for the eastward-tracking forecasts are diagnosed using an 80-member ensemble of experimental Global Forecast System (GFS) forecasts initialized five days prior to landfall. Comparing the ensemble members with tracks to the east against those with tracks to the west indicates that the eastern members were characterized by a lower-amplitude upper-tropospheric anticyclone on the poleward side of Sandy during the first 24 h of the forecast, which in turn was associated with a westerly perturbation steering wind. The amplification of this ridge in each set of members was modulated by differences in the advection of potential vorticity (PV) by the irrotational wind associated with Sandy's secondary circulation and isentropic lift along a warm front that formed on the poleward side of Sandy. The amplitude of the irrotational wind in this region was proportional to the 0-h water vapor mixing ratio, and to a lesser extent the 0-h upper-tropospheric horizontal divergence. These two quantities modulated the vertical profile of grid-scale condensation within the model and subsequent upper-tropospheric divergence. The results from this study suggest that additional observations within regions of large-scale precipitation outside the tropical cyclone (TC) core could benefit TC track forecasts, particularly when the TC is located near an upper-tropospheric PV gradient. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.",,"Aberson, S.D., Targeted observations to improve operational tropical cyclone track forecast guidance (2003) Mon.

The gelding developed neurological signs and was subjected to euthanasia; necropsy was consistent with Salmonella sepsis and disseminated mycosis due to Candida krusei, the first case reported in a horse. Case 2 presented with dermatitis attributable to chemical exposure and pneumonia and was subjected to euthanasia due to severe bilateral laminitis. Case 3 sustained a degloving injury of the left hindlimb and was subjected to euthanasia due to intractable pain.

Although numerous efforts have sought to explain the determinants of disaster resilience, the ability to measure the concept is increasingly being seen as a key step toward disaster risk reduction. The development of standards that are meaningful for measuring resilience remains a challenge, however. This is partially because there are few explicit sets of procedures within the literature that outline how to measure and compare communities in terms of their resilience. The primary purpose of this article is to advance the understanding of the multidimensional nature of disaster resilience and to provide an externally validated set of metrics for measuring resilience at subcounty levels of geography. A set of metrics covering social, economic, institutional, infrastructural, community-based, and environmental dimensions of resilience was identified, and the validity of the metrics is addressed via real-world application using Hurricane Katrina and the recovery of the Mississippi Gulf Coast in the United States as a case study. © 2015, © 2015 by Association of American Geographers.","composite indicators;

The development and validation of ocean and sediment transport models is necessary to interpret short-term events on the long-term sediment record. Numerous studies have used pre- and post-storm surveys to validate three-dimensional sediment resuspension and transport models, but due to extreme sampling conditions in situ validation has been limited to a few point measurements. Over the last decade many of the acoustic and optical sensors used on tripods and benthic landers have been developed for, and included on, autonomous underwater vehicles. In this study we use a combination of the Regional Ocean Modeling System and a Teledyne-Webb Slocum glider as well as other regional ocean observing assets to characterize sediment transport on the New Jersey continental shelf during Hurricane Sandy in October of 2012. © 2014 IEEE.","Ocean Modeling; Ocean observing systems; Sediment transport","Cacchione, D., Grant, W., Storm-dominated bottom boundary layer dynamics on the northern california continental shelf: Measurements and predictions (1987) J.

A Teledyne-Webb Slocum glider, equipped with a Nortek Aquadopp current profiler, was deployed on the continental shelf ahead of the storm, and is used to validate sediment transport routines coupled to the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The glider was deployed on 25 October, 5 days before Sandy made landfall in southern New Jersey (NJ) and flew along the 40 m isobath south of the Hudson Shelf Valley. We used optical and acoustic backscatter to compare with two modeled size classes along the glider track, 0.1 and 0.4 mm sand, respectively. Observations and modeling revealed full water column resuspension for both size classes for over 24 h during peak waves and currents, with transport oriented along-shelf toward the southwest. Regional model predictions showed over 3 cm of sediment eroded on the northern portion of the NJ shelf where waves and currents were the highest. As the storm passed and winds reversed from onshore to offshore on the southern portion of the domain waves and subsequently orbital velocities necessary for resuspension were reduced leading to over 3 cm of deposition across the entire shelf, just north of Delaware Bay. This study highlights the utility of gliders as a new asset in support of the development and verification of regional sediment resuspension and transport models, particularly during large tropical and extratropical cyclones when in situ data sets are not readily available. © 2015.

Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted in March 2012. Continuous uncertainty, along with Katrina-related stressful events, negatively impacted the survivors' psychological well-being. Leisure had four distinct meanings in their coping and adjustment processes, providing (a) a positive distraction, (b) an opportunity to stay optimistic and hopeful, (c) a source of new normalcy at both societal and individual levels, and (d) a context for positive inner changes. Additionally, Japanese unique perspectives and attitudes (e.g., quietness, humbleness, modesty) facilitated certain coping strategies. Overall, this study provided evidence for the role of leisure in meaning-making as a key function of coping and adjustment.","Culture; Disaster; Leisure; Meaning; Stress","Atchley, R.C., Continuity theory of normal aging (1989) The Gerontologist, 29 (2), pp. 183-190; Badakhsh, R., Harville, E., Banerjee, B., The childbearing experience during a natural disaster (2010) Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic and Neonatal Nursing, 39, pp. 489-497; Chun, S., Lee, Y., The role of leisure in the experience of posttraumatic growth for people with spinal cord injury (2010) Journal of Leisure Research, 42 (3), pp. 393-415; Desalvo, K.B., Hyre, A.D., Ompad, D.C., Menke, A., Tynes, L.L., Muntner, P., Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in a New Orleans workforce following Hurricane Katrina (2007) Journal of Urban Health, 84 (2), pp. 142-152; Dugan, B., Loss of identity in disaster: How do you say goodbye to home?

While the operational European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model accurately depicted a northeastern United States landfall, the Global Forecasting System (GFS) model consistently forecast a track toward the North Atlantic Ocean. Using a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model framework, Bassill () suggested that these differences were primarily a function of differences between the two models' cumulus parameterization (CP). This study also uses a WRF model framework to examine the simplified Arakawa Schubert CP used in the GFS model. It is found that increasing the deep convective entrainment coefficient produces more realistic forecast tracks for forecasts initialized roughly 1week before landfall. This occurs through a reorientation of the precipitation (and associated latent heating) around Sandy during a critical time period in which it was interacting with a series of upper troughs to its west and northwest. Reorienting the latent heating reshapes the upper tropospheric steering pattern toward the one that is more negatively tilted and consistent with observations. ©2014. American Geophysical Union.

As wrack decomposes or is relocated by a subsequent hurricane, patches are opened to colonization. We postulated that patterns of wrack deposition and removal, coupled with differential responses by savanna plant species should produce alternate states of groundcover vegetation. We explored extreme effects of wrack deposited by Hurricane Katrina (2005) in savannas dominated by slash pine Pinus elliottii and cordgrass Spartina patens and located above mean high tide at the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, Mississippi, USA. In 2008, we established plots in adjacent areas with and without wrack deposits. Almost no groundcover plant species occurred in wrack deposits compared to adjacent groundcover without wrack. We simulated redistribution of wrack during a new storm surge by removing wrack from replicated plots and depositing it in plots without wrack, recording plant species in treatment and control plots before, then one month and one year after manipulations. One year later, about half the species present before wrack addition (especially dominant graminoids) grew back through redistributed wrack, suggesting that some species were resistant to burial of limited amounts of wrack. Wrack removal resulted in germination and establishment of numerous herbaceous plant species not in undisturbed groundcover, doubling total aboveground numbers of species in the pine savanna and shifting groundcover communities to alternate states not present prior to Katrina. Removal of wrack opens space colonized by resilient species, including those transported in wrack and those surviving intervals between disturbances belowground. Wrack dynamics (deposition and removal) generated alternate states that resulted from resistance- and resilience-driven changes in different patches of groundcover in coastal savannas. © 2014 The Authors.",,"Baldwin, A.H., Mendelssohn, I.A., Response of two oligohaline marsh communities to lethal and nonlethal disturbance (1998) Oecologia, 116, pp. 543-555; Baskin, C.C., Baskin, J.M., (2001) Seeds: ecology, biogeography, and evolution of dormancy and germination, , Academic Press; Baskin, C.C., Seed dormancy in the wetland winter annual Ptilimnium nuttallii (Apiaceae) (1999) Wetlands, 19, pp. 359-364; Batista, W.B., Platt, W.J., Tree population response to hurricane disturbance: syndromes in a southeastern United States old-growth forest (2003) J.

However, time-dependent storm surge models do not exist for fast and accurate prediction in very short periods on the order of seconds to minutes. In this paper, a time-dependent surrogate model of storm surge is developed based on an artificial neural network with synthetic simulations of hurricanes. The neural network between six input hurricane parameters and one target parameter, storm surge, is trained by a feedforward backpropagation algorithm at each of 92 uniform time steps spanning 45.5 h for each storm. The basis data consist of 446 tropical storms developed from a joint probability model that was based on historical tropical storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Each of the 446 storms was modeled at high fidelity using a coupled storm surge and nearshore wave model. Storm surge is predicted by the 92 trained networks for approaching hurricane climatological and track parameters in a few seconds. Furthermore, the developed surrogate model is validated with measured data and high-fidelity simulations of two historical hurricanes at four points in southern Louisiana. In general, the neural networks at or near the boundary between land and ocean are well trained and model predictions are of similar accuracy to the basis modeling suites. Networks based on modeling results from complex inland locations are relatively poorly trained. © 2014, US Government.","Artificial neural network; High-fidelity model; Storm surge; Time-dependent surrogate model","Bajo, M., Umgiesser, G., Storm surge forecast through a combination of dynamic and neural network models (2010) Ocean Model, 33, pp. 1-9; Blain, C.A., Westerink, J.J., Luettich, R.A., The influence of domain size on the response characteristics of a hurricane storm surge model (1994) J Geophys Res, 99 (C9), pp. 18467-18479; Cardone VJ (1999) Personal communicationCharhate, S.B., Deo, M.C., Storm surge prediction using neural network and genetic algorithm.

The collaboration discussed here is technically a geovisualization—an immersive, digital “fulldome” film of Hurricane Katrina developed by the Advanced Visualization Laboratory (AVL) at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, produced in collaboration with atmospheric scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. The project, which brought together AVL's programmers, visualization experts, and artists with NCAR's scientists, required the integration of diverse disciplinary perspectives. In the language of such collaborations, the term renaissance team was coined to capture the collective expertise necessary to produce modern, high-end visualizations of large data sets. In this article, we deploy Simondon's concepts of technical objects and collective individuation to analyze the development of AVL's Katrina simulation. One extended sequence of team member collaboration suggests that technical objects also be treated as “collaborators,” for they have the capacity to transform such collectives through the unique problems they present. © 2015 by Association of American Geographers.","Advanced Visualization Laboratory; geovisualization; Gilbert Simondon; renaissance teams; science studies","Ash, J., Architectures of affect: Anticipating and manipulating the event in processes of videogame design and testing (2010) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 28 (4), pp. 653-671; Attention, videogames and the retentional economies of affective amplification (2012) Theory, Culture & Society, 29 (6), pp. 3-26; Bailey, K., Grossardt, T., Toward structured public involvement: Justice, geography and collaborative geospatial/geovisual decision support systems (2010) Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 100 (1), pp. 57-86; Barthélémy, J.-H., Du mort qui saisit le vif”: Simondonian ontology today, trans (2009) J.

It makes use of Bednarek and Caple’s discursive approach to the analysis of news values, and is both exploratory and evaluative in nature. One aim is to test and evaluate the integration of corpus techniques in applying discursive news values analysis (DNVA). We employ and evaluate corpus techniques that have not been tested previously in relation to the large-scale analysis of news values. These techniques include tagged lemma frequencies, collocation, key part-of-speech tags (POStags) and key semantic tags. A secondary aim is to gain insights into how a specific happening – Hurricane Katrina – was linguistically constructed as newsworthy in major American news media outlets, thus also making a contribution to ecolinguistics. © The Author(s) 2015.","corpus linguistics; news discourse; News values; newsworthiness; tagging","http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/usas/usasguide.pdf, ArcherDWilsonARaysonP (2002) Introduction to the USAS category system.

While remote sensing of aboveground canopy properties is relatively advanced, estimating the spatial distribution of root cohesion at the forest landscape scale remains challenging. We utilize canopy height information estimated using lidar (light detecting and ranging) technology as a tool to produce a spatially distributed root cohesion model for landslide hazard prediction. We characterize spatial patterns of total belowground biomass based on the empirically derived allometric relationship developed from soil pit measurements in the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, North Carolina. The vertical distribution of roots and tensile strength were sampled at soil pits allowing us to directly relate canopy height to root cohesion and use this model within a distributed ecohydrological modeling framework, providing transient estimates of runoff, subsurface flow, soil moisture, and pore pressures. We tested our model in mountainous southern Appalachian catchments that experienced a number of landslides during the 2004 hurricane season. Slope stability estimates under the assumption of spatially uniform root cohesion significantly underpredicted both the total number of landslides and the number of ""false positives,"" unfailed areas of the landscape that were predicted to fail. When we incorporate spatially distributed root cohesion, the accuracy of the slope stability forecast improves dramatically. With the growing availability of lidar data that can be used to infer belowground information, these methods may provide a wider utility for improving landslide hazard prediction and forecasting. © 2015.

While remote sensing of aboveground canopy properties is relatively advanced, estimating the spatial distribution of root cohesion at the forest landscape scale remains challenging. We utilize canopy height information estimated using lidar (light detecting and ranging) technology as a tool to produce a spatially distributed root cohesion model for landslide hazard prediction. We characterize spatial patterns of total belowground biomass based on the empirically derived allometric relationship developed from soil pit measurements in the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, North Carolina. The vertical distribution of roots and tensile strength were sampled at soil pits allowing us to directly relate canopy height to root cohesion and use this model within a distributed ecohydrological modeling framework, providing transient estimates of runoff, subsurface flow, soil moisture, and pore pressures. We tested our model in mountainous southern Appalachian catchments that experienced a number of landslides during the 2004 hurricane season. Slope stability estimates under the assumption of spatially uniform root cohesion significantly underpredicted both the total number of landslides and the number of ""false positives,"" unfailed areas of the landscape that were predicted to fail. When we incorporate spatially distributed root cohesion, the accuracy of the slope stability forecast improves dramatically. With the growing availability of lidar data that can be used to infer belowground information, these methods may provide a wider utility for improving landslide hazard prediction and forecasting. ©2015.
