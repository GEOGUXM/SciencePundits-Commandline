The sample consisted of 6–12-year-old boys diagnosed with ADHD (n = 149), boys in the control group (n = 47) and both parents (n = 392). Amongst the many exclusion criteria was the comorbidity of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Parental self-reports of current ADHD symptoms were obtained using the Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Scale (ADD/ADHD Scale), and past symptoms were retrospectively obtained using the Wender-Utah Rating Scale (WUR Scale). For children diagnosed with ADHD, the frequency of parents with ADHD symptoms was higher than the parents without ADHD symptoms; the significance was derived from the group in which both parents displayed ADHD symptoms. The ADHD symptom scores of the parents led to a high accuracy level when predicting ADHD in children (sensitivity) but led to a low accuracy level when classifying children without any diagnosis in the control group (specificity). The study disclosed the psychometric strengths and weaknesses of the ADD/ADHD and WUR scales for measuring parental ADHD symptoms and provided original findings on their psychometric properties. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Adult Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD/ADHD) Scale; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Parental ADHD symptoms; Sensitivity and specificity; Wender Utah (WUR) Scale",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925398232

We conducted a retrospective study by screening medical records of all consecutive patients with BCECTSs, spike-wave index (SWI) >. 30%, and ADHD/ADD that were evaluated in our pediatric epilepsy service and were followed up for at least two years. Patients with neurocognitive deterioration detected by formal testing were excluded. A total of 17 patients with mean age of 6.9. years at BCECTS diagnosis were identified. The patients' mean SWI was 60% and that dense electrical activity lasted 1.5. years on average (range: 1-4.5. years). Six children were formally diagnosed with learning disabilities in addition to ADD/ADHD. All of them were treated with an average of three antiepileptic medications, mainly for the purpose of normalizing the EEG, but none of them was treated with steroids or high-dose diazepam. The mean duration of follow-up was 5.5. years. A cognitive or behavioral deterioration was not detected in any of them. Our data suggest that when treating a child with BCECTSs, high SWI, and school difficulties, the most critical parameter that determines the necessity of using second-line antiepileptic agents such as steroids or high-dose diazepam is a formal psychological evaluation that proves cognitive (I.Q.) decline. Otherwise, these agents may be avoided. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Academic decline; BCECTS; ESES; Treatment","Fejerman, N., Caraballo, R.H., Dalla Bernardina, B., Atypical evolutions of benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (2007) Benign focal epilepsies in infancy, childhood and adolescents, p. 179. , John Libbey, Eurotext Ltd., London, England, N.

Autism, seizures, schizophrenia and mild dysmorphic features are less commonly seen. The 15q11.2 BP1–BP2 microdeletion involving four genes (i.e., TUBGCP5, CYFIP1, NIPA1, NIPA2) is emerging as a recognized syndrome with a prevalence ranging from 0.57%–1.27% of patients presenting for microarray analysis which is a two to four fold increase compared with controls. Review of clinical features from about 200 individuals were grouped into five categories and included developmental (73%) and speech (67%) delays; dysmorphic ears (46%) and palatal anomalies (46%); writing (60%) and reading (57%) difficulties, memory problems (60%) and verbal IQ scores ≤75 (50%); general behavioral problems, unspecified (55%) and abnormal brain imaging (43%). Other clinical features noted but not considered as common were seizures/epilepsy (26%), autism spectrum disorder (27%), attention deficit disorder (ADD)/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (35%), schizophrenia/paranoid psychosis (20%) and motor delay (42%). Not all individuals with the deletion are clinically affected, yet the collection of findings appear to share biological pathways and presumed genetic mechanisms. Neuropsychiatric and behavior disturbances and mild dysmorphic features are associated with genomic imbalances of the 15q11.2 BP1–BP2 region, including microdeletions, but with an apparent incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","15q11.2 BP1–BP2 microdeletion; Autism; Burnside-Butler syndrome; Chromosome breakpoints BP1 and BP2; Clinical and behavioral phenotype; Language and motor delays; Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes; Review","Locke, D.P., Segraves, R., Nicholls, R.D., Schwartz, S., Pinkel, D., Alberston, D.G., Eichler, E.E., BAC microarray analysis of 15q-q13 rearrangements and the impact of segmental duplications (2004) J.

Method: Adults with NF1 without (n = 26) and with ADHD (n = 22), and adults with ADHD only (n = 27) completed questionnaires on personality traits and life satisfaction. Differences between groups were analyzed. Results: Participants with NF1 and ADHD present an emotionally instable psychological phenotype similar to adults with ADHD only, which differed significantly from that in adults with NF1 only. Participants with NF1 and ADHD had significantly lower overall life satisfaction than NF1 participants without such symptoms, affecting general health, self-satisfaction, sexuality, and family. Conclusion: The authors’ findings show that ADHD symptoms can persist through adulthood. These NF1 patients display problems similar to those of adults with ADHD only. This finding is highly relevant to understand the behavioral and psychological phenotype in adults with NF1 and to offer psychological and/or medical treatment. © 2012 SAGE Publications.","ADD/ADHD; adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; emotional problems; life satisfaction; neurofibromatosis type 1","(1998) Diagnostische Kriterien des Diagnostischen und Statistischen Manuals Psychischer Störungen DSM-IV, , Göttingen, Germany: ; :, Hogrefe; Barton, B., North, K., Social skills of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (2004) Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology, 46, pp. 553-563; Brewer, V.R., Moore, B.D., Hiscock, M., Learning disability subtypes in children with neurofibromatosis (1997) Journal of Learning Disabilities, 30, pp. 521-533; Brown, T.E., (1996) Attention-deficit disorder scales: Manual, , San Antonio, TX: ; :, The Psychological Corporation; Chao, C.-Y., Gau, S.S.F., Mao, W.-C., Shyu, J.-F., Chen, Y.-C., Yeh, C.-B., Relationship of attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder symptoms, depressive/anxiety symptoms, and life quality in young men (2008) Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, 62, pp. 421-426; Cohen, J., (1988) Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences, , New York, NY: ; :, Erlbaum; Dilts, C.V., Carey, J.C., Kircher, J.C., Hoffman, R.O., Creel, D., Ward, K., ..

However, the problems faced by adults with ADHD in their daily lives remain largely unexplored. Objective: To assess the perspectives, problems and needs of adults with ADHD. Design and Participants: In this exploratory qualitative study, adults (n = 52) with a primary ADHD or ADD diagnosis, aged 21 years or older, participated in eight focus groups in five cities in the Netherlands. Results: Although core symptoms of ADHD were perceived as a problem, participants placed greater emphasis on social problems that arise from living with ADHD and their subsequent effects on self-image. Accompanying problems were feelings of powerlessness, lack of acceptance by their social environment and poor self-image. Adults with ADHD would like to see greater acceptance of ADHD and its accompanying problems, together with appreciation for personal competences and strengths in certain domains, such as creative or associative thinking. Conclusion: Our study adds to previous research by providing insight into how these problems are interrelated and their strong link to the social environment. Perceived powerlessness, failure and negative reactions of the social environment lead to a persistent low self-image. This merits substantial attention in future research, particularly when considering on-going care options. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Adult ADHD; Adults; Attention deficit disorder; Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder; Focus groups; Qualitative research",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922981714

Youth with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD) have higher rates of screen time, but associations with bedroom TVs are unknown in this population. We examined the association of having a bedroom TV with screen time among youth with ADD/ADHD. Methods: Data were from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health. Youth 6-17. years whose parent/guardian reported a physician's diagnosis of ADD/ADHD (n. =. 7024) were included in the analysis. Parents/guardians reported the presence of a bedroom TV and average weekday TV screen time. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models assessed the effects of a bedroom on screen time. Results: Youth with ADD/ADHD engaged in screen time with an average of 149.1. min/weekday and 59% had a TV in their bedroom. Adjusting for child and family characteristics, having a TV in the bedroom was associated with 25. minute higher daily screen time (95% CI: 12.8-37.4. min/day). A bedroom TV was associated with 32% higher odds of engaging in screen time for over 2. h/day (OR. =. 1.3; 95% CI: 1.0-1.7). Conclusion: Future research should explore whether removing TVs from bedrooms reduces screen time among youth with ADD/ADHD. © 2014 .","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Screen time; Television","Media and children [online], , http://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/pages/media-and-children.aspx, Available:, (Accessed 2012); Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: a meta-analytic review of the scientific literature (2001) Psychol.

The articles in the current special series expand upon this existing work by demonstrating how treatment can (a) be extended to adolescent and college student groups, (b) incorporate a romantic couples approach, (c) productively add mindfulness as an active therapy component, and (d) engage clients in identifying and adaptively weighing overly optimistic thoughts that may be all too common for those with ADHD.

What is less clear is the mechanism(s) whereby ADHD gives rise to increased engagement in addictive behaviors, and whether there are sex differences in the ADHD-addiction propensity. Both ADHD and addictions have also been associated with personality traits such as impulsivity, reward seeking, anxiousness, and negative affect. In this study, we tested a moderator-mediation model which predicted that both sex and ADHD-symptom status would make independent contributions to the variance in personality risk and in addictive behaviors, with males, and those with diagnosed ADHD, scoring higher on both dependent variables. Our model also predicted that the effect of sex and ADHD-symptom status on addictive behaviors would be via the mediating or intervening influence of personality risk factors. Methods: A community-based sample of young men and women took part in the study. Among these individuals, 46 had received a life-time diagnosis of ADHD. The non-diagnosed participants were dichotomized into a high-ADHD symptom group (n=83) and a low-symptom group (n=84). Results: We found that a high-risk personality profile may, in part, account for the relationship between ADHD symptomatology and the use/abuse of a broad range of addictive behaviors. However, we found no sex differences in personality risk for addiction or in the use of addictive behaviors; nor did sex moderate the relationships we assessed. Conclusions: While ADHD Status showed a strong relationship with both dependent variables in the model, we found no difference between those who had been diagnosed with ADHD and treated with stimulants, and their high-symptom non-diagnosed/non-treated counterparts. These results add support to claims that the treatment of ADHD with stimulant medication neither protects nor fosters the risk for substance abuse disorders. © 2015 Davis, Cohen, Davids and Rabindranath.","Addictive behaviors; ADHD; Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder; Personality; Sex","Nikolas, M.A., Burt, S.A., Genetic and environmental influences on ADHD symptom dimensions of inattention and hyperactivity: a meta-analysis (2010) J Abnorm Psychol, 119, pp. 1-17; Biederman, J., Petty, C.R., Clarke, A., Lomedico, A., Faraone, S.V., Predictors of persistent ADHD: an 11-year follow-up study (2011) J Psychiatr Res, 45, pp. 150-155; Boomsma, D.I., Saviouk, V., Hottenga, J.J., Distel, M.A., de Moor, M.H., Vink, J.M., Genetic epidemiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD index) in adults (2010) PLoS One, 5; van den Brink, W., Willemsen, G., de Geus, E.J., Boomsma, D.I., Genetic etiology of stability of attention problems in young adulthood (2006) Am J Med Genet Part N Neuropsychiatr Genet, 141 B, pp. 55-60; Wilens, T.E., The nature of the relationship between attention-deficity/hyperactivity disorder and substance abuse (2007) J Clin Psychiatr, 68, pp. 4-8; Wilens, T.E., Adamson, J., Sgambati, S., Whitely, J., Santry, A., Monuteaux, M.C., Do individuals with ADHD self-medicate with with cigarettes and substances of abuse?

Racial and gender differences in the relationship of ADHD symptoms and smoking trajectories were also assessed. Methods: A subsample of 9719 youth (54.5% female) was drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Cohort sequential design and zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) latent growth modeling were used to estimate the relationship between ADHD directionality and severity on smoking development. Results: ADHD severity's effect on the likelihood of ever smoking cigarettes at the intercept (age 13) had a greater impact on White males than other groups. ADHD severity also had a stronger influence on the initial number of cigarettes smoked at age 13 among Hispanic participants. The relationships between ADHD directionality (hyperactive-impulsive symptoms relative to inattentive symptoms) and a higher number of cigarettes smoked at the intercept were stronger among Hispanic males than others. Gender differences manifested only among Whites. Conclusion: ADHD severity and directionality had unique effects on smoking trajectories. Our results also highlight that the risk of ADHD symptoms may differ by race and gender. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","ADHD symptoms; Racial and gender differences; Smoking trajectories","Aytaclar, S., Tarter, R.E., Kirisci, L., Lu, S., Association between hyperactivity and executive cognitive function in childhood and substance use in early adolescence (1999) J.

Study design: We used data from the 1997-2011 National Health Interview Survey to study long-term outcomes in children aged 0-17 years with CHD. Parents were asked whether their child was diagnosed with CHD. We assessed for comorbidities, including autism/autism spectrum disorders; healthcare utilization, including number of emergency room visits; and daily life aspects, including number of days of school missed. These outcomes were compared between children with and without reported CHD using ORs and c2 statistics. Results: The study included 420 children with reported CHD and 180 048 children without CHD, with no significant between-group differences in age and sex. The odds of reporting worse health and more than 10 days of school/daycare missed in the previous year were 3 times higher for the children with CHD compared with those without CHD. Children aged 2-17 with CHD were more likely than those without CHD to have had a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (crude OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.9-11.0) or intellectual disability (crude OR, 9.1; 95% CI, 5.4-15.4). The rates of emergency room, home, and doctors' office visits were significantly higher in the children with CHD. Conclusion: Reported adverse outcomes were more prevalent in the children with CHD. Our findings, particularly those regarding neurodevelopmental outcomes, may be helpful for parents, healthcare providers, and others in assessing the specific needs of children and teenagers with CHD.

Little is known about which variables predict successful completion. The present study examined demographics; behavioral histories; current behaviors; and family, school, and social issues among participants drawn from a metropolitan Detroit diversion program. Logistic regression analyses identified variables predictive of program completion. Key predictors included race, aggressive behavior, previous counseling or treatment, poor academic performance, diagnosed with ADD/ADHD, and parental reports of not contributing to household chores.

Low-frequency RT fluctuations, which have been associated with intrinsic brain rhythms occurring approximately every 15-40. s, have been shown to add unique information for ADHD. In this study, we investigated whether these fluctuations also relate to attentional problems in the general population, and contribute to the two major domains of psychopathology: externalizing and internalizing problems. Methods: RT was monitored throughout a self-paced sustained attention task (duration: 9.1. ±. 1.2. min) in a Dutch population cohort of young adults ( n= 1455, mean age: 19.0. ±. 0.6. years, 55.1% girls). To characterize temporal fluctuations in RT, we performed direct Fourier Transform on externally validated frequency bands based on frequency ranges of neuronal oscillations: Slow-5 (0.010-0.027. Hz), Slow-4 (0.027-0.073. Hz), and three additional higher frequency bands. Relative magnitude of Slow-4 fluctuations was the primary predictor in regression models for attentional, internalizing and externalizing problems (measured by the Adult Self-Report questionnaire). Additionally, stepwise regression models were created to investigate (a) whether Slow-4 significantly improved the prediction of problem behaviors beyond the RT-SD and (b) whether the other frequency bands provided important additional information. Results: The magnitude of Slow-4 fluctuations significantly predicted attentional and externalizing problems and even improved model fit after modeling RT-SD first (R2 change=0.6%, P&lt;.01). Subsequently, adding Slow-5 explained additional variance for externalizing problems (R2 change=0.4%, P&lt;.05). For internalizing problems, only RT-SD made a significant contribution to the regression model (R2=0.5%, P&lt;.01), that is, none of the frequency bands provided additional information. Conclusions: Low-frequency RT fluctuations have added predictive value for attentional and externalizing, but not internalizing problems beyond global differences in variability.

They are widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries to increase the appeal and acceptability of their products. Synthetic food colorants can achieve hues not possible for natural colorants and are cheaper, more easily available, and last longer. However, since the use of artificial food coloring has become widespread, many allergic and other immune reactive disorders have increasingly been reported. During the past 50 y, the amount of synthetic dye used in foods has increased by 500%. Simultaneously, an alarming rise has occurred in behavioral problems in children, such as aggression, attention deficit disorder (ADD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The ingestion of food delivers the greatest foreign antigenic load that challenges the immune system. Artificial colors can also be absorbed via the skin through cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. The molecules of synthetic colorants are small, and the immune system finds it difficult to defend the body against them. They can also bond to food or body proteins and, thus, are able to act in stealth mode to circumvent and disrupt the immune system. The consumption of synthetic food colors, and their ability to bind with body proteins, can have significant immunological consequences. This consumption can activate the inflammatory cascade, can result in the induction of intestinal permeability to large antigenic molecules, and could lead to cross-reactivities, autoimmunities, and even neurobehavioral disorders. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recently found a 41% increase in diagnoses of ADHD in boys of high-school age during the past decade. More shocking is the legal amount of artificial colorants allowed by the FDA in the foods, drugs, and cosmetics that we consume and use every day. The consuming public is largely unaware of the perilous truth behind the deceptive allure of artificial color.",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928059369

Abnormal level of dopamine in the central nervous system causes several neurological diseases, e.g., schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and attention deficit hybperactivity disorder (ADHD)/attention deficit disorder (ADD). In this report, we suggest the fabrication of nonenzyme field effect transistor (FET) sensor composed of immobilized Pt particle decorated conducting-polymer (3-carboxylate polypyrrole) nanoparticles (Pt_CPPy) to detect dopamine. The hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) are produced by means of facile chemical reduction of pristine CPPyNP-contained Pt precursor (PtCl4) solution. The Pt_CPPys are then immobilized on an amine-functionalized (-NH2) interdigitated-array electrode substrate, through the formation of covalent bonds with amine groups (-CONH). The resulting Pt_CPPy-based FET sensors exhibit high sensitivity and selectivity toward DA at unprecedentedly low concentrations (100 × 10-15m) and among interfering biomolecules, respectively. Additionally, due to the covalent bonding involved in the immobilization process, a longer lifetime is expected for the FET sensor. A Pt particle-decorated, 3-carboxylate polypyrrole nanoparticle-based nonenzymatic FET sensor is fabricated for highly sensitive and selective dopamine detection with a long lifetime. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The Aggression Questionnaire and the Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scales were administered to two samples: a “low-risk sample” comprising university students (n = 60), and a “high-risk sample” of prison inmates (n = 117). The prevalence of “probable ADD” was found to be higher in the prison sample (33%), compared with the university sample (20%). There were moderate correlations >r = .5 (p < .01) between total ADHD and Aggression Questionnaire scores in both groups. There were also moderate to strong correlations between subscales of both measures, including cognitive processes such as attention and memory and various forms of aggression, which were particularly apparent in the prison sample.

There is, however, increased evidence that several temporal lobe regions could play an important role in ADHD. The present study used MRI-based measurements of cortical thickness to examine possible differences in both prefrontal and temporal lobe regions between medication-näive patients with ADHD (N=50) and age- and sex-matched typically developing controls (N=50). Subjects with ADHD exhibited significantly decreased cortical thickness in the right temporal pole and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) relative to healthy comparison subjects. These differences remained significant after controlling for confounding effects of age, overall mean cortical thickness and comorbid externalizing conditions, such as oppositional defiant and conduct disorders. These results point to the involvement of the temporal pole and OFC in the neuropathology of ADHD. Moreover, present findings add evidence to the assumption that multiple brain regions and psychological processes are associated with ADHD. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Children with CP are at increased risk of attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity (Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)) including working memory deficits. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate if cognitive training may improve working memory in children with CP.Methods/Designs: The study is an investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial with a stepped-wedge design that will include 115 schoolchildren with CP. Eligible for participation are children with CP, aged 7 to 15 years, who are able to follow instructions and handle a computer mouse. Exclusion criteria are the presence of photosensitive epilepsy, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level V (most severe CP) (Phys Ther 80: 974-985, 2000) and severe visual or hearing impairments. Following assessment of eligibility and baseline cognitive assessment the participants will be randomized to either cognitive working memory training or treatment-as-usual ('control group'). The intervention is a computer-based working memory training program consisting of 25 daily sessions to be performed over a 5 to 6-week period at home. A neuropsychological assessment will be performed before and 4 to 6 weeks after completed training. When the latter assessment has been completed in the intervention group, the 'control group' will start on the same training program. Both groups will meet for a final neuropsychological assessment six months after completed training by an examiner unaware of group adherence.Discussion: There is limited evidence for the effect of most interventions in children with CP, and evidence is completely lacking for interventions aiming to improve deficits in cognition, learning and behaviour. The proposed multicenter study, will bring forth comprehensive information about cognitive, neuropsychological, and daily-life functioning in children with CP aged between 7 and 15 years. In addition, the study will be the first to evaluate the effects of an intervention method to improve working memory in children with CP. If successful, computer-based working memory training may represent an efficient and cost-effective intervention for this group of children.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02119364. © 2014 Løhaugen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Cerebral Palsy (CP); Cognitive intervention; Working memory training","Palisano, R.J., Hanna, S.E., Rosenbaum, P.L., Russell, D.J., Walter, S.D., Wood, E.P., Validation of a model of gross motor function for children with cerebral palsy (2000) Phys Ther, 80 (10), pp. 974-985; Surveillance of cerebral palsy in Europe: a collaboration of cerebral palsy surveys and registers.

Drawing on an ongoing fieldwork in a support group for adults diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), this paper highlights three specific functions that psychiatric diagnoses can have as semiotic mediators in the lives of the diagnosed: (1) an explanatory function in relation to experienced problems (even if a diagnosis is a description of symptoms, it is often used to explain these very symptoms), (2) a self-affirming function (in the sense that a diagnosis provides a framework according to which numerous phenomena appear as ""symptoms""), and (3) a disclaiming function in relation to responsibility (with the possibility of medicalizing aspects of moral life). The legitimacy of each can be discussed, which in itself might add to the distress experienced by adults categorized by a contested diagnosis such as ADHD. © 2014 The Editors of Nordic Psychology.","ADHD; cultural psychology; entification; qualitative inquiry; semiotic mediation","Kommune, A., ADHD-strategi for voksne i social og beskæftigelsesforvaltningen [adhd strategy for adults in the office for social affairs and work] (2013) Aarhus: The Municipality of Aarhus.; Adler, L.A., Shaw, D., Diagnosing adhd in adults (2011) ADHD in Adults: Characterization, Diagnosis, and Treatment, pp. 91-105. , J.

A recent population-based study reports that suicide in acne is related to the psychosocial burden of substantial acne, rather than medication effects. As suicidality is not always directly related to acne severity, factors other than acne's direct psychosocial burden also likely contribute to the suicide risk. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a disorder of childhood and adolescence that is associated with increased suicidality. We examined the frequency of ADHD in acne versus all other dermatology-related patient visits, after controlling for age and other factors. Methods: Retrospective cross-sectional study of epidemiologic databases (NAMCS and NHAMCS) representing 55 825 dermatology outpatient visits from 1995 to 2009. Results: In comparison to other dermatologic disorders, acne was over two times more likely to be associated with ADHD (odds ratio = 2.34, 95%CI 1.06-5.14) after controlling for the possible confounding effects of age, sex, stimulant medications, comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders, and atopic dermatitis, a condition previously associated with ADHD. Discussion: Our preliminary findings suggest a significant association of acne with ADHD, which could contribute to the increased psychological morbidity and suicidality in some acne patients. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA on behalf of Informa UK Ltd.","ADD; Attention deficit disorder; Dermatology; Emotional regulation; Self-injury; Skin; Suicide","Langan, S.M., Batchelor, J.M., Acne, isotretinoin and suicide attempts: A critical appraisal (2011) Br J Dermatol., 164, pp. 1183-1185; Halvorsen, J.A., Stern, R.S., Dalgard, F., Thoresen, M., Bjertness, E., Lien, L., Suicidal ideation, mental health problems, and social impairment are increased in adolescents with acne: A population-based study (2011) J Invest Dermatol., 131, pp. 363-370; Gupta, M.A., Gupta, A.K., Depression and suicidal ideation in dermatology patients with acne, alopecia areata, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (1998) Br J Dermatol., 139, pp. 846-850; (2000) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , American Psychiatric Association. 4th ed.

Methods: We performed a thematic analysis of comments written by primary school teachers who participated in a case-vignette study investigating the ability of teachers to recognise ADHD. Teachers read one of four types of vignette describing the behaviour of a nine-year-old child who met diagnostic criteria for ADHD (either a boy or a girl with inattentive or combined subtype of ADHD). They answered questions (identical for all types of vignette) about their views regarding the problems and their management. Teachers were invited to add their own comments. Results: Altogether 496 teachers from 110 schools completed the questionnaire: 250 (50%) teachers from 94 schools wrote at least one comment, adding up to 341 comments. Regarding their views on the need to refer the child to specialist services, 32 teachers made comments that reflected caution. The most frequent comments were that it was too early to say whether a referral was necessary, the problems were not severe enough or the main support would come from school. Teachers also reported a lack of knowledge about specialist services or criticised them. When asked whether medication might be beneficial for the child, 125 teachers expressed hesitant or negative views: that it was premature to express an opinion about medication or too soon to give medication to the child; that medication was not necessary or should not be used at all; or that the problems were not severe enough or were emotional in nature. Only five teachers reported having a positive experience of the effect of medication. Conclusion: Teachers' comments suggested a strong preference in using within-school strategies for the management of children with ADHD. Teachers were reluctant to endorse medication for DHD and expressed negative views about its use.

The obvious reason is due to the overall involvement of the individual and the persistence of the disorder throughout his or her life. Here I seek to detect its relationship with violence. Google Scholar was used as a search engine on the topic and an extensive literature review was performed on journals over the last four years, national and international thesis and books focusing on the issue of violence. Genetics, social and emotional repercussions, and prevalence of the disorder was established on those suffering with ADD and ADHD. The disorder affects them generally and throughout their life, and there is growing evidence of the close relationship between ADHD and violence-aggression. It is a worldwide prevalent disorder, a public health problem that involves all levels of society, the judicial system, educational institutions and health organizations. In accordance, attention to this segment of the population must be multidisciplinary and because of its prevalence, it is a costly disorder.","Aggression; Attention deficit; Hyperactivity; Impulsiveness; Violence","Burgu, B., Aydogdu, O., Gurkan, K., Lower urinary tract conditions in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Correlation of symptoms based on validated scoring systems (2011) J Urol, 185, pp. 663-668; Goraya, J.S., Cruz, M., Valencia, I., Sleep study abnormalities in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (2009) Pediatr Neurol, 40, pp. 42-46; Hidas, A., Noy, A.F., Birman, N., Oral health status, salivary flow rate and salivary quality in children, adolescents and young adults with ADHD (2011) Arch Oral Biol, 56, pp. 1137-1141; Lee, B., Viljoen, M., Stimulants and growth in children with attentiondeficit/ hyperactivity disorder (2011) Medical Hypotheses, 77, pp. 21-28; Limbers, C.A., Ripperger-Suhler, J., Boutton, K., A comparative analysis of health-related quality of life and family impact between children with ADHD treated in a general pediatric clinic and a psychiatric clinic utilizing the PedsQL (2011) J Atten Disord, 15, pp. 392-402; Ma, L., Chen, Y.H., Chen, H., The function of hypothalamus-pituitary- adrenal axis in children with ADHD (2011) Brain Res, 1368, pp. 159-162; Mick, E., Mcgough, J.J., Middleton, F.A., Genome-wide association study of blood pressure response to methylphenidate treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (2011) Prog NeuroPsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry, 35, pp. 466-472; Owens, J.A., Rosen, C.L., Mindell, J.A., Kirchner, H.L., Use of pharmacotherapy for insomnia in child psychiatry practice: A national survey (2010) Sleep Med, 11, pp. 692-700; Siegenthaler, R., Intervención multicontextual y multicomponente en niños con trastorno por déficit de atención con hiperactividad subtipo combinado (2009), Tesis doctoral.

Slowing of reaction times (RTs) for correct responses following errors made during decision tasks has been interpreted as an indication of intact self-regulatory functioning and has been shown to be attenuated in school-aged children with ADHD. This study attempted to examine whether ADHD symptoms are associated with an early-emerging deficit in posterror slowing. Method: A computerized two-choice RT task was administered to an ethnically diverse sample of preschool-aged children classified as either ""control"" (n = 120) or ""hyperactive/inattentive"" (HI; n = 148) using parent-and teacher-rated ADHD symptoms. Analyses were conducted to determine whether HI preschoolers exhibit a deficit in this self-regulatory ability. Results: HI children exhibited reduced posterror slowing relative to controls on the trials selected for analysis. Supplementary analyses indicated that this may have been due to a reduced proportion of trials following errors on which HI children slowed rather than due to a reduction in the absolute magnitude of slowing on all trials following errors. Conclusions: High levels of ADHD symptoms in preschoolers may be associated with a deficit in error processing as indicated by posterror slowing. The results of supplementary analyses suggest that this deficit is perhaps more a result of failures to perceive errors than of difficulties with executive control. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","ADD/ADHD; Cognition; Posterror slowing.; Preschool Children; Reaction time","(1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association.

Psychologists in southeastern Virginia formed a regional school health coalition to implement and evaluate interventions to address the problem. Other professionals with strong ties to the pharmaceutical industry launched ad hominem attacks on the coalition's research and work. These attacks contributed to the work being terminated in 2005. In the ensuing years, ADHD drug treatment continued to escalate. Today, the national rate of ADHD diagnosis exceeds all reasonable estimates of the disorder's true prevalence, with 14 % of American children being diagnosed before reaching young adulthood. Notable key opinion leaders continue to claim that there is no cause for concern, but with a message shift from ""the prevalence is not too high"" to ""high prevalence is not too concerning."" This paper provides an object lesson about how innovative research can be derailed to the detriment of sound medical and mental health care of children when industry interests are threatened. Tenure may be the only option for protecting innovative research from specious attacks. The authors offer a summary of the data on ADHD drug treatments, suggest judicious use of such treatments, and add their voices to others who are once again sounding a cautionary alarm. © 2013 The Author(s).","Academic freedom; ADHD; Behavioral intervention; Child development; Conflict of interest; Key opinion leader; Overdiagnosis; Prescription drug abuse; Public health psychology","Antonuccio, D., Treating depressed children with antidepressants: More harm than benefit?

This study examined whether childhood physical abuse was associated with ADD/ADHD. Data were derived from a population-based sample of 13,054 adults from the 2005 Canadian Community Health Survey. We used logistical regression analysis in 2 models, both of which had ADD/ADHD as the criterion variable. There were 7 times higher odds of ADD/ADHD among those who reported they had been abused after controlling for several potential mediating factors, including age, race, gender, and 3 other types of adverse childhood experiences (parental divorce, parental addictions, and long-term parental unemployment) in comparison to those who were not abused. The results of this analysis show a strong link between childhood abuse and ADD/ADHD, an association that requires further study.

Method We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and PsycINFO until May 2013 for randomized trials comparing α-2 agonists with placebo in ADHD youth. Primary outcome was reduction in overall ADHD symptoms. Secondary outcomes included hyperactivity/impulsivity, inattentiveness, oppositional defiant disorder symptoms (ODD symptoms), all-cause discontinuation, specific-cause discontinuation, and adverse effects. Standardized mean differences (SMD), relative risk (RR), and number-needed-to-treat/number-needed-to-harm (NNT/NNH) were calculated. Data were analyzed separately in monotherapy and as add-on to psychostimulants. Results Altogether, 12 studies (N = 2,276) were included. Across 9 studies (n = 1,550), α-2 agonist monotherapy significantly reduced overall ADHD symptoms (SMD = -0.59, p <.00001), hyperactivity/ impulsivity (SMD = -0.56, p <.00001), inattention (SMD = -0.57, p <.00001), and ODD symptoms (SMD = -0.44, p =.0004). Similarly, α-2 agonist add-on treatment (3 studies, n = 726) significantly reduced overall ADHD symptoms (SMD = -0.36, p <.0001), hyperactivity/impulsivity (SMD = -0.33, p <.0001), and inattention (SMD = -0.34, p <.0001), but effect sizes were lower than in monotherapy trials (p =.03-0.04). As monotherapy, α-2 agonists had lower all-cause (RR = 0.70, p =.01, NNT = 10) and inefficacy-related (RR = 0.39, p <.0001) discontinuations than did placebo; however, intolerability-related discontinuation was similar, despite significantly more common fatigue (NNH = 10), sedation (NNH = 17), and somnolence (NNH = 4) and significantly greater hypotensive (clonidine-IR), bradycardic (clonidine-IR), and QTc prolonging (guanfacine-XR) effects. Added to stimulants, α-2 agonists had all-cause and specific-cause discontinuations that were comparable to those of placebo, but somnolence (NNH = 10) was more common, and hypotensive and bradycardic effects (clonidine-XR and guanfacine-XR) were greater than with placebo. Conclusions α-2 Agonist monotherapy and, possibly to a lesser extent, co-treatment, are significantly superior to placebo for overall, hyperactivity, and inattentive ADHD symptoms. Efficacy advantages need to be balanced against fatigue, somnolence/sedation, hypotension, bradycardia, and possibly QTc prolongation. © 2014 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.","α-2 agonists; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); clonidine; guanfacine; oppositionality","Kessler, R.C., Avenevoli, S., Costello, J., Severity of 12-month DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement (2012) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 69, pp. 381-389; Costello, E.J., Copeland, W., Angold, A., Trends in psychopathology across the adolescent years: What changes when children become adolescents, and when adolescents become adults?

The prevalence of such neurobehavioral abnormalities as cognitive and mood disorders, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is significantly higher among patients with epilepsy than in the general population. A long-held view that comorbidities of epilepsy represent mere epiphenomena of seizures has undergone substantial transformation during the past decade, as emerging clinical evidence and experimental evidence suggest the involvement of specific neurobiological mechanisms in the evolution of neurobehavioral deficits in patients with epilepsy. Developmental aspects of both epilepsy and its comorbidities, as well as the frequently reported reciprocal connection between these disorders, both add other dimensions to the already complex problem.In light of progress in effective seizure management in many patients with epilepsy, the importance of neurobehavioral comorbidities has become acute, as the latter are frequently more detrimental to patients' quality of life compared with seizures. This calls for a serious increase in efforts to effectively predict, manage, and ideally cure these comorbidities. Coordinated multicenter clinical, translational, and basic research studies focusing on epidemiology, neuropsychology, neurophysiology, imaging, genetics, epigenetics, and pharmacology of neurobehavioral comorbidities of epilepsy are absolutely instrumental for ensuring tangible progress in the field. Clinical research should focus more on new-onset epilepsy and put particular emphasis on longitudinal studies in large cohorts of patients and groups at risk, while translational research should primarily focus on the development of valid preclinical systems which would allow investigating the fundamental mechanism of epilepsy comorbidities.The final goal of the described research efforts would lie in producing an armamentarium of evidence-based diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions which would at minimum mitigate and at maximum prevent or abolish neurobehavioral comorbidities of epilepsy and, thus, improve the quality of life of those patients with epilepsy who suffer from the said comorbidities. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Behavior; Cognition; Comorbidities; Epilepsy; Onset of epilepsy","Engel, J., ILAE classification of epilepsy syndromes (2006) Epilepsy Res, 70 (SUPPL. 1), pp. S5-S10; Berg, A.T., Berkovic, S.F., Brodie, M.J., Buchhalter, J., Cross, J.H., van Emde, B.W., Revised terminology and concepts for organization of seizures and epilepsies: report of the ILAE Commission on Classification and Terminology, 2005-2009 (2010) Epilepsia, 51, pp. 676-685; Elger, C.E., Helmstaedter, C., Kurthen, M., Chronic epilepsy and cognition (2004) Lancet Neurol, 3, pp. 663-672; Swinkels, W.A., Kuyk, J., van Dyck, R., Spinhoven, P., Psychiatric comorbidity in epilepsy (2005) Epilepsy Behav, 7, pp. 37-50; Sillanpaa, M., Jalava, M., Kaleva, O., Shinnar, S., Long-term prognosis of seizures with onset in childhood (1998) N Engl J Med, 338, pp. 1715-1722; Helmstaedter, C., Hermann, B., Lassonde, M., Kahane, P., Arzimanoglou, A., Neuropsychology in the care of people with epilepsy (2011) Progress in epileptic disorders, , John Libbey Eurotext, Montrouge; Luoni, C., Bisulli, F., Canevini, M.P., De Sarro, G., Fattore, C., Galimberti, C.A., Determinants of health-related quality of life in pharmacoresistant epilepsy: results from a large multicenter study of consecutively enrolled patients using validated quantitative assessments (2011) Epilepsia, 52, pp. 2181-2191; Helmstaedter, C., Witt, J.A., Clinical neuropsychology in epilepsy: theoretical and practical issues (2012) Handb Clin Neurol, 107, pp. 437-459; Ettinger, A., Reed, M., Cramer, J., Depression and comorbidity in community-based patients with epilepsy or asthma (2004) Neurology, 63, pp. 1008-1014; Taylor, D., Besag, F., Problematic behavior in children with epilepsy: issues and management (2013) Handb Clin Neurol, 111, pp. 697-706; Rai, D., Kerr, M.P., McManus, S., Jordanova, V., Lewis, G., Brugha, T.S., Epilepsy and psychiatric comorbidity: a nationally representative population-based study (2012) Epilepsia, 53, pp. 1095-1103; Liu, X., Muller, R.U., Huang, L.T., Kubie, J.L., Rotenberg, A., Rivard, B., Seizure-induced changes in place cell physiology: relationship to spatial memory (2003) J Neurosci, 23, pp. 11505-11515; Pineda, E.A., Hensler, J.G., Sankar, R., Shin, D., Burke, T.F., Mazarati, A.M., Plasticity of presynaptic and postsynaptic serotonin 1A receptors in an animal model of epilepsy-associated depression (2011) Neuropsychopharmacology, 36, pp. 1305-1316; Patterson, P.H., Maternal infection and immune involvement in autism (2011) Trends Mol Med, 17, pp. 389-394; Pineda, E., Shin, D., You, S.J., Auvin, S., Sankar, R., Mazarati, A., Maternal immune activation promotes hippocampal kindling epileptogenesis in mice (2013) Ann Neurol, 74 (1), pp. 11-19; Sutula, T., Pitkänen, A., Do seizures damage the brain?

Indeed, the DSM-IV didn't allow concomitant diagnosis. However, there is a clinical, neuropsychological and genetic overlap between these two disorders. Thus, 30-80 % of patients with ASD fill criteria for ADD/ADHD and in 20-50 % of patients with ADD/ADHD are found the diagnostic criteria for ASD. These observations raise the question of the link between ADD/ADHD and ASD: Is ADD/ADHD a minor form of ASD? Are ASD and ADD/ADHD different manifestations from a single neurodevelopmental disorder? Finally, are they two distinct developmental disorders whose clinical expressions would approach? Recent studies seem to distinguish two types of situations: Comorbid patients with less severe symptoms of ASD do not differ qualitatively from ADD/ADHD patients alone, which argues for a continuum between ADD/ADHD and ASD. Patients with ASD symptoms predominate are qualitatively different subjects from ADD/ADHD alone, thus corresponds to the hypothesis of two distinct nosological entities. Anyway, when ADD/ADHD and ASD are associated, there are specific clinical expression of developmental pathways and prognosis. Thus, these comorbid patients suffer more frequently from other psychiatric disorders, have a poorer quality of life, poorer adaptive functioning and clinical expression is more persistent over time. The modalities of treatment of comorbid patients may associate psychoeducational, psychotherapeutic approaches and medication (methylphenidate, atomoxetine, guanfacine, risperidone, aripiprazole). © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Attention-deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADHD); Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD); Care management; Comorbidity; Genetic; Neurodevelopmental disorder; Neurology; Semiology","(2000) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV, , American Psychiatric Publishing, Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association; (2013) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5, , American Psychiatric Publishing, Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association; Bühler, E., Bachmann, C., Goyert, H., Heinzel-Gutenbrunner, M., Kamp-Becker, I., Differential diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder by means of inhibitory control and 'theory of mind' (2011) J Autism Dev Disord, 41, pp. 1718-1726; Demopoulos, C., Hopkins, J., Davis, A., A comparison of social cognitive profiles in children with autism spectrum disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a matter of quantitative but not qualitative difference?

We assessed for comorbid developmental disorders and which cognitive processes were impaired in children with ADHD. Method: Measures of intelligence, language, motor skills, social cognition, and executive functions were administered to children with ADHD (n = 53) and age/sex-matched typical children. Results: Clinically significant deficits were 2 to 7 times as common in children with ADHD as in typical children, and the structure of ability differed in the two groups. Abilities were less differentiated in children with ADHD. Conclusion: The results indicate a need for comprehensive screening for developmental disorders in children with ADHD and imply that research needs to focus on how ADHD and developmental disorders may share an etiology. © 2012 SAGE Publications.","ADD/ADHD; comorbidity; development; motor control; social cognition","Achenbach, T., (1991) Manual for the Child Behavior Checklist: 4-18 and 1991 Profile, , Burlington, VT: University of Vermont, Department of Psychiatry; Alloway, T., Archibald, L., Working memory and learning in children with developmental disorder and specific language impairment (2008) Journal of Learning Disabilities, 41, pp. 251-262; (1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , (4th ed.).

Method: A sample of 149 adults participated in the study. Data were collected from the participant's medical records and from self-report questionnaires. Multiple regression analyses were applied to identify predictors of the SF-36 mental component outcomes. Results: The sample was highly impaired in terms of low health-related quality of life on all SF-36 mental component scales. The ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) inattentiveness was the strongest predictor of vitality and the only significant predictor of role-emotional outcome. The ASRS hyperactivity/impulsivity was the strongest predictor of social function and the only predictor of mental health outcome. Conclusion: Inattentiveness and hyperactivity/impulsivity were differentially related to specific quality-of-life domains. Inattentiveness was significantly predicting vitality and role-emotional outcomes, and hyperactivity/impulsivity predicted social function and mental health outcomes. © 2012 SAGE Publications.","ADD/ADHD; adult; outcomes","Adler, L.A., Sutton, V.K., Moore, R.J., Dietrich, A.P., Reimherr, F.W., Sangal, R.B., Allen, A.J., Quality of life assessment in adult patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder treated with atomoxetine (2006) Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology, 26, pp. 648-652; Amen, D.G., (1995) General adult ADD symptom checklist, , http://www.oneaddplace.com/addcheck.htm, Retrieved from; (1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , Washington, DC: Author.;, Washington, DC: Author; Barkley, R.A., Murphy, K.R., Impairment in occupational functioning and adult ADHD: The predictive utility of executive function (EF) ratings versus EF tests (2010) Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology, 25, pp. 157-173; Biederman, J., Faraone, S.V., Monuteaux, M.C., Bober, M., Cadogen, E., Gender effects on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults, revisited (2004) Biological Psychiatry, 55, pp. 692-700; Biederman, J., Faraone, S.V., Spencer, T., Wilens, T., Mick, E., Lapey, K.A., Gender differences in a sample of adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (1994) Psychiatry Research, 53, pp. 13-29; Biederman, J., Mick, E., Faraone, S.V., Age-dependent decline of symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Impact of remission definition and symptom type (2000) American Journal of Psychiatry, 157, pp. 816-818; Brod, M., Johnston, J., Able, S., Swindle, R., Validation of the adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder quality-of-life scale (AAQoL): A disease-specific quality-of-life measure (2006) Quality of Life Research, 15, pp. 117-129; Brod, M., Perwien, A., Adler, L., Spencer, T., Johnston, J., Conceptualization and assessment of quality of life for adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (2005) Primary Psychiatry, 12, pp. 58-64; Cumyn, L., French, L., Hechtman, L., Comorbidity in adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (2009) Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 54, pp. 673-683; de Graaf, R., Kessler, R.C., Fayyad, J., ten Have, M., Alonso, J., Angermeyer, M., Posada-Villa, J., The prevalence and effects of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on the performance of workers: Results from the WHO World Mental Health Survey Initiative (2008) Occupational Environmental Medicine, 65, pp. 835-842; Fayyad, J., de Graaf, R., Kessler, R., Alonso, J., Angermeyer, M., Demyttenaere, K., Zaslavsky, A.M., Cross-national prevalence and correlates of adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (2007) British Journal of Psychiatry, 190, pp. 402-409; Field, A., (2009) Discovering Statistics Using SPSS, , (3rd ed.).

Method: A total of 62 students (21 males, 41 females) were randomized to a 5-week intensive WM training program or a wait-list control group. Participants were evaluated before treatment, 3 weeks after completion, and at 2-month follow-up. The criterion measures were standardized tests of auditory-verbal and visual-spatial WM. Near transfer measures included other cognitive tasks; far transfer measures included academic tasks and behavioral rating scales. Results: Intent-to-treat analysis revealed that participants receiving WM training showed significantly greater improvements on the criterion WM measures and self-reported fewer ADHD symptoms and cognitive failures. The follow-up assessment indicated that gains in WM were maintained, as were improvements in cognitive failures. Conclusion: Computerized WM training is a feasible and possibly viable approach for enhancing WM in college students with ADHD or LD. © 2014 SAGE Publications.","academic performance; ADD/ADHD; college students; learning disabilities; working memory","Adler, L.A., Spencer, T., Faraone, S.V., Kessler, R.C., Howes, M.J., Biederman, J., Secnik, K., Validity of pilot Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) to rate adult ADHD symptoms (2006) Annals of Clinical Psychiatry, 18, pp. 145-148; Aldridge, R.L., Keith, B., Sloas, S., Mott-Murphree, A., Relationship of the Nelson Denny Reading Test to scores on the National Physical Therapy Licensure Examination (2010) Journal of Allied Health, 39, pp. 72-75; (2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , (4th ed., text rev.).

Moreover, comorbid psychiatric diagnoses in adults with ADHD were determined. Patients with and without ADHD were compared regarding DSM Axis I-II comorbidity and sociodemographic characteristics. Materials and Methods: The study included patients that presented for the first time to a psychiatric outpatient clinic during a 3-month period and were evaluated for adult ADHD. A sociodemographic form, Wender Utah Rating Scale, Turgay's Adult ADD/ADHD Evaluation Scale, Structured Clinical Interview I and II, Symptom Check List-90-R, and Beck Depression Inventory were administered. Results: The study included 246 patients. Among the 39 patients diagnosed with ADHD, 25 were female (64.1%) and 14 were male (35.9%), and the mean age was 27.38 ± 8.3 years. The prevalence of ADHD in adult psychiatric patients was 15.9%. Adults with ADHD usually presented due to comorbid psychiatric problems; major depression (43%), generalized anxiety disorder (23%), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (17%) were the most common comorbid diagnoses. Substance abuse (58.9%) and attempted suicide (38.5%) were among the most prevalent psychiatric problems.

There are several hypotheses regarding the etiology of ADHD. Although numerous researches have been conducted regarding neurobiology of pediatric ADHD, A-ADHD studies were relatively few. Many studies have indicated that oxidant mediated neuronal damage may play a role in the pathophysiology of various psychiatric disorders. Recently, oxidative stress has been studied in A-ADHD and there is an accumulating evidence to support its' role. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate catalase (CAT) and thiol levels in A-ADHD patients and compare with healthy controls. Materials-Methods: Twenty-five A-ADHD patients from Gaziantep University, diagnosed according to Turgay's Turkish version of Adult ADD/ADHD DSM IV-Based Diagnostic Screening and Rating Scale by two psychiatrists, and 25 healthy volunteer controls were included. The subjects strictly refrained from any substance intake and physical exercise after 08:00 p.m. on the day before collection. CAT and Thiol levels were measured in plasma samples of study groups. Results: Age, gender, and body mass indexes of patients and controls have shown homogeneity and there were no differences between the groups. Total score and subscores were not correlated with any of the mentioned biochemical parameters. The mean CAT levels in patients with ADHD were significantly higher and Thiol levels were lower than those of controls (<0.001, <0.001, respectively). When the comorbid patient group compared with pure A-ADHD patients in terms of CAT (11.49±0.28, 11.51±0.40, respectively) and thiol (0.22±0.05, 0.25±0.03, respectively) levels there were not found any significant differences (p=0.865, p=0.174, respectively). Conclusions: The results of the present study may indicate that thiol levels may be decreased with in reaction of increased CAT levels and thiol act like a pro-oxidant. This study may be considered as one of the initial phase studies that lighten the relationship between oxidative stress and A-ADHD. There is a need for further studies that will prove this relationship exactly.","Adult ADHD; Catalase; Oxidative stress; Thiol","Elliott, H., Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: A guide for the primary care physician (2002) Southern Medical Journal, 95 (7), pp. 736-742; (2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, 4th ed, text revision).

Participants were 36 adult speakers of Hebrew, who were administered a judgment test of 144 sentences, each containing an adjective in agreement with a plural noun in one of three different syntactic configurations-predicative adjectives, attributive adjectives in sentence-initial position, and attributive adjectives in sentence-final position. Noun suffixes were regular, semiregular (ambiguous), and irregular. Findings showed that participants with ADHD displayed lower accuracy and longer response time compared with controls. As morphological and morpho-syntactic difficulty simultaneously increased, participants with ADHD were significantly more likely to perform less well compared with controls on both accuracy and speed. These findings indicate that adults with ADHD might be suffering from a linguistic impairment exacerbated under more cognitively and linguistically demanding conditions. © 2014 Hammill Institute on Disabilities.","ADD/ADHD; Adult; Age; Assessment; Communication; Cultural/linguistic; Disorders; Diversity; Exceptionalities; Language; Language/linguistics; Syntax","(2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , (5th ed.).

There is, however, increased evidence that several temporal lobe regions could play an important role in ADHD. The present study used MRI-based measurements of cortical thickness to examine possible differences in both prefrontal and temporal lobe regions between medication-näive patients with ADHD (N=50) and age- and sex-matched typically developing controls (N=50). Subjects with ADHD exhibited significantly decreased cortical thickness in the right temporal pole and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) relative to healthy comparison subjects. These differences remained significant after controlling for confounding effects of age, overall mean cortical thickness and comorbid externalizing conditions, such as oppositional defiant and conduct disorders. These results point to the involvement of the temporal pole and OFC in the neuropathology of ADHD. Moreover, present findings add evidence to the assumption that multiple brain regions and psychological processes are associated with ADHD. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","ADHD; Cortical thickness; Emotional dysregulation; Orbitofrontal cortex; Temporal pole","Albert, J., López-Martín, S., Fernández-Jaén, A., Carretié, L., Emotional alterations in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: existing data and open questions [in Spanish] (2008) Revista de Neurologia, 47, pp. 39-45; Benjamini, Y., Krieger, A., Yekutieli, D., Adaptive linear step-up procedures that control the false discovery rate (2006) Biometrika, 93, pp. 491-507; Blaizot, X., Mansilla, F., Insausti, A.M., Constans, J.M., Salinas-Alaman, A., Pro-Sistiaga, P., Mohedano-Moriano, A., Insausti, R., The human parahippocampal region: I.

Indeed, using a newly developed EEG-based algorithm, hyperstable vigilance was found in MDD, and the contrary, with rapid drops to sleep stages, in mania. Furthermore, destabilising vigilance (e.g. by sleep deprivation) triggers (hypo)mania and improves depression, whereas stabilising vigilance, e.g. by prolonged sleep, improves mania. ADHD and mania have common symptoms, and the unstable vigilance might be a common pathophysiology. There is even evidence that psychostimulants might ameliorate both ADHD and mania. Hyperactivity of the noradrenergic system could explain both the high vigilance level in MDD and, as recently argued, anhedonia and behavioural inhibition. Interestingly, antidepressants and electroconvulsions decrease the firing rate of neurons in the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, whereas many antimanic drugs have opposite effects. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","ADHD; Anti-manic drugs; Antidepressants; Arousal; Autoregulatory behaviour; Bipolar disorder; Depression; EEG; Locus coeruleus; Mania; Noradrenergic system; Norepinephrine; Novelty seeking; Sensation seeking; Vigilance regulation","Abolfazli, R., Hosseini, M., Ghanizadeh, A., Ghaleiha, A., Tabrizi, M., Raznahan, M., Golalizadeh, M., Akhondzadeh, S., Double-blind randomized parallel-group clinical trial of efficacy of the combination fluoxetine plus modafinil versus fluoxetine plus placebo in the treatment of major depression (2011) Depress and Anxiety, 28, pp. 297-302; Agosti, V., Stewart, J.W., Atypical and non-atypical subtypes of depression: comparison of social functioning, symptoms, course of illness, co-morbidity and demographic features (2001) Journal of Affective Disorders, 65, pp. 75-79; Amit, B.H., Weizman, A., (2012), Antidepressant treatment for acute bipolar depression: an update.

The focus was gender differences across age, diagnostic group (ADHD-Inattentive/ADHD plus), neuropsychological test performance, and reported sleep symptoms over the lifespan. Individuals were assigned to ADHD-I group or ADHD plus group (based upon secondary diagnosis of sleep, behavioral, emotional disturbance); ADHD not primary was excluded (brain insult, psychosis). Among these were 1,828 children (ages 9 to 14), adolescents (ages 15 to 17), and adults (ages 18 and above); 446 children (312 diagnosed ADHD-I), 218 adolescents (163 diagnosed ADHD-I), and 1,163 adults (877 ADHDI). Sleep was problematic regardless of age, ADHD subtype, and gender. The type and number of sleep problems and fatigue were age dependent. ADHD subtype, gender, fatigue, age, and sleep (sleep onset, unrefreshing sleep, sleep maintenance) were significant variables affecting neuropsychological test performance (sequencing, cognitive flexibility, slow- and fast-paced input, divided attention, whole brain functioning). Findings suggest that ADHD involves numerous factors and symptoms beyond attention, such as sleep which interacts differently dependent upon age. © Psychological Reports 2014.",,"Achenbach, T.M., (1991) Manual for the Child Behavior Checklist/4-18 and 1991 Profile, , Burlington, VT: Univer. of Vermont, Dept. of Psychiatry; Adler, L.A., Epidemiology, impairments and diff erential diagnosis in adult ADHD: Introduction (2008) CNS Spectrums, 13 (8 SUPPL. 12), pp. 4-5; Amico, F., Stauber, J., Koutsouleris, N., Frodl, T., Anterior cingulate cortex gray matter abnormalities in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: A voxel-based morphometry study (2011) Psychiatry Research, 191 (1), pp. 31-35; Angold, A., Costello, E.J., Erkanli, A., Comorbidity (1999) Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 40, pp. 57-87; Bae, S.-M., Park, J.E., Lee, Y.J., Cho, I.H., Kim, J.-H., Koh, S.-H., Kim, S.J., Cho, S.-J., Gender diff erence in the association between adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms and morningness-eveningness (2010) Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, 64, pp. 649-651; Barkley, R., (1991) Patient Behavior Complaints Checklist for ADHD Adults., , New York: Guilford Press; Barkley, R., (1991) Physical Complaints Checklist for ADHD Adults, , New York: Guilford Press; Barkley, R.A., Fischer, M., Edelbrock, C.S., Smallish, L., The adolescent outcome of hyperactive children diagnosed by research criteria: I.

Previously, several studies reported association between SNAP-25 and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We investigated whether these SNAP-25 polymorphisms (MnlI T/G and DdelI T/C) were also associated with ADHD in the Turkish population. Methods: Our study comprised unrelated 139 subjects who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD and 73 controls and all were of Turkish origin. Genetic analyses were performed and patients were evaluated with Wender-Utah Rating Scale and Adult ADD/ADHD DSM IV-Based Diagnostic Screening and Rating Scale. Results: SNAP-25 DdelI polymorphism was not associated with ADHD but there was a statistically significant difference between ADHD patients and controls for SNAP-25 MnlI polymorphism. For SNAP-25 MnlI polymorphism patients with G/G genotype of the SNAP-25 gene MnlI polymorphism had higher Wender-Utah scores and higher scores in the 1st and 3rd parts of adult ADD/ADHD Scale. Conclusion: We detected a significant association of the MnlI polymorphism in our ADHD sample which was similar to previous findings. Our study also revealed that SNAP-25 MnlI polymorphism was also associated with symptom severity of ADHD. This study is also, the first report on the association of SNAP-25 with ADHD in the Turkish population. © 2014 Korean Neuropsychiatric Association.","ADHD; Genetic; SNAP-25 gene","(2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , 4 th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IVTR).

The sample used in the second phase of the study, which involved electrophysiological measurements, consisted of 17 subjects with ADHD (ADHD+; eight female, nine male) and 16 control subjects (ADHD-; nine female, seven male), all of whom obtained extreme scores on the Adult ADD/ADHD Scale and were right-handed. The effects of the stimulus conditions used in the selective attention neuropsychological task on behavior (correct response percentages and correct response latencies) and event-related potential parameters (amplitude and latency) were tested and analyzed through multivariate analysis of variance (2 × 5). The peak amplitudes of the P200 and P300 groups and the effect of the P300 peak on latency were significant. The relationships between the clinical scale scores and the amplitude and latency values were mostly obtained for the distracting stimuli. Furthermore, the anxiety and depression scores obtained using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2), as well as the lie and infrequency scale scores, were found to correlate with the total score from the ADD/ADHD Scale. These main results showed that a multi-technological bio-psychological approach involving the use of neuropsychological tasks that allow the observation of electrical activity in the bram during the evaluation of ADHD symptoms and personality introduces new perspectives and interpretations.","Adult ADD/ADHD scale; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; MMPI-2; MMPI-2 profile of ADHD; P200; P300","Aktepe, E., Dikkat eksikligi hiperaktivite bozukluʇu tanisi konan çocuk ve ergenlerde eş tanilar ve sosyodemografik özellikler (2011) Yeni Symposium, 49 (4), pp. 201-208; Köroglu, E., (2001) Psikiyatrik Hastaliklann Tammlanmasi ve Simflandirmasi Elkitabi.

The current clinical consensus is the result of the long evolution of a historical dichotomy between advocates for an organogenetic or psychopathological etiology of the disorder. Today, we question whether a ""double reading"" is possible taking into consideration both neuro-developmental factors as well as psychopathological elements? The contribution of complexity theorists and developmental phenomenology could help to conceptualize the ADD/ADHD as a complex and multifactorial disorder, which would support a ""transversal"" therapeutic approach involving psychoanalytical and psychopharmacology. However, questions remain regarding the effectiveness of psychoanalytical therapy and its association with pharmacotherapy in treating ADHD - and there appears to be little evidence of its effectiveness in existing literature. Thus, the possibility of a future therapeutic consensus for ADHD could be expected. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity; Case reports; Drug therapy; Evaluation studies as topic; Methylphenidate; Psychoanalytical therapy for children; Review","Adrian, V., (1998) Trouble hyperactivité et déficit de l'attention chez l'enfant et l'adolescent: comorbidité et tempérament.

Considering that attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) not only increases the risk but may also influence the molecular mechanisms of tobacco smoking, we analyzed the association between polymorphisms in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes and tobacco smoking among individuals with or without ADHD. The sample included 1,118 subjects divided into four groups according to smoking status and ADHD diagnosis. Our results demonstrate that the minor alleles of two polymorphisms (rs578776 and rs3743078) in the CHRNA3 gene are associated with an increased risk of tobacco smoking only among patients with ADHD. These alleles have been shown in previous studies to be protective factors for smoking in subjects without ADHD. These findings add to existing evidence that ADHD may exert an important modifying effect on the genetic risk of smoking and should be considered in tobacco smoking association studies. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Addiction; Attention; Comorbidity; Genetics; Hyperactivity; Nicotine","(1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association 4 American Psychiatric Press Washington; Aubin, H.J., Rollema, H., Svensson, T.H., Winterer, G., Smoking, quitting, and psychiatric disease: A review (2012) Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 36 (1), pp. 271-284. , 21723317 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2011.06.007; Barrett, J.C., Fry, B., Maller, J., Daly, M.J., Haploview: Analysis and visualization of LD and haplotype maps (2005) Bioinformatics, 21 (2), pp. 263-265. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2MXkt1WitQ%3D%3D 15297300 10.1093/bioinformatics/bth457; Bidwell, L.C., Garrett, M.E., McClernon, F.J., Fuemmeler, B.F., Williams, R.B., Ashley-Koch, A.E., A preliminary analysis of interactions between genotype, retrospective ADHD symptoms, and initial reactions to smoking in a sample of young adults (2012) Nicotine and Tobacco Research, 14 (2), pp. 229-233. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38Xhslylsbk%3D 3265740 21778150 10.1093/ntr/ntr125; Bierut, L.J., Stitzel, J.A., Wang, J.C., Hinrichs, A.L., Grucza, R.A., Xuei, X., Variants in nicotinic receptors and risk for nicotine dependence (2008) American Journal of Psychiatry, 165 (9), pp. 1163-1171. , 2574742 18519524 10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.07111711; Broms, U., Wedenoja, J., Largeau, M.R., Korhonen, T., Pitkaniemi, J., Keskitalo-Vuokko, K., Analysis of detailed phenotype profiles reveals CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 gene cluster association with several nicotine dependence traits (2012) Nicotine and Tobacco Research, 14 (6), pp. 720-733. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38XnsFGjt7w%3D 3356294 22241830 10.1093/ntr/ntr283; Bukstein, O.G., Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and substance use disorders (2012) Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences, 9, pp. 145-172. , 21789746 10.1007/7854-2011-148; Chen, X., Chen, J., Williamson, V.S., An, S.S., Hettema, J.M., Aggen, S.H., Variants in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors α5 and α3 increase risks to nicotine dependence (2009) American Journal of Medical Genetics.

Methods: Five parents, diagnosed with ADHD, had their dose of lisdexamfetamine (LDX) titrated to optimal effect. Next, parents and their adolescents completed two interactions, once when parents were on placebo and once when parents were on optimal dose of LDX, to assess acute effects of parental medication on parenting during a neutral discussion (NeuDiss), a problem discussion (ProbDiss), and a homework task (HW). Results: Parents demonstrated a significant decrease in the ratio of commands to total verbalizations during the NeuDiss on LDX compared with placebo. Although no other statistically significant effects emerged at the p<0.05 level, moderate to large effects of medication on some aspects of parenting related to the amount and timing of speech (i.e., total verbalizations, total commands, ratio of commands to total verbalizations, and responsiveness) emerged and varied by task. Parental stimulant medication did not appear to impact the content of parents' speech (i.e., use of negative talk or praise). Conclusions: These results add to a growing literature suggesting that treatment for parental ADHD may impact parenting performance, and suggest that attention to parental ADHD in treatment for adolescents with ADHD may possibly enhance family functioning. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.",,"(1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association 4th ed.

The current study investigated occupational status in adult ADHD patients before and after long-term CS treatment (median duration of treatment 33 months) and aimed to identify variables associated with improvement in occupational status. The collection of data was based on a naturalistic, retrospective approach using the medical records of a sample of all 117 adult ADHD patients consecutively starting treatment with CS in a specific catchment area in Norway in the period 1997 to May 2005. Most patients did not improve in occupational status during long-term CS treatment. The improved group had significantly higher baseline ADHD symptoms as measured by the general adult ADD symptom checklist (83.7 vs. 76.2, p = 0.024) and had a significantly shorter period from the first contact with adult psychiatry until they got the ADHD diagnosis (11.7 vs. 50.9 months, p = 0.001). The results indicate that long-term CS treatment itself may have limited effect on occupational status in functionally impaired and highly comorbid patients with adult ADHD. A high baseline ADHD symptom level may be related to a superior outcome in occupational status. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.","Adult; Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; Central stimulants; Occupational outcome","Adamou, M., Arif, M., Asherson, P., Aw, T.C., Bolea, B., Coghill, D., Occupational issues of adults with ADHD (2013) BMC Psychiatry, 13, p. 59. , PID: 23414364; Airaksinen, O., Brox, J.I., Cedraschi, C., Hildebrandt, J., Klaber-Moffett, J., Kovacs, F., Chapter 4.

Research has indicated that using SCT symptoms to identify a subset of youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, predominately inattentive type (ADHD-IT) may elucidate distinct patterns of impairment and thereby improve the external validity of ADHD subtypes. The objective of the current study was to investigate whether youth with clinically-assessed ADHD-IT and high levels of SCT exhibit unique social and academic impairments. In a clinic-referred sample of youth (N = 209; 23 % female) aged 6 to 17 years, participants who met criteria for three different groups were identified: ADHD, Combined Type (ADHD-CT; n = 80), ADHD-IT with low SCT symptoms (n = 74), and ADHD-IT with high SCT symptoms (n = 55). These groups were compared on indicators of social and academic functioning while considering the effects of co-occurring internalizing and disruptive behavior disorders. Youth with ADHD-IT high in SCT exhibited uniquely elevated withdrawal, as well as low leadership and low peer-directed relational and overt aggression, which were not accounted for by co-occurring disorders. This high-SCT group was also the only group to have more homework problems than the ADHD-CT group, but only when other disruptive behavior disorders were absent. The distinctiveness of the high-SCT group, which was primarily evident in social as opposed to academic functioning, provides partial support for the external validity and clinical utility of SCT. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Academic functioning; Attention deficit disorder; Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; Impairment; Sluggish cognitive tempo; Social functioning","Achenbach, T.M., (1991) Manual for the Child Behavior checklist/4-18, and 1991 Profile, , University of Vermont Department of Psychiatry Burlington; ADHD: Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents (2011) Pediatrics, 128 (5), pp. 1-16. , American Academy of Pediatrics 10.1542/peds.2011-2654 10.1542/peds.digest1285; (1980) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association 3 Author Washington; (1991) DSM-IV Options Book: Work in Progress, , American Psychiatric Association Author Washington; (1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association 4 Author Washington; Proposed Revisions: Attention Deficit/hyperactivity Disorder, , http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevision/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=383#, American Psychiatric Association (2012); Anesko, K.M., Schoiock, G., Ramírez, R., Levine, F.M., The homework problems checklist: Assessing children's homework difficulties (1987) Behavioral Assessment, 9, pp. 179-185; Antshel, K.M., Remer, R., Social skills training in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: A randomized-controlled clinical trial (2003) Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, 32 (1), pp. 153-165. , 12611031; Barkley, R.A., Distinguishing sluggish cognitive tempo from attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder in adults (2012) Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 121, pp. 978-990. , 10.1037/a0023961 21604823 10.1037/a0023961; Barkley, R.A., Dupaul, G.J., McMurray, M.B., Comprehensive evaluation of attention deficit disorder with and without hyperactivity as defined by research criteria (1990) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 58, pp. 775-789. , 2292627 10.1037/0022-006X.58.6.775; Barkley, R.A., Dupaul, G.J., McMurray, M.B., Attention deficit disorder with and without hyperactivity: Clinical response to three dose levels of methylphenidate (1991) Pediatrics, 87, pp. 519-531. , 2011430; Barkley, R.A., Murphy, K.R., Fischer, M., (2008) ADHD in Adults: What the Science Says, , Guildford Press New York; Bauermeister, J.J., Barkley, R.A., Bauermeister, J.A., Martínez, J.V., McBurnett, K., Validity of the sluggish cognitive tempo, inattention, and hyperactivity symptom dimensions: Neuropsychological and psychosocial correlates (2012) Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, 40, pp. 683-697. , 10.1007/s10802-011-9602-7 22179974 10.1007/s10802-011-9602-7; Becker S., .P., Langberg J., .M., Sluggish cognitive tempo among young adolescents with ADHD: Relations to mental health, academic, and social functioning (2012) Journal of Attention Disorders.

This is because many of the phenotypic features of DS may resemble the clinical manifestations of DS and the myriad methodological challenges in diagnosing ADHD in children with intellectual disabilities (ID). With this in mind, the authors set to determine the prevalence of ADHD symptomatology in a cohort of children and young adults in a DS clinic. Subjects were 83 children and adults, ages 5-38, who were attending the Down Syndrome Center at the Hadassah Mount Scopus University Medical Center. All were screened for ADHD. Screening methods included review of medical files, telephone interviews, and use of the ADHD module of the Autism-Tics, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity disorder, and other Comorbidities questionnaire. It was found that 26 (31.3%) of the subjects fulfilled the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.) criteria for ADHD. Of these, 17 (65.4%) were diagnosed as predominantly inattentive type. Four (15.4%) were predominantly impulsive-hyperactive, and five (19.2%) had the combined type. No statistically significant association was found between ADHD and age, sex, number of siblings, presence of heart disease, thyroid dysfunction, sleep disorders, or a family history of ADHD. The prevalence of ADHD symptomatology among individuals with DS in this representative sample is high compared with the general population. ADHD may be underdiagnosed in this special population, hence the need for systematic screening. © 2014 International Association for the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ADD/ADHD; Down syndrome; Dual diagnosis; Intellectual disabilities; Learning disabilities","Aman, M.G., Armstrong, S., Buican, B., Sillick, T., Four-year follow-up of children with low intelligence and ADHD: A replication (2002) Research in Developmental Disabilities, 23, pp. 119-134; (1987) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , American Psychiatric Association.

The present guidelines summarise current literature, generating expert consensus recommendations for the treatment of ADHD in children and adults. These guidelines also provide a review of recent research in the fields of neuroimaging, neuropsychology and genetics of ADHD. Novel discoveries in these areas have informed physiological models for the disease. Since the publication of the previous British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines in 2008, new drugs have been licensed and further compounds are being investigated. The publication of randomised controlled trials of psychological interventions has contributed to the range of treatment options for ADHD. As the disorder has been diagnosed more frequently there has been greater focus on comorbid conditions and how they impact treatment. Services have continued to develop for the treatment of ADHD in adults and care agreements have been introduced to facilitate access to treatment. © 2014 The Author(s).","ADD; ADHD; attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder; BAP; hyperkinetic disorder","Adler, L.A., Goodman, D.W., Kollins, S.H., Double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (2008) J Clin Psychiatry, 69, pp. 1364-1373; Aman, M.G., Langworthy, K.S., Pharmacotherapy for hyperactivity in children with autism and other pervasive developmental disorders (2000) J Autism Dev Disord, 30, pp. 451-459; Aman, M.G., Binder, C., Turgay, A., Risperidone effects in the presence/absence of psychostimulant medicine in children with ADHD, other disruptive behavior disorders, and subaverage IQ (2004) J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol, 14, pp. 243-254; Aman, M.G., Buican, B., Arnold, L.E., Methylphenidate treatment in children with borderline IQ and mental retardation: Analysis of three aggregated studies (2003) J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol, 13, pp. 29-40; (2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , 5th ed.

This article provides a review of the 2010 version of the eCOVE classroom observation software in terms of its utility in tracking the progress of children with attention and hyperactive behaviors and its use in evaluating teacher behaviors that may impede or promote children's attention and positive behavior. The eCOVE shows promise as an efficient tool for psychologists and behavioral consultants who want to evaluate the effects of interventions for children with symptoms of ADHD, ODD, mood disorders and learning disorders; however, some research-based improvements for future models are suggested. The reviewers also share their firsthand experience in using eCOVE to evaluate teacher and student behavior exhibited on a television show about teaching urban high school students and during a movie about an eccentric new kindergarten teacher. Rich examples are provided of using strategic behavioral observations to reveal how to improve the classroom environment so as to facilitate attention, motivation and positive behavior among youth. Broader implications for enhancing the use of systematic behavioral observations in the assessment of children and adolescents with attention disorders and related behavioral problems are discussed. Key issues are examined such as the use of behavioral observations during psychological consultation to prevent the previously found gender bias in referrals for ADHD. Using behavioral observations to enhance differential diagnosis is also discussed. © 2012 SAGE Publications.","ADD/ADHD; adolescents; inattention; observation; teachers","(2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , (4th ed., text rev.).

Methods For the systematic review, databases searched included Pubmed, Psychinfo, Web of Science, Embase, Biosis and Medline. Results Three articles were found with a total sample of 41 children exposed to methylphenidate in pregnancy. Malformations reported included congenital heart defects (n = 2), finger abnormalities (syndactyly, adactyly and polydactyly n = 2) and limb malformations (n = 1). Other problems included premature birth, asphyxia and growth retardation. One case report (n = 1) and one case series (n = 3) were identified regarding exposure to methylphenidate through breast feeding. In all cases, children developed normally and no adverse effects were reported. In our case report we describe an infant exposed to methylphenidate during pregnancy and breast feeding, who developed normally having no detectable congenital abnormalities. Conclusions The number and size of the studies found were small. Identified cases were not representative of the general adult ADHD population having methylphenidate as monotherapy during pregnancy as all the articles reported combinations of methylphenidate with either known teratogenic drugs or drugs of abuse. There is a paucity of data regarding the use of methylphenidate in pregnancy and further studies are required. Although the default medical position is to interrupt any non-essential pharmacological treatment during pregnancy and lactation, in ADHD this may present a significant risk. Doctors need to evaluate each case carefully before interrupting treatment. © 2013 The British Pharmacological Society.","ADD; ADHD; hyperactivity; lactation; methylphenidate; pregnancy","(2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association. 4th edn.

The diagnosis of ADHD was confirmed by an independent multi-disciplinary team using ICD-10 diagnosis for diagnostic accuracy and criterion validity. The convergent and divergent validity were assessed by another rater. The data was analyzed for diagnostic accuracy, reliability and validity appropriately.Results: An ACTeRS score of ≥61 [Sensitivity (Sn) =85.51 %; Specificity (Sp) = 90.24 %; Area under the curve (AUC) = 0.94] is appropriate for the diagnosis of ADHD. The test-re-test reliability [Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.87], internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.80; range of 0.89–0.93), section-total correlation, face and content validity for the ACTeRS were good. Convergent validity of attention deficit, hyperactivity and oppositional subscales of ACTeRS with the corresponding subscales of Swanson, Nolan & Pelham Rating Scale—Revised (SNAP-IV) was moderate (r = 0.60, P = 0.005; r = 0.49, P = 0.02; r = 0.58, P = 0.008 respectively), and negative correlation with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (r = −0.36; P =0.1) for divergent validity was found. The criterion validity analysis showed a high concordance rate of 82.52 % between ACTeRS and International Classification of Diseases, Edition10 (ICD-10) diagnosis of ADHD. A 4-factor structure was replicated.Conclusions: The ACTeRS has adequate psychometric properties for use in the Indian population for identifying ADHD. © 2014, Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.","Attention deficit; Hyperactivity; India; Validation","Srinath, S., Girimaji, S.C., Gururaj, G., Seshadri, S., Subbakrishna, D.K., Bhola, P., Epidemiological study of child & adolescent psychiatric disorders in urban & rural areas of Bangalore, India (2005) Indian J Med Res, 122, pp. 67-79. , PID: 16106093; Collett, B.R., Ohan, J.L., Myers, K.M., Ten-year review of rating scales.

Meta-analysis was conducted for two major exposure sources; i.e., thimerosal vaccines that contain ethylmercury (clinical exposure), and environmental sources, using relevant literature published before April 2014. While thimerosal exposures did not show any material associations with an increased risk of ASD or ADHD (the summary odds ratio (OR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80-1.24 for ASD; OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.70-1.13 for ADHD/ADD), significant associations were observed for environmental exposures in both ASD (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.14-2.17) and ADHD (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.10-2.33). The summary ORs were similar after excluding studies not adjusted for confounders. Moderate adverse effects were observed only between environmental inorganic or organic mercury exposures and ASD/ADHD. However, these results should be interpreted with caution since the number of epidemiological studies on this issue was limited and still at an early stage. Further studies focused on subjects with genetic vulnerabilities of developmental disorders are warranted for better understanding of the effects of such environmental exposures. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","ADHD; Autism; Mercury exposure; Meta-analysis; Thimerosal","Andrews, N., Miller, E., Grant, A., Stowe, J., Osborne, V., Taylor, B., Thimerosal exposure in infants and developmental disorders: a retrospective cohort study in the United Kingdom does not support a causal association (2004) Pediatrics, 114, pp. 584-591; Aschner, M., Ceccatelli, S., Are neuropathological conditions relevant to ethylmercury exposure?

We used cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2001-2004). Phthalate metabolites with ≥75% detection in urine samples were examined. The study population comprised 1493 children with parent-reported information on ADD or LD diagnosis and phthalate concentrations in urine. Phthalate concentrations were creatinine-adjusted and log10-transformed for analysis. All models controlled for child sex, age, race, household income, blood lead, and maternal smoking during pregnancy. There were 112 ADD cases, 173 LD cases, and 56 ADD and LD cases in the sample. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found increased odds of ADD with increasing urinary concentration of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalates (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.1, 3.9) and high molecular weight phthalates (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.2, 6.1). In addition, dibutyl phthalates (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 0.9, 12.7) and high molecular weight phthalates (OR: 3.7; 95% CI: 0.9, 14.8) were marginally associated with increased odds of co-occurring ADD and LD. We did not find associations for any phthalate and LD alone. We observed stronger associations between phthalates and ADD and both ADD and LD in girls than boys in some models. We found cross-sectional evidence that certain phthalates are associated with increased odds of ADD and both ADD and LD. Further investigations with longitudinal data are needed to confirm these results. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894643349

Method: A total of 135 patients with BD type I and II and BD not otherwise specified were included in this study. First, the Adult ADD/ADHD DSM-IV-Based Diagnostic Screening and Rating Scale (ADHD scale) was administered to all patients, and all of the patients were also interviewed for the diagnosis. Patients who were diagnosed as having ADHD comorbidity (n=23) on the basis of DSM-IV and those who were not diagnosed to have ADHD comorbidity (n=32) were compared in terms of sociodemographic and clinical correlates. Results: Twenty-three of 135 patients (17%) were found to have ADHD comorbidity. In the ADHD comorbidity group, the level of education and the number of suicide attempts were higher (p=0.011 and 0.043, respectively). Although not significant, sub-threshold depressive symptoms in interepisodic periods, the lifetime history of antidepressant use and the total number of lifetime depressive episodes tended to be more frequent in bipolar disorder with ADHD comorbidity group than in the control group. Conclusion: Bipolar disorder has a frequent comorbidity with ADHD, and contrary to expectations, it might be related to the depressive aspect, rather than the manic aspect, of bipolar disorder. Early diagnosis of ADHD comorbidity in bipolar patients mimight help to prevent serious risk factors. © Archives of Neuropsychiatry.","Adult attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder; Bipolar disorder; Comorbidity; Depressive symptoms","Tamam, L., Karakus, G., Ozpoyraz, N., Comorbidity of adult attention-deficity hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder: Prevalence and clinical correlates (2008) Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci, 258 (7), pp. 385-393; Kent, L., Craddock, N., Is there a relationship between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder?

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of ADHD on the temperament and personality of BP-I patients in remission. Methods: Patients with a BP-I disorder diagnosis (n=121, female 71, male 50) were matched with control group with no known psychiatric illness (n=100, female 55, male 45) according to age, sex, education were recruited from consecutive admissions. After the sociodemographic form, SCID-I for childhood and adult ADHD and the other axis-I diagnoses according to DSM-IV criteria and SCID-II have been applied to all patients and control group. All patients were interviewed for the presence and history of current adult and child-hood ADHD diagnosis. The subjects also completed the Adult ADD/ADHD DSM-IV Based Diagnostic and Screening Rating Scale Turkish version and the Turkish version of TEMPS-A Scale. Results: Adult ADHD diag-nosis were observed in bipolar I patients with 21.7% (n=26) and in control group with 7% (n=7). Temperament measurements revealed depressive type was found more commonly in the pure BP-I and the comorbid BP-I with adult ADHD group compared to the pure control group. There was no severe depressive temperament in the pure control group. When BP-I and the comorbid BP-I with adult ADHD group were analysed separately for the depressive temperament, there were no difference between the pure BP-I and the comorbid BP-I with adult ADHD group. The the comorbid BP-I with adult ADHD group were observed to have moderate/severe episodes, earlier and longer maintenance treatment periods. All three groups differ in terms of personality disorder. Antisocial personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder were observed only in the comorbid BP-I with adult ADHD group. Conclusion: BP-I disorder comorbid with adult ADHD has significant clinical implications which may relate to a personality disorder. This may be due to the influence of ADHD on BP-I disorder.","Adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Affective temperament; Bipolar disorder; Personality","Haustgen, T., Akiskal, H., French antecedents of 'contemporary' concepts in the American Psychiatric Association's classification of bipolar (mood) disorders (2006) J Affect Disord, 96, pp. 149-163; Akiskal, H.S., Dysthymia and cyclothymia in psychiatric practice a century after Kraepelin (2001) J Affect Disord, 62, pp. 17-31; Vahip, S., Kesebir, S., Alkan, M., Yazici, O., Akiskal, K.K., Akiskal, H.S., Affective temperament in clinically well subjects in Turkey: Initial psychometric data on The TEMPS-A (2005) J Affect Disord, 85, pp. 113-125; Blazer, I.I.D.G., Mood disorders: Epidemiology (2000) Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 1, pp. 1298-1308. , BJ Sadock, VA Sadock, (Eds, seventh ed, Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams and Wilkins; Akiskal, H.S., Hirschfeld, R.M., Yerevanian, B.I., The relationship of personality to affective disorders (1983) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 40 (7), pp. 801-810; Heerlein, A., Richter, P., Gonzalez, M., Santander, J., Personality patterns and outcome in depressive and bipolar disorders (1998) Psychopathology, 31 (1), pp. 15-22; George, E.L., Miklowitz, D.J., Richards, J.A., Simoneau, T.L., Taylor, D.O., The comorbidity of bipolar disorder and axis II personality disorders: Prevalence and clinical correlates (2003) Bipolar Disord, 5, pp. 115-122; Tamam, L., Karakus, G., Ozpoyraz, N., Comorbidity of adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder: Prevalence and clinical correlates (2008) Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci, 258 (7), pp. 385-393; Kent, L., Craddock, N., Is there a relationship be-tween attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder?

Sixteen parents were interviewed twice and two parents were interviewed once. Data were analysed using grounded theory methods. Findings indicated that parents' perspectives were primarily concerned with trying to control their child's difficult behaviours. The substantive theory of Gaining Control that emerged explains the processes that parents used to try to control these behaviours. Two parental controlling/coping pathways were identified. An emotional pathway was associated with negative parental behaviours, poor outcomes, and high distress. The cognitive pathway was associated with surprisingly positive outcomes and low levels of distress. Important outcomes identified included achieving a positive cooperative relationship and highly elevated volitional performance. Processes and subprocesses are described and explained in detail. These findings may have significant clinical and educational implications for enhancing outcomes for the parents and their child. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","AD/HD; ADD; ADHD; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; control; coping; discipline; education; motivation; parents; stress","(2000) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , 4th edn,: text rev, American Psychological Association, Washington, DC,American Psychological Association (APA); Barkley, R.A., Behavioral inhibition, sustained attention, and executive functions: constructing a unifying theory of ADHD (1997) Psychological Bulletin, 121, pp. 65-94; Barkley, R.A., The executive functions and ADHD (2000) Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 39, pp. 1064-1068; Beike, S., Zentall, S., ""The snake raised its head"": content novelty alters the reading performance of students at risk for reading disabilities and ADHD (2012) Journal of Educational Psychology, 104, pp. 529-540; Blackledge, D., Hunt, B., (1985) Sociological interpretations of education, , : Croom Helm, London; Bullard, J.A., Parent perceptions of the effect of ADHD child behavior on the family: the impact and coping strategies (1997) Dissertation Abstracts International, 57, pp. 9B; Carlson, C., Tamm, L., Responsiveness of children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder to reward and response cost: differential impact on performance and motivation (2000) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 68 (1), pp. 73-83; Cunningham, C., Benness, B., Siegel, L., Family functioning, time allocation and parental depression in the families of normal and ADDH children (1988) Journal of Clinical Child Psychology, 17, pp. 169-177; Daley, D., Sonuga-Barke, E.J., Thompson, M., Assessing expressed emotion in mothers of preschool AD/HD children: psychometric properties of a modified speech sample (2003) British Journal of Clinical Psychology, 42, pp. 53-67; Davis, C.C., Claudius, M., Palinkas, L., Putting families in the center: family perspectives on decision making and AD/HD and implications for AD/HD care (2012) Journal of Attention Disorders, 16 (8), pp. 675-684. , Wong, JB & Leslie, LK, ', ', vol, no; Deci, E., Ryan, R., Human autonomy: the basis for true self-esteem (1995) Efficacy, agency and self-esteem, pp. 31-49. , In: Kernis M, editors ', ', ed.,: Plenum, New York; DuPaul, G.J., Weyandt, L.L., School-based interventions for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: effects on academic, social, and behavioural functioning (2006) International Journal of Disability Development and Education, 53 (2), pp. 161-176; Fisher, S., (1984) Stress and the perception of control, , : Lawrence Erlbaum, London; Folkman, S., Personal control and stress and coping processes: a theoretical analysis (1984) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 46 (4), pp. 839-852; Folkman, S., Moskowitz, J.T., Coping: pitfalls and promise (2004) Annual Review of Psychology, 55, pp. 745-774; Gerdes, A., Hoza, B., Maternal attributions, affect, and parenting in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and comparison families (2006) Journal of Clinical Child & Adolescent Psychology, 35 (3), pp. 346-355; Glow, P., Glow, R., Hyperkinetic impulse disorder: a developmental defect of motivation (1979) Genetic Psychology Monographs, 100, pp. 159-231; Graziano, P., McNamara, J., Geffken, G., Reid, A., Severity of children's ADHD symptoms and parenting stress: a multiple mediation model of self-regulation (2011) Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, 39, pp. 1073-1083; Grolnick, W.E., Apostoleris, N., What makes parents controlling?

In contrast, broad-spectrum micronutrient interventions appear in early trials to be as effective as psychiatric medications with fewer adverse effects for treating mood disorders, ADHD, aggressivity, and misconduct in youth and adults. Broad-spectrum treatments also may improve stress responses, cognition, and sense of well-being in healthy adults, but have been less well studied in youth.

The 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health (N = 95,677) was used to estimate prevalence of parent-reported mental health problems in children. Prevalence of mental disorders was 22.9% among children born prematurely, 28.7% among very-low-birth-weight (<1500 g) children, and 18.9% among moderately low-birth-weight (1500-2499 g) children, compared with 15.5% in the general child population. Compared to those born full term, children born prematurely had 61% higher adjusted odds of serious emotional/behavioral problems, 33% higher odds of depression, and 58% higher odds of anxiety. Children born prematurely had 2.3 times higher odds of autism/ASD, 2.9 times higher odds of development delay, and 2.7 times higher odds of intellectual disability than term children. Very-low-birth-weight children had 3.2 times higher odds of autism/ASD, 1.7 times higher odds of ADD/ADHD, 5.4 times higher odds of development delay, and 4.4 times higher odds of intellectual disability than normal-birth-weight children. Social factors were significant predictors of mental disorders in both premature/low-birth-weight and term/normal-birth-weight children. Neurodevelopmental conditions accounted for the relationship between prematurity and depression/anxiety/conduct problems. Prematurity and low birthweight are significant risk factors for mental health problems among children. © 2013 Gopal K.

We tested the hypothesis that lower AChE activity is associated with lower neurobehavioral development among children living in Ecuadorian floricultural communities. METHODS: In 2008, we examined 307 children (age: 4-9 years; 52% male) and quantified AChE activity and neurodevelopment in 5 domains: Attention/executive functioning, language, memory/learning, visuospatial processing, and sensorimotor (NEPSY-II test). Associations were adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and height-for-age, flower worker cohabitation, and hemoglobin concentration. RESULTS: Mean ± standard deviation AChE activity was 3.14 ± 0.49 U/mL (similar for both genders). The range of scores among neurodevelopment subtests was 5.9 to 10.7 U (standard deviation: 2.6-4.9 U). Girls had a greater mean attention/executive functioning domain score than boys. In boys only, there were increased odds ratios of low (<9th percentile) neurodevelopment among those in the lowest tertile versus the highest tertile of AChE activity (odds ratios: Total neurodevelopment: 5.14 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84 to 31.48]; attention/executive functioning domain: 4.55 [95% CI: 1.19 to 17.38], memory/learning domain: 6.03 [95% CI: 1.17 to 31.05]) after adjustment for socioeconomic and demographic factors, height-forage, and hemoglobin. Within these domains, attention, inhibition and long-term memory subtests were most affected. CONCLUSIONS: Low AChE activity was associated with deficits in neurodevelopment, particularly in attention, inhibition, and memory in boys but not in girls. These critical cognitive skills affect learning and academic performance.

Symptoms included chronic headache syndromes, abdominal symptoms, fatigue, and some with behavioral or learning problems. Among these patients were 12 children with a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD) whose parents were seeking either to avoid the use of stimulant medication or seek an alternative to prescribed treatment. Evaluation included a careful nutritional/dietary history, questionnaire for symptoms of gluten sensitivity (GS), and in select cases, laboratory evaluation for thyroid function, GS, and genetic analysis for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphism. Among the large group of children, of 15 screened for MTHFR polymorphism, 14 were positive. Of nine children with a history of ADD/ADHD, 8 were positive. Of 43 children with a history suggesting possible GS, 32 were found to have elevated antigliadin IgG antibodies. This included 10 of the 12 children with a diagnosis of ADD/ADHD. One child on stimulant treatment for ADHD was found to have laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism with tissue resistance to thyroid hormone, and thyroid function normalized and markedly elevated reverse T3 dropped substantially after discontinuation of stimulant treatment for 8 weeks. Clinical experience here supports the idea that among children with chronic health problems that include a behavioral or learning component, consideration of possible GS, genetic polymorphism for MTHFR, and thyroid function may be appropriate. © 2013 Springer Publishing Company.",,"Bizzaro, N., Tozzoli, R., Villalta, D., Fabris, M., Tonutti, E., Cutting-edge issues in celiac disease and in gluten intolerance (2012) Clinical Reviews in Allergy and Immunology, 42, pp. 279-287. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12016-010-8223-1; (2013) Array 3- antibody-Wheat/gluten proteome reactivity & autoimmunity, , http://www.cyrexlabs.com/Portals/0/Docs/ClinicalApplications/ClinicalAppArray3.pdf, Cyrex Labs; Davis, R.D., (2013) Common characteristics of dyslexia, , http://www.dyslexia.com/library/symptoms.htm; Fasano, A., (2013) How does gluten sensitivity differ from celiac disease?, , http://www.celiaccenter.org/gluten_faq.aspdiffer; Ford, R., (2006) Full of it!

Thirty-one participants (nine controls, seven obstructive sleep hypopnea/apnoea (OSH/OSA), eight narcolepsy and seven attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity (ADD/ADHD)) completed a 36-hour sleep deprivation cycle. Every six hours, a drive simulator session was synchronised with oculometric and electroencephalography (EEG) measures, followed by objective (test of variables of attention (TOVA), maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT)) and subjective (Stanford sleepiness scale (SSS)) measures of alertness and performance. A sleep-deprivation effect was confirmed throughout all six sessions. Narcoleptic participants performed significantly worse in the drive simulator, followed by the ADD/ADHD group, while the control and OSH/OSA groups had similar performance. Accident events in the drive simulator had significant regression with percentage of eyelid closure over the pupil over time (PERCLOS), eye blink duration (EBD) and eye blink rate (EBR) at sessions four and five, accounting for a significant percentage of the variations in crash accidents and road-edge excursion. Oculometric variables were sensitive to sleep deprivation with predictive circadian effects on the performance/vigilance relationship. These results contributed to the early design of a composite oculometric fatigue index (COFI) and safety response algorithm, which can be integrated into different real-world operator domains.",,"Barkley, R.A., (2000) Taking Charge of ADHD, p. 21. , New York: The Guilford Press; Bristow, D., Frith, C., Rees, G., Two distinct neural effects of blinking processing (2005) Neuro Image, 27 (1), pp. 136-145. , 1: 1 August 2005; Carskadon, M., Dement, W., Cumulative effects of sleep restriction on daytime sleepiness (1991) Psychophysiology, 18, pp. 107-113; Carskadon, M.A., Rosekind, M.R., Galli, J., Sohn, J., Herman, K.B., Davis, S.S., Adolescent sleepiness during sleep restriction in the natural environment (1989) Sleep Res, 18, p. 115; Chervin, R.D., Dillon, J.E., Bassetti, C., Ganoczy, D.A., Pituch, K.J., Symptoms of sleep disorders, inattention, and hyperactivity in children (1997) Sleep, 20, pp. 1185-1192; De Nisco, S., Tiago, C., Kravitz, C., Evaluation and treatment of pediatric ADHD (2009) The Nurse Practitioner, 30 (8), pp. 14-23; Dinges, D., Grace, R., Perclos: A valid psycho-physiological measure of alertness as assessed by psychomotor vigilance (1998) FHA Tech Brief, , Publication No. FHWA-MCRT-98-006; Fallone, G., Acebo, C., Arnedt, J.T., Seifer, R., Carskadon, M.A., Effects of acute sleep restriction on behavior, sustained attention, and response inhibition in children (2001) Percept Mot Skills, 93, pp. 213-229; (1998) PERCLOS: A Valid Psycho-physiological Measure of Alertness as Assessed by Psychomotor Vigilance, , Federal Highway Administration FHWA, US Department of Transportation; Findley, L.J., Unvrzagtm, M., Guchu, R., Fabrizio, M., Buckner, J., Suratt, P., Vigilance and automotive accidents in patients with sleep apnea or narcolepsy (1995) Chest, 108 (3), pp. 619-624; Gozal, D., Wang, M., Pope Jr., D.W., Objective sleepiness measures in pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (2001) Pediatrics, 108, pp. 693-697; Hakkanen, J., Summala, H., Sleepiness at work among commercial truck drivers (2000) Sleep, 23, pp. 49-57; (1994), Institute for Traffic Safety Management and Research, New York State Task Force on the Impact on Fatigue on Driving.

To investigate predictors of offending behaviour as well as variables associated with previous involvement in firesetting behaviour and offending severity. Method Data collected at the time of the FAIP intervention was provided by the New Zealand Fire Service and the offence histories of the sample were accessed from the New Zealand Police database (NIA). Data were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Results Although the arson recidivism rate was low (2%), rates of general offending were high, with 59% of the sample having committed an offence during the follow-up period. Fifteen percent of the sample was classified as severe offenders, 40% as moderate and 4% as minor. Of offenders, 12.6% had been imprisoned during the follow-up period. Offending was predicted by experience of abuse and a previous firesetting behaviour at the time of the FAIP intervention. Living with both parents at the time of intervention decreased the probability of an individual engaging in future offending behaviour. The presence of family stress and a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Disorder or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD/ADHD) were associated with previous firesetting behaviour. In addition, involvement with family violence (as a perpetrator, complainant or victim) was associated with more severe offending behaviour. Conclusions In light of existing research, the findings of this study indicate that many firesetters are at risk for future offending and that identification of high-risk individuals is therefore an important consideration for any organization involved with firesetters. To minimize this risk, there is a need for a collaborative, multiagency approach to firesetting behaviour involving comprehensive risk assessment and appropriate referral for at-risk individuals. © 2013 The Authors.

CP limits a person's muscular function. Rehabilitative, touch-screen gaming promises to assist in developing muscle tone and dexterity for hemi-paretic CP patients as well as help therapists keep track of a patient's performance over time. However, most systems fail to take into account other factors of the disorder that could affect the scoring of a patient differently on various assessment days - specifically attention deficit or distraction. Cerebral Palsy is frequently associated with diagnosed Attention Deficit (Hyperactive) Disorder (ADD/ADHD), but even if a child does not fall within that definition, pediatric CP patients are often easily distracted. In this work we perform attention deficit simulation experiments with able-bodied users playing three rehabilitative games as well as similar computer generated data and propose a methodology to model and eliminate the effects of attention deficit or distraction from the scoring scheme used to evaluate the patient's motor abilities and progress over time. © 2013 ACM.","attention deficit; cerebral palsy; rehabilitative gaming","CDC - Cerebral Palsy, Home - NCBDDD, , http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/cp/index.html; A Rehab Revolution - American Stroke Association, , http://www.strokeassociation.org/idc/groups/stroke-public/@wcm/@hcm/@sta / documents/downloadable/ucm310314.pdf; Bierre, K., Chetwynd, J., Ellis, B., Hinn, D.M., Ludi, S., Westin, T., Game not over: Accessibility issues in video games (2005) Proc. of the 3rd International Conference on Universal Access in Human-Computer Interaction, pp. 22-27; Collins, R., (2004) Interaction Ritual Chains, , Princeton University Press; Craft, S., White, D.A., Park, T.S., Figiel, G., Visual attention in children with perinatal brain injury: Asymmetric effects of bilateral lesions (1994) Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 6 (2), pp. 165-173; Deluca, S.C., Echols, K., Law, C.R., Ramey, S.L., Intensive pediatric constraint-induced therapy for children with cerebral palsy: Randomized, controlled, crossover trial (2006) Journal of Child Neurology, 21 (11), pp. 931-938; Eliasson, A.-C., Krumlinde-Sundholm, L., Shaw, K., Wang, C., Effects of constraint-induced movement therapy in young children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy: An adapted model (2005) Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology, 47 (4), pp. 266-275; Griffiths, M., Video games and health: Video gaming is safe for most players and can be useful in health care (2005) BMJ: British Medical Journal, 331 (7509), p. 122; Hsu, H., Lachenbruch, P.A., Paired t test (2008) Wiley Encyclopedia of Clinical Trials; McDermott, S., Coker, A.L., Mani, S., Krishnaswami, S., Nagle, R.J., Barnett-Queen, L.L., Wuori, D.F., A population-based analysis of behavior problems in children with cerebral palsy (1996) Journal of Pediatric Psychology, 21 (3), pp. 447-463; Miller, F., Bachrach, S.J., Bachrach, S.J., (1995) Cerebral Palsy: A Complete Guide for Caregiving, , Johns Hopkins University Press; Murphy, C.C., Yeargin-Allsopp, M., Decoufle, P., Drews, C.D., Prevalence of cerebral palsy among ten-year-old children in metropolitan atlanta, 1985 through 1987 (1993) The Journal of Pediatrics, 123 (5), pp. S13-S20; Myers, R.H., (1990) Classical and Modern Regression with Applications, 2. , Duxbury Press Belmont, CA; Novak, I., Cusick, A., Lowe, K., A pilot study on the impact of occupational therapy home programming for young children with cerebral palsy (2007) The American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 61 (4), pp. 463-468; Papangelis, A., Mouchakis, G., Boisselle, A., Kosmopoulos, D., Karkaletsis, V., Makedon, F., A game system for remote rehabilitation of cerebral palsy patients (2012) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments, p. 19. , ACM; Parkes, J., White-Koning, M., Dickinson, H.O., Thyen, U., Arnaud, C., Beckung, E., Fauconnier, J., Michelsen, S.I., Psychological problems in children with cerebral palsy: A cross-sectional european study (2008) Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 49 (4), pp. 405-413; Pirila, S., Van Der Meere, J., Korhonen, P., Ruusu-Niemi, P., Kyntaja, M., Nieminen, P., Korpela, R., A retrospective neurocognitive study in children with spastic diplegia (2004) Developmental Neuropsychology, 26 (3), pp. 679-690; Pollner, M., (2000) The Self We Live By: Narrative Identity in a Postmodern World, 23, p. 268. , by James A.

However, they pose challenges for training and attaining high levels of interrater reliability between observers. The Behavioral Observation of Students in Schools (BOSS) is a commonly used school-based observation instrument that is well adapted to measure symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the classroom setting. Reliable use of the BOSS for clinical or research purposes requires training to reach reliable standards (kappa ≥ 0.80). The current study conducted training observations in one suburban and one urban elementary school in the Greater Boston area. To enhance interrater reliability and reduce training time, supplemental guidelines, including 30 additional rules to follow, were developed over two consecutive school years. The complete protocol was then used for training in the third school year. To reach sufficient interrater reliability (kappa ≥ 0.80) during training, 45 training observations were required in the first year while, in the third year, only 17 observations were required. High interrater reliability was sustained after training across all three school years, accumulating a total of 1,001 post-training observations. It is estimated that clinicians or researchers following this proposed protocol, who are naive to the BOSS, will require approximately 30 training observations to reach proficient reliability. We believe this protocol will make the BOSS more accessible for clinical and research usage, and the procedures used to obtain high interrater reliability using the BOSS are broadly applicable to a variety of observational measures. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).","Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); Behavior observation; Behavioral Observation of Students in Schools (BOSS); Classroom observation; Direct observation codes","(2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), , American Psychiatric Association4th edn., Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association; Atkins, M.S., Pelham, W.E., School-based assessment of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (1991) Journal of Learning Disabilities, 24, pp. 197-205. , doi:10.1177/002221949102400403; DuPaul, G.J., Stoner, G., (1994) ADHD in the Schools: Assessment and Intervention Strategies, , New York: Guilford Press; DuPaul, G.J., Anastopoulos, A.D., Shelton, T.L., Guevremont, D.C., Metevia, L., Multimethod assessment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: The diagnostic utility of clinic-based tests (1992) Journal of Clinical Child Psychology (Now Called Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology), 21 (4), pp. 394-402. , doi:10.1207/s15374424jccp2104_10; DuPaul, G.J., Volpe, R.J., Jitendra, A.K., Lutz, J.G., Lorah, K.S., Gruber, R., Elementary school students with AD/HD: Predictors for academia achievement (2004) Journal of School Psychology, 42, pp. 285-301; Gelfand, D.M., Hartmann, D.P., (1975) Child Behavior Analysis and Therapy, , New York: Pergamon Press; Hartman, C.A., Rhee, S.H., Wilcutt, E.G., Pennington, B.F., Modeling rater disagreement for ADHD: Are parents or teachers biased?

Although increased MDA has been previously shown in adults with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (A-ADHD), levels of paraoxonase and arylesterase enzymes have not been studied yet. We aimed to determine the status of both MDA level and paraoxonase and arylesterase enzyme activities in A-ADHD patients. A total of 35 adults with ADHD diagnosis according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria and 29 healthy volunteers were included in the study. Serum MDA, paraoxonase and arylesterase levels of the participants were measured. The disease severity of the patients was determined by using Turgay's Adult Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD/ADHD) DSM IV Based Diagnostic Screening and Rating Scale. The serum MDA level of patients was significantly higher than that of healthy control subjects, whereas their paraoxonase and arylesterase levels were significantly lower. There was no correlation between the levels of biochemical parameters (MDA, paraoxonase and arylesterase) and the disease severity. Sub-types of A-ADHD were similar in terms of these biochemical parameters. Increased lipid peroxidation, a part of oxidative stress, in adults with ADHD appears to be unbuffered by antioxidant enzymes, namely paraoxonase and arylesterase. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Adult ADHD; Arylesterase; Lipid peroxidation; Malondialdehyde; Oxidative stress; Paraoxonase","Akyol, O., Herken, H., Uz, E., Fadillioglu, E., Unal, S., Sogut, S., Ozyurt, H., Savas, H.A., The indices of endogenous oxidative and antioxidative processes in plasma from schizophrenic patients.

Combining psychotropic drugs leads to possible increases in benefits, but also in risks, particularly given the potential for psychotropic drug interactions. Despite the increasing use of concomitant therapy in children and adolescents, there is very little evidence from controlled clinical trials to provide guidance for prescribers. Even while acknowledging the small evidence base, clinical practice guidelines from eminent medical organizations are either relatively silent on or tend to support the use of concomitant treatments more enthusiastically than the evidence would warrant, so that practice and guidance are running ahead of the science. Our narrative review shows that the published evidence for efficacy and safety of concomitant psychotropic drugs in children and adolescents is scanty. A comprehensive search located 37 studies published over the last decade, of which 18 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). These focused mainly on stimulants, central sympatholytics (such as clonidine), antipsychotics and 'mood stabilizers'. While several small, often methodologically weak, RCTs demonstrated statistically significant advantages for dual pharmacotherapy over monotherapy, only adding central sympatholytics to stimulants for treating attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms was supported by substantial studies with an effect size large enough to suggest clinical importance. Non-randomized studies tended to have results that supported concomitant treatment, but all have design-related problems that decrease the reliability of the results. Two studies that specifically examined tolerability of combination pharmacotherapy compared with monotherapy showed significant increases in adverse effects, both subjective and objective, and other studies confirmed a statistically significant increase in adverse effects, including sedation and self-harm. Given the extent of combination therapy occurring, particularly in conditions such as ADHD, and the ambiguous evidence for benefit with clear evidence of harm, we propose that further research should be carried out as a matter of urgency. Until such a time, the attitude to combination pharmacotherapy should be conservative, and combining psychotropic medications should be considered as an 'n of 1' trial to be closely monitored. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,"Salazar, J.A., Poon, I., Nair, M., Clinical consequences of polypharmacy in elderly: Expect the unexpected, think the unthinkable (2007) Expert Opin Drug Saf, 6 (6), pp. 695-704. , 17967158 10.1517/14740338.6.6.695; Comer, J.S., Olfson, M., Mojtabai, R., National trends in child and adolescent psychotropic polypharmacy in office-based practice, 1996-2007 (2010) J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 49, pp. 1001-1010. , 20855045 10.1016/j.jaac.2010.07.007; Goodwin, G., Fleischhacker, W., Arango, C., Advantages and disadvantages of combination treatment with antipsychotics (2009) Eur Neuropsychopharmacol, 19 (7), pp. 520-532. , 19411165 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2009.04.003 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXms1KrurY%3D; Joshi, G., Gerogiopoulos, A.M., Combination pharmacotherapy for psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents (2012) Pharmacotherapy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders, , Rosenberg DR, Gershon S (eds) chap. 17. 3rd ed.

It has been revealed that subgroups of patients with ADHD have omega-3 fatty acid defciency. So, the present study was planned to illustrate the efect of omega-3 supplementation, as an add-on to methylphenidate, on ADHD patients. Materials and Methods: In this double-blind RCT, ADHD children without any co morbidity, who had been diagnosed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist in child and adolescent university clinic, participated and were randomly divided into 2 groups. Te experimental group methylphenidate plus omega-3 capsule (2000mg/d), while control group took methylphenidate plus placebo. Severity of ADHD symptoms were assessed by ADHD rating scale at the baseline and after 2, 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Results: 69 patients (experimental = 36, control = 33) aged 7 to 15 participated. A signifcant reduction of both parent's and teacher's ADHD rating scale scores in both groups was observed. Bu t it couldn't show any diference between two groups. Diference score of parent's at baseline was 1.86+- (5/40), Pv 0.262, after 2 weeks -.70+- (4/30), Pv 0.668,4 weeks. 19+- (5/60), Pv 0.902 and 8 weeks. 30+- (4/42), Pv 0.845. Diference score of Teacher's at baseline was -1.56+- (3/45), Pv 0.541, after 2 weeks -.46+- (6/24), Pv 0.888, 4 weeks. 45+- (5/41), 0.868 and 8 weeks. 73+- (4/18), Pv 0.748. Conclusion: Omega-3 did not enhance the therapeutic results of methylphenidate in ADHD patients.","Attention defcit hyperactivity disorder; Methylphenidate; Omega-3","Bussing, R., Diagnostic utility of two commonly used ADHD screening measures among special education students (1998) J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 37, pp. 74-82; Findling, R.L., Dogin, J.W., Psychopharmacology of ADHD in children and adolescents (1998) J Clin Psychiatry, 59 (7), pp. 42-49; Silva, R., Munoz, D., Alpert, M., Carbamazepine use in children and Adolescents with features of ADHD, A meta analysis (1996) J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 35, pp. 352-357; Conners, D.F., Fletcher, K.E., Swanson, J.W., A meta analysis of clonidine for symptoms of ADHD (1999) J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 38, pp. 1551-1559; Jenson, P., ADHD co morbidity findings from the MTA study: Comparing co morbid subgroups (2000) J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 40, pp. 147-157; Cormier, E., Atention defcit/hyperactivity disorder: A review and update (2008) J Pediatr Nurs, 23, pp. 345-357; Quintero, J., Rodríguez-Quirós, J., Correas-Laufer, J., Pérez-Templado, J., Nutritional aspects of atention-defcit/hyperactive disorder (2009) Rev Neurol, 49, pp. 307-312; Kalmin, S., Launer, L., Ot, A., Witeman, J.C., Hofman, A., Breteler, M.M., Dietary fat intake and the risk of incident dementia in the roterdam study (1997) Ann Neurol, 42, pp. 776-782; Appleton, K.M., Woodside, J.V., Yarnell, J.W., Arveiler, D., Haas, B., Amouyel, P., Depressed mood and dietary fish intake: Direct relationship or indirect relationship as a result of diet and lifestyle?

Participants were derived from case-control family studies of boys and girls diagnosed with ADHD, a genetic linkage study of families with children with ADHD, and a family genetic study of pediatric bipolar disorder. Caucasian children 18 and younger with and without ADHD and with available genetic data were included in this analysis (N=591). The association of genetic risk severity with sociodemographic, clinical characteristics, neuropsychological, emotional, and behavioral correlates was examined in the entire sample, in the sample with ADHD, and in the sample without ADHD, respectively. Greater genetic risk severity was significantly associated with the presence of disruptive behavior disorders in the entire sample and oppositional defiant disorder in participants with ADHD. Greater genetic risk severity was also associated with the absence of anxiety disorders, specifically with the absence of agoraphobia in the context of ADHD. Additionally, one ADHD symptom was significantly associated with greater genetic risk severity. Genetic risk severity is significantly associated with ADHD clinical characteristics and co-morbid disorders, and the nature of these associations may vary on the type (externalizing vs. internalizing) of the disorder. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Attention deficit disorder (ADD); Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); DRD4, DAT1, SERT, 5-HTTLPR; Genetic risk alleles; Genetic risk severity","(2000) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , American Psychiatric Association. 4th edition-text revision (DSM-IV-TR).

Additionally, ADHD in children and adolescents is frequently associated with psychiatric comorbidities. This review provides an overview of the epidemiology, neurobiology, genetics, diagnosis and most recent pharmacological approaches for treatment with a focus on safety and efficacy and describes the use of medications used to treat ADHD in special populations. Areas covered: PubMed, Cochrane database, Essential Evidence and Uptodate were searched for relevant articles about stimulant and non-stimulant pharmacological approaches in ADHD. Expert opinion: Data supporting the safety and efficacy of both stimulant and non-stimulant formulations have significantly grown over the past decade and more efforts are being made to tailor medications to the needs of the patients and their families. Pharmacogenomics research is evolving, but predictors of treatment response and side effects remain largely unknown. Other unmet clinical needs include long-term follow-up studies of the safety and efficacy of medications for those with ADHD alone, or with comorbidities and in special populations including preschoolers. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.","ADHD; Non-stimulants; Stimulants; Treatment","(2000) Diagnostic And Statistical Manual Of Mental Disorders: DSM-IV-TR., , American Psychiatric Association American Psychiatric Association, Washington DC; Larson, K., Russ, S.A., Kahn, R.S., Patterns of comorbidity, functioning, and service use for US children with ADHD, 2007 (2011) Pediatrics, 127, pp. 462-470; Bird, H., (2002) Diagnostic Classification Epidemiology And Cross-cultural Validity Of ADHD, , In: Jensen PS Cooper JR.

Methods In this case-control study, ADD/ADHD children diagnosed according to criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV-TR), along with age-matched controls, were examined at the ADD clinic at the Sheba Medical Center. For children in both groups the following data were recorded: uncorrected visual acuity for distance and near, cycloplegic refraction, ocular motility, and binocular function. Results A total of 56 children (12 girls; mean subject age, 9.5 years) were included in the ADD/ADHD group. The control group comprised 66 patients (29 girls; mean subject age, 9 years). Mean uncorrected visual acuity was nearly 20/20 for distance and J1 for near in both groups. Cycloplegic spherical equivalent was +0.89 ± 1.1 D for the control group and +0.63 ± 0.89 D for the ADD/ADHD group (P = 0.16). Binocular function and accommodation were similar in both groups, except for a significant difference between the near point of convergence of the controls versus the ADD/ADHD group (5.3 ± 2.3 cm versus 4.1 ± 1.8 cm, respectively; P = 0.002). Conclusions ADD/ADHD children had similar visual acuity at distance and near and refractive errors as normal subjects. Binocular function and accommodation were also found to be similar in both groups and thus might not contribute to ADD/ADHD.

Acute and chronic drug abuse, drug dependency and drug withdrawal result in significant alteration of the electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG biofeedback has been used in the treatment of alcohol and mixed substance abuse in residential inpatient populations. More recent outpatient approaches have used quantitative EEG (qEEG) guided neurofeedback, neurofeedback (NFB) integrated with motivational interviewing and LORETA neurofeedback. A recent review of the state-of-art of qEEG and NFB in SUD and earlier reviews have detailed the efficacy ratings and clinical uses of NFB for SUD. In these reviews NFB is rated ""probably efficacious"" as an add-on (adjunct) treatment to other therapies, namely 12-step programs and/or cognitive behavioral therapies, or other types of psychotherapies or residential programs. Neurofeedback is not yet validated as a stand-alone therapy for addictive disorders and cannot yet be considered a mainstream therapy for addiction. Many persons with SUD have comorbid conditions that need to be considered in designing a treatment plan that incorporates neurofeedback. These include mental conditions such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder that may require separate neurofeedback treatment for those specific conditions either preceding neurofeedback treatment for addiction, or incorporated into it. This approach may require separate assessments during the course of therapy to determine response and the need to change protocols or seek other treatments, i.e., medication or psychotherapy, to integrate into the treatment plan update. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: Participants were youth with (n = 242) and without (n = 227) ADHD and controls without ADHD in whom a diagnosis of autism was exclusionary. Assessment included measures of psychiatric, psychosocial, educational, and cognitive functioning. ATs were operationalized by using the withdrawn + social + thought problems T scores from the Child Behavior Checklist. RESULTS: A positive AT profile was significantly overrepresented among ADHD children versus controls (18% vs 0.87%; P <.001). ADHD children with the AT profile were significantly more impaired than control subjects in psychopathology, interpersonal, school, family, and cognitive domains. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial minority of ADHD children manifests ATs, and those exhibiting ATs have greater severity of illness and dysfunction.

METHODS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial in which we compared diagnosis and management of ADHD in 6-to 12-year-olds after implementation of a computer decision support system in 4 practices. RESULTS: Eighty-four charts were reviewed. In the control group, the use of structured diagnostic assessments dropped from 50% in the baseline period to 38% in the intervention period. In the intervention group, however, it rose from 60% to 81%. This difference was statistically significant, even after controlling for age, gender, and race (odds ratio of structured diagnostic assessment in intervention group versus control group = 8.0, 95% confidence interval 1.6-40.6). Significant differences were also seen in the number of ADHD core symptoms noted at the time of diagnosis. Our study was not powered to detect changes in care and management, but the percent of patients who had documented medication adjustments, mental health referrals, and visits to mental health specialists were higher in the intervention group than the control. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of a clinical decision support module resulted in higher quality of care with respect to ADHD diagnosis including a prospect for higher quality of ADHD management in children. Future work will examine how to further develop the ADHD module and add support for other chronic conditions.

Data Sources: We searched PubMed and ScienceDirect through the end of calendar year 2011 using the keywords (1) psychostimulants or methylphenidate or amphetamine, and (2) neuroimaging or MRI or fMRI, and (3) ADHD or ADD or attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Study Selection: We included only English language articles with new data from case-control or placebo controlled studies that examined attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) subjects on and off psychostimulants (as well as 5 relevant review articles). Data Extraction: We combined details of study design and medication effects in each imaging modality. Results: We found 29 published studies that met our criteria. These included 6 structural MRI, 20 functional MRI studies, and 3 spectroscopy studies. Methods varied widely in terms of design, analytic technique, and regions of the brain investigated. Despite heterogeneity in methods, however, results were consistent. With only a few exceptions, the data on the effect of therapeutic oral doses of stimulant medication suggest attenuation of structural and functional alterations found in unmedicated ADHD subjects relative to findings in controls. Conclusions: Despite the inherent limitations and heterogeneity of the extant MRI literature, our review suggests that therapeutic oral doses of stimulants decrease alterations in brain structure and function in subjects with ADHD relative to unmedicated subjects and controls. These medication-associated brain effects parallel, and may underlie, the well-established clinical benefits. © Copyright 2013 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.",,"Increasing prevalence of parent-reported attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder among children- United States, 2003 and 2007 (2010) MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 59 (44), pp. 1439-1443. , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PubMed;

However, neurochemical background of such age-related change is yet to be elucidated. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of 16 proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies comprising 270 individuals with ADHD and 235 controls. Standardized mean differences were calculated and used as an effect size. Sensitivity analyses and meta-regression to explore the effect of age on neurochemical abnormality were performed. A random effects model identified a significantly higher-than-normal N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but no significant differences of other metabolites in that area. No significant difference in metabolite levels was demonstrated in any other region. Sensitivity analysis of children with ADHD revealed significantly higher-than-normal NAA, whereas no significant difference was found in adults with ADHD. Meta-regression revealed significant correlation between advanced age and normal levels of NAA in the mPFC, suggesting that age-dependent abnormality of NAA level in the mPFC is a potential neural basis of age-related change of symptoms of ADHD. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","ADD; ADHD; Attention deficit disorder; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Methylphenidate; MRS","Aoki, Y., Abe, O., Yahata, N., Kuwabara, H., Natsubori, T., Iwashiro, N., Takano, Y., Yamasue, H., Absence of age-related prefrontal NAA change in adults with autism spectrum disorders (2012) Transl.

The aim of this study was to investigate which factors predict work participation, finding work as well as maintaining employment, of young adults with ASD as well as ADD. We obtained data on 563 individuals with ASD and/or ADD, aged 15-27 years. The follow-up period ranged from 1.25 to 2.75 years. Being male (for ADD), living independently (for ASD), expecting to be able to work fulltime (for ASD and ADD), high perceived support from parents and perceived positive attitude of parents regarding work (for ASD and ADD) and perceived positive attitude of social environment (for ADD) predicted finding work by the young adult, while being male (for ADD) and higher age (for ASD and ADD) and positive attitude of social environment regarding work (for ASD) predicted maintaining employment. Both personal and social factors predict work outcome and should be taken into account when supporting individuals with DD in their transition to work. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","ADHD; Autism spectrum disorder;

The present studies applied the prototype-willingness model (Gibbons, Gerrard & Lane, 2003) to academic-based NPS use and examined the impact of academic versus health information on university students' NPS use cognitions. Design and Methods Study 1 used the prototype-willingness model to examine cognitions associated with academic-based willingness to use NPS. In Study 2, participants were randomly assigned to a control condition or to read information on the negative academic or negative health effects of NPS use. Beliefs, willingness, and expectation of engaging in future NPS use, prototypes of users, and perceived vulnerability were assessed. Results Students without a prescription for stimulants or a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) participated in each study (Ns = 555; 166). Twenty to thirty per cent reported NPS use, primarily for academic reasons. Controlling for past NPS, alcohol, and marijuana use: friends' NPS use, prototypes, perceived vulnerability, and negative health and positive academic beliefs were associated with willingness to use NPS in Study 1. Study 2 demonstrated that participants in the academic-information condition reported the lowest willingness and expectations as well as the least favourable prototypes of NPS users. Participants in the health-information condition reported the highest perceived vulnerability. Conclusions These studies highlight: the utility of using a health model framework to examine NPS cognitions, the importance of examining beliefs about the behaviour, and the potential for academic and health information to reduce risky NPS use cognitions. Statement of contribution What is already known? Nonmedical prescription stimulant (NPS) use is a common health-risk behaviour among college students. The most common reasons cited by students for NPS use are related to academics (e.g., increase concentration, stay awake to study). What does this study add? Shows the utility of the prototype-willingness model to examine NPS use cognitions. Experimentally demonstrates the positive impact of academic and health information on NPS use cognitions. Reveals new relationships among health cognitions (including academic and health beliefs) that predict behaviour and are targets for future interventions. © 2012 The British Psychological Society.",,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , Newbury Park, London: Sage; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 179-211. , doi: 10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T; Arria, A.M., Nonmedical use of prescription stimulants and analgesics: Associations with social and academic behaviors among university students (2008) Pharmacotherapy, 28, pp. 156-169. , doi:10.15921phco.28.2.156; Arria, A.M., Caldeira, K.M., Vincent, K.B., O'Grady, K.E., Wish, E.D., Perceived harmfulness predicts nonmedical use of prescription drugs among university students: Interactions with sensation-seeking (2008) Prevention Science, 9, pp. 191-201. , doi: 10.1007/s11121-008-0095-8; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182. , doi: 10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1173; Boyd, C.J., McCabe, S.E., Cranford, J.A., Young, A., Adolescent's motivations to abuse prescription medications (2006) Pediatrics, 118, pp. 2472-2480. , doi: 10.1542/peds.2006-1644; Brody, G.H., Murry, V.M., Gerrard, M., Gibbons, F.X., Molgaard, V., McNair, L., Neubaum-Carlan, E., The strong African American families program: Translating research into prevention programming (2004) Child Development, 75, pp. 900-917; Cohen, J., A power primer (1992) Psychological Bulletin, 112, pp. 155-159. , doi: 10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.155; Courtenay, W.H., McCreary, D.R., Merighi, J.R., Gender and ethnic differences in health beliefs and behaviors (2002) Journal of Health Psychology, 7, pp. 219-231. , doi: 10.1177/1359105302007003216; Desantis, A.D., Webb, E.M., Noar, S.M., Illicit use of prescription ADHD medications on a university campus: A multimethodological approach (2008) Journal of American College Health, 57, pp. 315-323. , doi: 10.3200/JACH.57.3.315-324; (2010), http://www.justice.gov/dea/pubs/csa/812.htm#a, Drug Enforcement Administration.

Yet, it remains unclear whether anxiety disorders add to the SWM impairments evident in ADHD-CT and whether these findings extend into adolescents with ADHD-CT and anxiety. Further, it is not yet known whether children and adolescents with carefully defined anxiety disorders alone, demonstrate SWM deficits. This study explored the association of SWM and its strategy and spatial span components in carefully defined children and adolescents (age 6-16 years) with ADHD-CT alone (N = 163; 14 % female), ADHD-CT and anxiety (N = 243; 23 % female), anxiety disorders alone (N = 69; 25 % female) compared to age- and gender-matched healthy control participants (N = 116; 19 % female). The relationship between SWM and its strategy and span components and core ADHD-CT symptoms and anxiety symptoms were also examined. There was no evidence of an additive effect of ADHD and anxiety on SWM, strategy and spatial span deficits. But, anxiety disorders alone were associated with impaired SWM and span performance compared to healthy control participants. In contrast, strategy did not differ between children and adolescents with anxiety disorders alone and healthy control participants, suggesting that with anxiety span is the most affected component. Further, these findings were age-independent. This study concurs with and extends current influential models about the cognitive effects of anxiety on performance in the setting of ADHD-CT. Clinical implications and future research directions are discussed. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","ADHD combined type; Anxiety; Children/adolescents; Spatial working memory","Achenbach, T.M., (1991) Manual for the Child Behavior Checklist / 4-18 and 1991 Profile, , University of Vermont, Department of Psychiatry Burlington; (2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association 4th ed.; Text Revision.

However, the aetiology of their co-occurrence remains poorly understood. This paper provides the first genetically informative, longitudinal analysis of the interaction between traits of ASD and ADHD, and explores their genetic and environmental overlap. Parents of approximately 5000 twin pairs completed questionnaires assessing traits of ASD and ADHD when twins were aged 8 and 12 years. Cross-lagged longitudinal modelling explored their developmental association, enabling a consideration of phenotypic-driven processes. Overlapping aetiological influences on traits at age 12 years were explored using bivariate twin modelling. Traits of ADHD at age 8 years were more strongly predictive of traits of ASD at 12 years than traits of ASD at 8 years were of traits of ADHD at 12 years. Analysis of traits by subscales assessing specific symptom domains suggested that communication difficulties were most strongly associated with traits of ADHD. Bivariate modelling suggested moderate genetic overlap on traits in males (genetic correlation = 0.41), and a modest degree of overlap in females (genetic correlation = 0.23) at age 12 years. Traits of ADHD at age 8 years significantly influence traits of ASD at age 12 years, after controlling for their initial relationship at age 8 years. In particular, early ADHD traits influenced later communication difficulties. These findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of co-occurring traits across development. In addition, these findings add to a growing body of literature suggesting that traits of ASD and ADHD may arise via similar aetiological processes.",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890515939

Method: The three ADHD screeners were administered to 111 college students enrolled in a college Introductory Psychology class, on whom ACT scores and total course performance were also available. As a measure of cognitive ability, the Wonderlic Personnel Test (Wonderlic, Inc., 2000) was also administered. Furthermore, self-report data were available from participants who had been diagnosed with ADHD. The three screeners were the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) (Kessler et al., 2005), the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale-Self-Report: Long Version (CAARS) (Conners, Erhardt, & Sparrow, 1999), and the Brown ADD Scales (Brown, 1996). Results: The results are discussed in terms of the scales' reliability, as well as their relationship to academic aptitude, class performance, and their ability to identify self-reported ADHD diagnoses. Conclusion: All three screeners exhibited acceptable reliability levels. Criterion validity was demonstrated by the relationship between the CAARS's inattention subscale and self-reported cases of ADHD. Criterion validity was also seen in the relationship found between the CAARS's hyperactivity/restlessness subscale and the total course performance even after controlling for cognitive ability. Contrary to past research cognitive ability exhibited a weak but significant relationship with a few screeners and screener subscales. © 2012 SAGE Publications.","ADD/ADHD; college students; psychometrics","(2007) ACT Assessment Technical Manual, , Iowa City, IA: Author; (2010) Why take the ACT?, , http://www.actstudent.org/faq/answers/why.html, ACT, Retrieved from; (1999), http://www2.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/finrule/1999-1/031299c.pdf, Assistance to States for Education of Children With Disabilities and Early Intervention Program for Infants and Toddlers With Disabilities; Final Regulations, 64 CFR § 300, Retrieved from(1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , (4th ed.).

Method: Participants were 271 youths with ADHD and 230 controls without ADHD of both sexes along with their siblings. Participants completed a large battery of measures designed to assess psychiatric comorbidity, psychosocial, educational, and cognitive parameters. Results: Post-traumatic stress disorder was significantly higher in ADHD probands vs. controls (5.2% vs. 1.7%, χ2 (1)=4.36, P=0.04). Irrespective of the comorbidity with PTSD, ADHD subjects had similar ages at onset of ADHD, similar type and mean number of ADHD symptoms, and similar ADHD-associated impairments. PTSD in ADHD probands was significantly associated with a higher risk of psychiatric hospitalization, school impairment, poorer social functioning and higher prevalences of mood, conduct disorder, and anxiety disorders. The mean onset of PTSD (12.6years) was significantly later than that of ADHD and comorbid disorders (all P&lt;0.05). Siblings of ADHD and ADHD+PTSD probands had higher prevalences of ADHD vs. siblings of controls (35% vs. 18%, z=4.00, P&lt;0.001 and 67% vs. 18%, z=4.02, P&lt;0.001 respectively) and siblings of ADHD+PTSD probands had a significantly higher prevalence of PTSD compared with the siblings of ADHD and control probands (20% vs. 3% and 3%, z=2.99, P=0.003 and z=2.07, P=0.04 respectively). Conclusion: Findings indicate that the comorbidity with PTSD in ADHD leads to greater clinical severity as regards psychiatric comorbidity and psychosocial dysfunction. ADHD is equally familial in the presence of PTSD in the proband indicating that their co-occurrence is not owing to diagnostic error. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

Stimulant medication is frequently used in management, with significant adverse effects. There is a growing interest in complementary treatments like yoga. Aims: To study the effects of yoga as a complementary therapy in children with moderate to severe ADHD. Settings and Design: The study was performed on children (consent was taken from parents) admitted in a child psychiatry unit using an open-label exploratory study. Materials and Methods: Children between 5 and 16 years of age diagnosed with ADHD and co-operative for yoga were included. Subjects with other serious psychiatric and medical illnesses were excluded. The participants were given yoga training daily during their in-patient stay. They were rated on Conners′ abbreviated rating scale - (CARS), ADHD-rating scale-IV (ADHD - RS IV) and clinical global impression (CGI)-Severity, at the beginning of study, at discharge and subsequently at the end of 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd month by a research associate not involved in yoga instruction. Paired t-test was employed to compare the means of scores between baseline and follow-ups. Results: A total of 9 children (8 males, 1 female) were recruited into the study. All, but one were on medications. An average of 8 yoga training sessions was given to subjects. They were able to learn yoga reasonably well. There was a significant improvement in the ADHD symptoms as assessed on CARS (P-0.014), ADHD-RS IV (P=0.021) and CGI- S scales (P=0.004) at the time of discharge.","Attention deficithyperactivity disorder; children; inpatients; yoga","Faraone, S.V., Sergeant, J., Gillberg, C., Biederman, J., The worldwide prevalence of ADHD: Is it an American condition?

The possible relationship between BMD and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in all age groups has been attracting more attention of researchers due to highly overlapping symptoms such as excessive talking, attention deficit, and increased motor activity. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of ADHD comorbidity in BMD patients and the clinical features of these patients. Methods Of 142 patients, who presented to the Bipolar Disorder Unit of Zonguldak Karaelmas University Research and Application Hospital between the dates of August 1, 2008 and June 31, 2009 and diagnosed with BMD according to DSM-IV criteria consecutively, 118 patients signed informed consent and 90 of them completed the study. They all were in euthymic phase during the study evaluations. A sociodemographical data form, Wender-Utah Rating Scale (WURS), ADD/ADHD Diagnostic and Evaluation Inventory for Adults, and Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, Clinical Version (SCID-I) were applied to all participating patients. Results A total of 23.3% of all patients met the criteria for A-ADHD diagnosis along BMD. No difference was detected regarding sociodemographical features between the BMD + A-ADHD and the BMD without A-ADHD groups. The BMD + A-ADHD group had at least one extra educational year repetition than the other group and the difference was statistically significant. The BMD starting age in the BMD + A-ADHD group was significantly earlier (p = 0.044) and the number of manic episodes was more frequent in the BMD + A-ADHD group (p = 0.026) than the BMD without ADHD group. Panic disorder in the BMD + A-ADHD group (p = 0.019) and obsessive-compulsive disorder in the BMD + C-ADHD group (p = 0.001) were most frequent comorbidities. Conclusions A-ADHD is a frequent comorbidity in BMD. It is associated with early starting age of BMD, higher number of manic episodes during the course of BMD, and more comorbid Axis I diagnoses. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,"Weissman, M.M., Bland, R.C., Canino, G.J., Faravelli, C., Greenwald, S., Hwu, H.G., Cross-national epidemiology of major depression and bipolar disorder (1996) JAMA, 276, pp. 293-299; Bebbington, P., Ramana, R., The epidemiology of bipolar disorder (1995) Sos Psychiatry Epidemiol, 30, pp. 279-292; Akiskal, H.S., Bourgeois, M.L., Angst, J., Post, R., Moller, H., Hirshfeld, R., Reevaluating the prevalence of and diagnostic composition within the broad clinical spectrum of bipolar disorders (2000) J Affect Disord, 59, pp. 5-30; Akiskal, H.S., The bipolar spectrum: Research and clinical perspectives (1995) Encéphale, 21, pp. 3-11; McElroy, S.L., Altshuler, L.L., Suppes, T., Keck Jr., P.E., Frye, M.A., Denicoff, K.D., Axis i psychiatric comorbidity and its relationship to historical illness variables in 288 patients with bipolar disorder (2001) Am J Psychiatry, 158, pp. 420-426; Vieta, E., Colom, F., Corbella, B., Martinez-Aran, A., Reinares, M., Benabarre, A., Clinical correlates of psychiatric comorbidity in bipolar i patients (2001) Bipolar Disord, 3, pp. 253-258; Sasson, Y., Chopra, M., Harrari, E., Amitai, K., Zohar, J., Bipolar comorbidity: From diagnostic dilemmas to therapeutic challenge (2003) Int J Neuropsychopharmacol, 6, pp. 139-144; Sachs, G.S., Baldassano, C., Comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with early and late onset bipolar disorder (2000) Am J Psychiatry, 157, pp. 466-468; West, S.A., McElroy, S.L., Strakowski, S.M., Keck Jr., P.E., McConville, B.J., Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adolescent mania (1995) Am J Psychiatry, 152, pp. 271-273; Winokur, G., Coryell, W., Endicott, J., Akiskal, H., Further distinctions between manic-depressive illness [bipolar disorder] and primary depressive disorder [unipolar depression] (1993) Am J Psychiatry, 150, pp. 1176-1181; Geller, B., Williams, M., Zimerman, B., Frazier, J., Beringer, L., Warner, K.L., Prepubertal and early adolescent bipolarity differentiate from ADHD by manic symptoms, grandiose delusions, ultra-rapid or ultradian cycling (1998) J Affect Disord, 51, pp. 81-91; Wozniak, J., Biederman, J., Kiely, K., Ablon, J.S., Faraone, S.V., Mundy, E., Mania-like symptoms suggestive of childhood-onset bipolar disorder in clinically referred children (1995) J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 34, pp. 867-876; Masi, G., Perugi, G., Toni, C., Millepiedi, S., Mucci, M., Bertini, N., Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder bipolar comorbidity in children and adolescents (2006) Bipolar Disord, 8, pp. 373-381; Tamam, L., Karakus, G., Ozpoyraz, N., Comorbidity of adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder: Prevalence and clinical correlates (2006) Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci, 258, pp. 385-393; Nierenberg, A.A., Miyahara, S., Spencer, T., Wisniewski, S.R., Otto, M.W., Simon, N., Clinical and diagnostic implications of lifetime attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder comorbidity in adults with bipolar disorder: Data from the first 1000 STEP-BD participants (2005) Biol Psychiatry, 57, pp. 1467-1473; Sachs, G.S., Baldassano, C.F., Truman, C.J., Guille, C., Comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with early- and late-onset bipolar disorder (2000) Am J Psychiatry, 157, pp. 466-468; (1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , 4th ed.

The findings of the study reveal that the prevalence of ADHD was estimated to be 11.6%. The subtypes results indicate: a prevalence of 6.3% for ADD, a prevalence of 2.2% for HD. The third type that is the combined hyperactive/ impulsive and inattentive type of ADHD has a prevalence of 3.1%. The results show that there is a difference between ADHD prevalence among elementary school children due to the difference in age.

Beginning with a brief summary of how and why PB goals impact academic outcomes and the relevance of this to students with ADHD, concrete steps to implementing PB goals are described. Following this, the broader concept of academic growth is discussed, along with some guidance as to how to operationalise growth approaches with students. Taken together, a greater focus on academically at-risk students' personal trajectories is suggested as a potentially fruitful approach to enhancing their educational outcomes.

The disorder is characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Alongside these symptoms, it is discussed whether symptoms of emotional dysregulation could add additional and better description of the psychopathology of ADHD. Neither the current ICD-10 and DSM-IV nor the upcoming DSM-5 includes symptoms of emotional dysregulation as a core aspect of ADHD. Several authors (e.g., Wender 1995) describe adult ADHD in a more differentiated way and propose concepts of the disorder that consider the subjective experiences of the adult patient by introducing the symptomatology of emotional symptoms. Empirical studies attest this dimension sufficient reliability and validity. Symptoms of emotional dysregulation are definable and seem to be distinct factors of the psychopathology of adult ADHD. Pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions help to alleviate this type of symptoms. This review attests a decisive role to the emotional symptoms in the ADHD symptomatology, which should be taken in serious consideration by future research. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Wien.","ADHD in adults; ADHD psychopathology; Emotional dysregulation; Wender-Reimherr Adult Attention Disorder Rating Scale","Barkley, R.A., (2006) Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Handbook for Diagnosis and Treatment, , New York: Guilford; Barkley, R.A., Fischer, M., The unique contribution of emotional impulsiveness to impairment in major life activities in hyperactive children as adults (2010) J Am Acad of Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 49, pp. 503-513; Barkley, R.A., Murphy, K.R., Identifying new symptoms for diagnosing ADHD in adulthood (2006) ADHD Rep, 14, pp. 7-11; Barkley, R.A., Murphy, K.R., Deficient emotional self-regulation in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): the relative contributions of emotional impulsiveness and ADHD symptoms to adaptive impairments in major life activities (2010) J ADHD Relat Disord, 4, pp. 5-28; Biederman, J., Mick, E., Faraone, S.V., Age-dependent decline of symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: impact of remission definition and symptom type (2000) Am J Psychiatry, 157, pp. 816-818; Bramham, J., Young, S., Bickerdike, A., Spain, D., McCartan, D., Xenitidis, K., Evaluation of group cognitive behavioral therapy for adults with ADHD (2009) J Atten Disord, 12, pp. 434-441; Brown, T.E., (1996) Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scales, , San Antonio: The Psychological Corporation; Castells, X., Ramos-Quiroga, J.A., Bosch, R., Nogueira, M., Casas, M., Amphetamines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults (2011) Cochrane Database Syst Rev, p. 6; Conners, C.K., Erhard, D., Sparrow, D., (1999) Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS), , New York: Multi-Health Systems; Corbisiero, S., Buchli-Kammermann, J., Stieglitz, R.D., Reliability and validity of the Wender-Reimherr-Interview (WRI).

Previous research has highlighted the importance of examining the factors that influence attitudes toward ADHD. This article examines an understudied factor, religion, and its relationship with ADHD attitudes. Using data from the 2002 General Social Survey National Stigma Study-Children, this research finds that compared to the rest of the population, evangelical Christians are less likely to view ADHD as a real disease and to believe children with ADHD should be treated with medication. Results also demonstrate that evangelicals are more likely to think doctors are overmedicating children with common behavior problems and to think medication prevents families from working out problems themselves. On the other hand, church attendance is unrelated to beliefs about ADHD treatment but is positively associated with thinking ADHD is a real disease. These findings add new insights to the existing literature on religion and medicalization. © 2013 The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion.","ADHD; Church attendance; Evangelical; Medicalization","(2000) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fourth edition, text revision, , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association; Angel, R., Thoits, P., The impact of culture on the cognitive structure of illness (1987) Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry, 11 (4), pp. 465-494; Ariès, P., (1962) Centuries of childhood, , New York: Knopf; Barker, K.K., Electronic support groups, patient-consumers, and medicalization: The case of contested illness (2008) Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 49 (1), pp. 20-36; Barkley, R.A., (2006) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: A handbook for diagnosis and treatment, , 3rd ed.

Methods: We administered Brown ADD Scales to two samples at risk for attention deficithyperactivity disorder (ADHD): one of acute psychiatric inpatients (N.=56) and the other of affected children' parents (N.=28). We got through to people positive to screening in order to confirm the diagnosis. Results: Data obtained seem to suggest a low reliability of Brown ADD Scales self-scoring in populace at risk. Conclusion: The results obtained indicate the call for developing more sensitive diagnostic instruments targeted on ""particular"" populaces. It is confirmed the importance of self history and family/close friends records. Generally speaking, it is also confirmed adult ADHD diagnosis as problematic and the need of further and wider researchers.","Attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity; Eating disorders; Sensitivity and specificity; Substance-related disorders","Barkley, R.A., Fisher, M., Smallish, L., Fletcher, K., The persistence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder into young adulthood as a function of reporting source and definition of disorder (2002) J Abnorm Child Psychol, 111, pp. 279-289; Barkley, R.A., Major life activity and health outcomes associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (2002) J Clin Psychiatry, 63, pp. 10-15; Biederman, J., Faraone, S.V., Spencer, T., Wilens, T., Norman, D., Lapey, K.A., Patterns of psychiatric comorbidity, cognition and psychosocial functioning in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (1993) Am J Psychiatry, 150, pp. 1792-1798; Fayyad, J., De Graaf, R., Kessler, R., Alonso, J., Angermeyer, M., Demyttenaere, K., Cross-national prevalence and correlates of adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (2007) Br J Psychiatry, 190, pp. 402-409; Kessler, R.C., Adler, L., Ames, M., Barkley, R.A., Birnbaum, H., Greenberg, P., The prevalence and effects of adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder on work performance in a nationally representative sample of workers (2005) J Occup Environ Med, 47, pp. 565-572; Alpert, J.E., Maddocks, A., Nierenberg, A.A., O'Sullivan, R., Pava, J.A., Worthington III, J.J., Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in childhood among adults with major depression (1996) Psychiatry Res, 62, pp. 213-219; Fones, C.S., Pollack, M.H., Susswein, L., Otto, M., History of childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) features among adults with panic disorder (2000) J Affect Disord, 58, pp. 99-106; Faraone, S.V., Biederman, J., Feighner, J.A., Monuteaux, M.C., Assessing symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adults: Which is more valid?

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between polymorphisms in the α-2A-adrenergic receptor (ADRA2A) and norepinephrine transporter (SLC6A2) genes and attentional performance in ADHD children before and after pharmacological treatment.One hundred one medication-naive ADHD children were included. All subjects were administered methylphenidate (MPH)-OROS for 12 weeks. The subjects underwent a computerized comprehensive attention test to measure the response time variability at baseline before MPH treatment and after 12 weeks. Additive regression analyses controlling for ADHD symptom severity, age, sex, IQ, and final dose of MPH examined the association between response time variability on the comprehensive attention test measures and allelic variations in single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the ADRA2A and SLC6A2 before and after MPH treatment.Increasing possession of an A allele at the G1287A polymorphism of SLC6A2 was significantly related to heightened response time variability at baseline in the sustained (P = 2.0 × 10) and auditory selective attention (P = 1.0 × 10) tasks. Response time variability at baseline increased additively with possession of the T allele at the DraI polymorphism of the ADRA2A gene in the auditory selective attention task (P = 2.0 × 10). After medication, increasing possession of a G allele at the MspI polymorphism of the ADRA2A gene was associated with increased MPH-related change in response time variability in the flanker task (P = 1.0 × 10).Our study suggested an association between norepinephrine gene variants and response time variability measured at baseline and after MPH treatment in children with ADHD. Our results add to a growing body of evidence, suggesting that response time variability is a viable endophenotype for ADHD and suggesting its utility as a surrogate end point for measuring stimulant response in pharmacogenetic studies.

While previous research points to socialization processes as a way to explain the gender gap, the current study investigates whether there are genetic differences in self-control that are operating across the sexes in adolescence and adulthood. First, the results revealed that the same genetic factors influence levels of self-control in males and females. This implies that the genetic influences on self-control are not gender-specific. Second, the results also revealed that the magnitude of the genetic effects on self-control is the same across the sexes. These findings are aligned with other studies that have found no significant sex differences in the genetic effects on constructs related to low self-control, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other self-regulatory problems. The implications of these findings for Gottfredson and Hirschi's theory are discussed. © 2013 Copyright Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.","Add Health; behavioral genetics; gender; Gottfredson and Hirschi;

Method: A literature search of several databases (Medline, Psychinfo, CINAHL, PsycARTICLES) was conducted with the search terms: 'memantine' with limits: English language, Human trials, all child (aged 0-18 years). The search was later expanded to include 'Adults' and relevant articles were also selected from reference lists. Result: The search did not find any well-controlled studies in children and adolescents except for open label trials, as monotherapy in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as an augmenting agent in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). No study was found in anxiety disorders (AD), the most common psychiatric disorder in children or in mood disorders, both major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). Studies in adults for those disorders with onset in childhood or adolescence, were also mostly open-label and as an add-on therapy. All the studies reported that memantine is a safe drug with minimal drug interactions and a very acceptable adverse effect profile comparable to placebo. Conclusion: Memantine has demonstrated beneficial effects in some childhood disorders but the evidence is too limited at present and does not provide enough support of its efficacy to advocate for its regular use in those conditions. Such use remains off-label until further validation of efficacy comes from blinded, randomized, placebo controlled studies.","Adolescents; Children; Glutamatergic system; Memantine; Nmda receptor antagonist;

We also identified a possible role of the dopaminergic system in this effect, because visual contrast perception depends on dopaminergic neurotransmission. Dopamine is also known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Therefore, in order to explore the specificity of retinal contrast gain as a marker of depression in comparison with other psychiatric diseases, we recorded the pattern electroretinogram (PERG) in patients with ADHD. Twenty patients diagnosed with ADHD and 20 matched healthy subjects were studied. Visual pattern electroretinograms were recorded from both eyes. The contrast gain of the patients with attention deficit disorder (ADD) did not differ from the control group, nor did the contrast gain of any ADHD subgroup (predominantly inattentive or combined patients). In the healthy subjects, a significant correlation between depression score and contrast gain was found. As the contrast gain in an earlier study clearly separated the patients with depression from the controls, we assume that retinal contrast gain might be a specific marker in depression. © 2013 Bubl et al.",,"Speck, L.B., Dim, B., Mercer, M., Visual evoked responses of psychiatric patients (1966) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 15, pp. 59-63; Normann, C., Schmitz, D., Fürmaier, A., Döing, C., Bach, M., Long-term plasticity of visually evoked potentials in humans is altered in major depression (2007) Biol Psychiatry, 62, pp. 373-380; Lavoie, M.-P., Lam, R.W., Bouchard, G., Sasseville, A., Charron, M.-C., Evidence of a biological effect of light therapy on the retina of patients with seasonal affective disorder (2009) Biol.

Method: A comprehensive examination of the literature was conducted on children with ADHD with and without co-occurring disabilities, summarizing their reading and math achievement and the effects of psychostimulant and sensory stimulant interventions on these academic areas. Results: Students without co-occurring disabilities (ADHD-) had fewer deficits in reading than in math and than students with co-occurring disabilities (ADHD+). Furthermore, students with ADHD+ demonstrated greater responsiveness to psychostimulants through improved reading recognition and math calculations, with limited gains in literal reading comprehension. Added sensory stimulation produced differential gains for both groups in reading recognition and comprehension and in math calculations and problem solving. Conclusion: The efficacy of psychostimulants was documented on specific areas of achievement for the ADHD+ group, but this review did not support the administration of psychostimulants for students with ADHD-.

The authors compared executive functions and microstructural integrity of the frontostriatal circuit in children with ADHD and typically developing children. Method We assessed 25 children with ADHD and 25 age-, sex-, handedness-and intelligence-matched typically developing children by using psychiatric interviews, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-third edition, and the tasks involving executive functions in the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. The frontostriatal tracts were reconstructed by diffusion spectrum imaging tractography and were subdivided into four functionally distinct segments, including dorsolateral, medial prefrontal, orbitofrontal and ventrolateral tracts. Tract-specific and matched case-control analyses were used and generalized fractional anisotropy values were computed. Results Children with ADHD had lower generalized fractional anisotropy of all the bilateral frontostriatal fiber tracts and poorer performance in verbal and spatial working memory, set-shifting, sustained attention, cognitive inhibition and visuospatial planning. The symptom severity of ADHD and the executive functioning performance significantly correlated with integrity of the frontostriatal tracts, particularly the left orbitofrontal and ventrolateral tracts. Children with ADHD also demonstrated loss of the leftward asymmetry in the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal tracts that was present in typically developing children. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate disturbed structural connectivity of the frontostriatal circuitry in children with ADHD and add new evidence of associations between integrity of the frontostriatal tracts and measures of core symptoms of ADHD and a wide range of executive dysfunctions in both groups. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;

After a short summary on phenomenology, clinical course and comorbid conditions we review indications for pharmacological treatment in detail. Unfortunately, standardized and large enough drug trials in TS patients fulfilling evidence based medicine standards are still scarce. Treatment decisions are often guided by individual needs and personal experience of treating clinicians. The present recommendations for pharmacological tic treatment are therefore based on both scientific evidence and expert opinion. As first-line treatment of tics risperidone (best evidence level for atypical antipsychotics) or tiapride (largest clinical experience in Europe and low rate of adverse reactions) are recommended. Aripiprazole (still limited but promising data with low risk for adverse reactions) and pimozide (best evidence of the typical antipsychotics) are agents of second choice. In TS patients with comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) atomoxetine, stimulants or clonidine should be considered, or, if tics are severe, a combination of stimulants and risperidone. When mild to moderate tics are associated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depression or anxiety sulpiride monotherapy can be helpful. In more severe cases the combination of risperidone and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor should be given. In summary, further studies, particularly randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials including larger and/or more homogenous patient groups over longer periods are urgently needed to enhance the scientific basis for drug treatment in tic disorders.

Results from linear probability and logistic regression models using data from 6145 survey respondents indicate that youths who reported symptoms consistent with Hyperactive-Impulsive type ADHD in childhood were significantly more likely than other youths to report clinical characteristics of disordered gambling, large past-year losses and/or multiple forms of gambling as young adults. The Combined type ADHD had no significant relationship to the gambling indicators, while the Inattentive type ADHD symptoms have a significant negative relationship to the gambling indicators. These findings provide preliminary support in a large, nationally representative sample for the relationship of ADHD and gambling and underscore the importance of addressing gambling-related issues in education, prevention and intervention efforts with youths with ADHD and/or problems with impulse control. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","ADHD; adolescents; gambling; health; young adults","Alessi, S.M., Petry, N.M., Pathological gambling is associated with impulsivity in a delay discounting procedure (2003) Behavioural Processes, 64, pp. 345-354; (2000) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, 4th ed. text revision, Washington, DC, Washington, DC,: Author; Blaszczynski, A., Nower, L., A pathways model of problem and pathological gambling (2002) Addiction, 97, pp. 487-499; Breyer, J.L., Botzet, A.M., Winters, K.C., Stinchfield, R.D., August, G., Realmuto, G., Young adult gambling behaviors and their relationship with the persistence of ADHD (2009) Journal of Gambling Studies, 25, pp. 227-238; Crone, E.A., Vendel, I., van der Molen, M.W., Decision-making in disinhibited adolescents and adults: Insensitivity to future consequences or driven by immediate reward?

The far lateral location of this cortex in the brain, however, has made it difficult to study with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). We used the smaller voxel sizes of the magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) variant of MRS, acquired at a steep coronal-oblique angle to sample bilateral middle frontal gyrus in 13 children and adolescents with ADHD and 13 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Within a subsample of the ADHD patients, aspects of attention were also assessed with the Trail Making Task. In right middle frontal gyrus only, mean levels of N-acetyl-aspartate + N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (tNAA), creatine + phosphocreatine (Cr), choline-compounds (Cho), and myo-inositol (mI) were significantly lower in the ADHD than in the control sample. In the ADHD patients, lower right middle frontal Cr was associated with worse performance on Trails A and B (focused attention, concentration, set-shifting), while the opposite relationship held true for the control group on Trails B. These findings add to evidence implicating right middle frontal cortex in ADHD. Lower levels of these multiple species may reflect osmotic adjustment to elevated prefrontal cortical perfusion in ADHD and/or a previously hypothesized defect in astrocytic production of lactate in ADHD resulting in decelerated energetic metabolism (Cr), membrane synthesis (Cho, mI), and acetyl-CoA substrate for NAA synthesis. Lower Cr levels may indicate attentional or executive impairments. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Choline compounds; Creatine; Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; Myo-inositol; N-acetyl-aspartate","Amen, D.G., Carmichael, B.D., High-resolution brain SPECT imaging in ADHD (1997) Annals of Clinical Psychiatry, 9, pp. 81-86; (2000) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, Text-Revision, American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC; Aron, A.R., Fletcher, P.C., Bullmore, E.T., Sahakian, B.J., Robbins, T.W., Methylphenidate improves response inhibition in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (2003) Biological Psychiatry, 54, pp. 1465-1468; Barkley, R.A., Grodzinsky, G., Are tests of frontal lobe functions useful in the diagnosis of attention deficit disorders?

Generally the findings of GWAS relying on ADHD status have been non-significant, but the one study using quantitative measures of symptoms found SLC9A9 and SLC6A1 were associated with inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity. Accordingly, we performed a GWAS using quantitative measures of each ADHD subtype measured with the Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD and Normal Behaviour (SWAN) scale in two community-based samples. This scale captures the full range of attention and kinetic behavior; from high levels of attention and appropriate activity to the inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity associated with ADHD within two community-based samples. Our discovery sample comprised 1,851 participants (mean age = 22.8 years [4.8]; 50.6% female), while our replication sample comprised 155 participants (mean age = 26.3 years [3.1]; 68.4% females). Age, sex, age × sex, and age2 were included as covariates and the results from each sample were combined using meta-analysis, then analyzed with a gene-based test to estimate the combined effect of markers within genes. We compare our results with markers that have previously been found to have a strong association with ADHD symptoms. Neither the GWAS nor subsequent meta-analyses yielded genome-wide significant results; the strongest effect was observed at rs2110267 (4.62 × 10-7) for symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity. The strongest effect in the gene-based test was for GPR139 on symptoms of inattention (6.40 × 10-5). Replication of this study with larger samples will add to our understanding of the genetic etiology of ADHD. © The Authors 2013.","ADHD; GWAS; hyperactivity-impulsivity; inattention; meta-analysis; SWAN","Abecasis, G., Willer, C., (2007) Metal: Meta Analysis Helper, , http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/metal/, Accessed on 16 November 2012.

A deficit of attention during the day is observed in children with ADHD/ADD and is commonly associated with poor sleep during the night. Motor disturbances that occur during the night are often associated with increased sleep fragmentation; the association between restless legs syndrome, periodic movements of the inferior limbs and ADHD/ADD is well documented. Abnormal rhythmic movement and parasomnia, associated with non-rapid eye movement sleep, are also common in children with ADHD/ADD. The assessment of ADHD/ADD in children should include systematic evaluation of these motor sleep disturbances in order to provide optimal treatment.","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Restless legs syndrome;

Method: The ASRS-6 was completed by 234 university students and 157 outpatients treated for drug dependence. In both samples, the ASRS-6 was subjected to two confirmatory factor analyses, one testing a one-factor model and the other testing a model with two correlated factors indicating inattentiveness and hyperactivity, respectively. Test-retest reliability of the subscales was tested on a subset of the student sample (n = 25). Results: In both samples, the one-factor solution did not fit the data, but the two-factor solution fit the data better. Subscales differed in their correlates in ways that mirror the correlates of inattentiveness and hyperactivity in the published literature on ADHD. In the student sample, the test-retest reliability was adequate for hyperactivity (r = .70) and inattentiveness (r = .77).

Deregulation of DAT function has been linked to several neurological and psychiatric disorders including ADHD, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and drug addiction. Over the last 15 years, several studies have revealed a plethora of mechanisms influencing the activity and cellular distribution of DAT; suggesting that fine-tuning of dopamine homeostasis occurs via an elaborate interplay of multiple pathways. Here, we show for the first time that the βγ subunits of G proteins regulate DAT activity. In heterologous cells and brain tissue, a physical association between Gβγ subunits and DAT was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, in vitro pull-down assays using purified proteins established that this association occurs via a direct interaction between the intracellular carboxy-terminus of DAT and Gβγ. Functional assays performed in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog GTP-γ-S, Gβγ subunit overexpression, or the Gβγ activator mSIRK all resulted in rapid inhibition of DAT activity in heterologous systems. Gβγ activation by mSIRK also inhibited dopamine uptake in brain synaptosomes and dopamine clearance from mouse striatum as measured by high-speed chronoamperometry in vivo. Gβγ subunits are intracellular signaling molecules that regulate a multitude of physiological processes through interactions with enzymes and ion channels. Our findings add neurotransmitter transporters to the growing list of molecules regulated by G-proteins and suggest a novel role for Gβγ signaling in the control of dopamine homeostasis. © 2013 Garcia-Olivares et al.",,"Gainetdinov, R.R., Sotnikova, T.D., Caron, M.G., Monoamine transporter pharmacology and mutant mice (2002) Trends Pharmacol Sci, 23, pp. 367-373; Jones, S.R., Gainetdinov, R.R., Jaber, M., Giros, B., Wightman, R.M., Profound neuronal plasticity in response to inactivation of the dopamine transporter (1998) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 95, pp. 4029-4034; Zahniser, N.R., Sorkin, A., Rapid regulation of the dopamine transporter: role in stimulant addiction (2004) Neuropharmacology, 47, pp. 80-91; Foster, J.D., Cervinski, M.A., Gorentla, B.K., Vaughan, R.A., Regulation of the dopamine transporter by phosphorylation (2006) Handb Exp Pharmacol, 175, pp. 197-214; Eriksen, J., Jorgensen, T.N., Gether, U., Regulation of dopamine transporter function by protein-protein interactions: new discoveries and methodological challenges (2011) J Neurochem, 113, pp. 27-41; Sager, J.J., Torres, G.E., Proteins interacting with monoamine transporters: current state and future challenges (2011) Biochemistry, 50, pp. 7295-7310; Egaña, L.A., Cuevas, R.A., Baust, T.B., Parra, L.A., Leak, R.K., Physical and functional interaction between the dopamine transporter and the synaptic vesicle protein synaptogyrin-3 (2009) J Neurosci, 29, pp. 4592-4604; Ahnert-Hilger, G., Nurnberg, B., Exner, T., Schafer, T., Jahn, R., The heterotrimeric G protein Go2 regulates catecholamine uptake by secretory vesicles (1998) EMBO J, 17, pp. 406-413; Brunk, I., Blex, C., Rachakonda, S., Holtje, M., Winter, S., The first luminal domain of vesicular monoamine transporters mediates G-protein-dependent regulation of transmitter uptake (2006) J Biol Chem, 281, pp. 33373-33385; Ahnert-Hilger, G., Schafer, T., Spicher, K., Grund, C., Schultz, G., Detection of G-protein heterotrimers on large dense core and small synaptic vesicles of neuroendocrine and neuronal cells (1994) Eur J Cell Biol, 65, pp. 26-28; Carneiro, A.M., Ingram, S.L., Beaulieu, J.M., Sweeney, A., Amara, S.G., The multiple LIM domain-containing adaptor protein Hic-5 synaptically colocalizes and interacts with the dopamine transporter (2002) J Neurosci, 22, pp. 7045-7054; Torres, G.E., Carneiro, A., Seamans, K., Fiorentini, C., Sweeney, A., Oligomerization and trafficking of the human dopamine transporter.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a very heterogeneous neurobiological condition. It is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in the childhood population. Its prevalence is estimated to be 3-6% in school-age children. Aim. To review the characteristics of patients with inattentive subtype ADHD, including those who could be grouped in a more homogenous subtype which the DSM-5 proposes for classification as the restrictive subtype. Development. The characteristic triad of symptoms consists of attention deficit, hyperactivity and impulsivity. The diagnostic criteria are defined in the DSM-IV-TR. For those with deterioration due to ADHD with no significant hyperactivity problems, this manual offers a confusing diagnostic label. Indeed, the neurobiological substrate underlying the diverse subtypes seems to be different in certain aspects, since the frontostriatal circuit appears to be more affected in combined ADHD, while the frontoparietal circuit is more compromised in the inattentive subtype. For these and other reasons, the DSM-5 will reformulate the different subtypes of ADHD and will probably include a new subgroup that will comprise those patients who satisfy at least six inattention criteria and fewer than two criteria for hyperactivity-impulsivity (restrictive ADHD). Conclusions. The definition of this subgroup could make it easier to detect some patients who have so far received little attention from the point of view of both research and clinical practice. © 2013 Revista de Neurología.","ADD; ADHD; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; DSM-5; DSM-IV; Inattention; Restrictive; Slow cognitive pace","Barkley, R.A., Dupaul, G.J., McMurray, M.B., Comprehensive evaluation of attention deficit disorder with and without hyperactivity as defined by research criteria (1990) J Consult Clin Psychol, 58, pp. 775-789; Weiss, G., Hechtman, L., The hyperactive child syndrome (1979) Science, 205, pp. 1348-1354; Caci, H., Bouchez, J., Bayle, F.J., Inattentive symptoms of ADHD are related to evening orientation (2009) J Atten Disord, 13, pp. 36-41; Faraone, S.V., Sergeant, J., Gillberg, C., Biederman, J., The worldwide prevalence of ADHD: Is it an American condition?

This finding was originally demonstrated in adults with ADHD, then in youth with ADHD, and has been tentatively linked to ultra low frequency oscillations within the DMN. The current study evaluates the specificity of DMN abnormalities to neuronal oscillations in the ultra low frequency range, and examines the regional specificity of these DMN aberrations in medicated and unmedicated adults with, and those without ADHD. An individually matched sample of adults with and without ADHD completed 6-minute sessions of resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants with ADHD were known responders to stimulant medications and completed two sessions (predrug/postdrug). MEG data were coregistered to the participant's MRI, corrected for head motion, fitted to a regional-level source model, and subjected to spectral analyses to extract neuronal population activity in regions of the DMN. The unmedicated adults with ADHD exhibited broadband deficits in medial prefrontal cortices (MPFC), but not other DMN regions compared to adults without ADHD. Unmedicated patients also showed abnormal cross-frequency coupling in the gamma range between the MPFC and posterior cingulate areas, and disturbed balance within the DMN as activity in posterior regions was stronger than frontal regions at beta and lower frequencies, which dissipated at higher γ-frequencies. Administration of pharmacotherapy significantly increased prefrontal alpha activity (8-14 Hz) in adults with ADHD, and decreased the cross-frequency gamma coupling. These results indicate that neurophysiological aberrations in the DMN of patients with ADHD are not limited to ultra slow oscillations, and that they may be primarily attributable to abnormal broadband activity in the MPFC.

Method: Primary school teachers read one of four types of vignette describing the behaviour of a 9-year-old child: either a boy or a girl with inattentive or combined subtype of ADHD. Teachers were asked about their conceptualisation of the child's difficulties and their thoughts about need for specialist referral and other interventions. Results: Of 496 teachers, 99% identified the presence of a problem. Subtype (combined) of ADHD influenced teachers' recognition of ADHD and agreement that medication might be helpful. Only 13% of teachers thought that medication might be helpful. Conclusions: Results suggest a need for better teacher awareness about inattentive subtype of ADHD. © 2012 The Authors.

Method: As part of a larger study, a community sample of 68 Spanish-speaking, Latino parents completed the Spanish translation of the Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale (DBD-S), a commonly used, parent-report measure of ADHD. Results: Results suggest that although both the Inattentive and Hyperactive/Impulsive subscales of the DBD-S are psychometrically sound, the Hyperactive/Impulsive subscale may not be culturally appropriate with some Latino families, particularly those who are less acculturated. This was further supported by preliminary evidence suggesting that this subscale also was not diagnostically useful with the current, community sample. Conclusion: The potential problems associated with the overemphasis on symptomatology when working with Latino families, the importance of examining functional impairment as part of a culturally appropriate assessment, and the need to replicate the current findings with a clinical sample are discussed. © 2013 SAGE Publications.","ADHD; assessment; multicultural issues","Abidin, R.R., (1995) Parenting Stress Index, , 1995).

This is mainly due to the fact that, DSM-5 will retain the exact DSM-IV wording of all 18 symptoms, but will add new examples that make the criteria more appropriate for children, adolescents and adults. The age of onset will also be changed from 7 to 12 years, the subtyping of the disorder will change, and pervasive developmental disorders will no longer be an exclusion criterion. Although the main concept is unchanged, the suggested changes will most likely increase the prevalence of ADHD, especially in adults and adolescents, but maybe also in children. The added examples will also result in necessary revisions and new validations of rating scales and diagnostic interviews. This review will examine each of the proposed DSM-5 changes and the impact they may have, and in addition, the paper will make an overview of the main characteristics of some of the international and national guidelines for assessment and treatment of ADHD and how these impact the clinical practice. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); Clinical guidelines; Diagnostic classification; Pervasive developmental disorder","(2012) DSM-5 Development: ADHD and Disruptive Behavior Disorders, , http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevision/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=383, American Psychiatric Association; Barkley, R.A., Brown, T.E., Unrecognized attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults presenting with other psychiatric disorders (2008) CNS Spectr, 13, pp. 977-984; Dalsgaard, S., Humlum, M.K., Nielsen, H.S., Simonsen, M., Relative standards in ADHD diagnoses: The role of specialist behavior (2012) Econ Lett, 117, pp. 663-665; Dalsgaard, S., Mortensen, P.B., Frydenberg, M., Thomsen, P.H., Conduct problems, gender and adult psychiatric outcome of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (2002) Br J Psychiatry, 181, pp. 416-421; Dopfner, M., Banaschewski, T., Krause, J., Skrodzki, K., Management of children, adolescents and adults with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Germany.

The cognitive domains examined were general cognitive ability and executive abilities. Methods: Three different clinical samples of pupils with school problems were analyzed to assess their cognitive Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children profiles. In particular, the general cognitive ability index and the executive markers (ie, verbal memory index and processing speed index) were of interest. Of the total sample (n = 198), two main groups were contrasted; one met the full criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)/subthreshold ADHD, and one was comprised of those with milder attention problems, insufficient to meet the criteria for ADHD/subthreshold ADHD. Results: It could be demonstrated that both groups had a significantly higher score on the general cognitive ability index than on measures of working memory and processing speed. This difference was more pronounced for boys. Conclusion: These types of cognitive differences need to be considered in children with different kinds of learning, behavior, and attention problems; this is also true for children presenting with an average general intelligence quotient and with milder attention problems. Current educational expectations are demanding for children with mild difficulties, and such cognitive information will add to the understanding of the child's learning problems, hopefully leading to a better adapted education than that conventionally available. © 2013 Ek et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Children; Learning and attention problems; Processing speed; Subthreshold; Working memory","Kaufman, A.S., (1994) Intelligent Testing With the WISC III, , New York, NY: Wiley; Smedler, A.C., Törestad, B., Verbal intelligence: A key to basic skills (1996) Educ Stud, 22, pp. 343-355; Ek, U., Westerlund, J., Holmberg, K., Fernell, E., Academic performance of adolescents with ADHD and other behavioural and learning problems a population-based longitudinal study (2011) Acta Paediatr, 100, pp. 402-406; Foley, J., Garcia, J., Shaw, L., Golden, C., IQ predicts neuropsychological performance in children (2009) Int J Neurosci, 119, pp. 1830-1847; Geary, D.C., Cognitive predictors of achievement growth in mathematics: A 5-year longitudinal study (2011) Dev Psychol, 47, pp. 1539-1552; Saklofske, D.H., Prifitera, A., Weiss, L.G., Rolfhus, E., Zhu, J., Clinical interpretation of the WISC-IV FSIQ and GAI (2005) WISC-IV Clinical Use and Interpretation: Scientist-Practitioner Perspectives, , In: Prifitera A, Saklofske DH, Weiss LG, editors, New York, NY: Academic Press; Pennington, B.F., Ozonoff, S., Executive functions and developmental psychopathology (1996) J Child Psychol Psychiatry, 37, pp. 51-87; Rucklidge, J.J., Tannock, R., Neuropsychological profiles of adolescents with ADHD: Effects of reading difficulties and gender (2002) J Child Psychol Psychiatry, 43, pp. 988-1003; Gropper, R.J., Tannock, R., A pilot study of working memory and academic achievement in college students with ADHD (2009) J Atten Disord, 12, pp. 574-581; Zander, E., Dahlgren, S.O., WISC-III index score profiles of 520 Swedish children with pervasive developmental disorders (2010) Psychol Assess, 22, pp. 213-222; Montgomery, J.W., Windsor, J., Examining the language performances of children with and without specific language impairment: Contributions of phonological short-term memory and speed of processing (2007) J Speech Lang Hear Res, 50, pp. 778-797; Alloway, T.P., Working memory and executive function profiles of individuals with borderline intellectual functioning (2010) J Intellect Disabil Res, 54, pp. 448-456; Danielsson, H., Henry, L., Messer, D., Rönnberg, J., Strengths and weaknesses in executive functioning in children with intellectual disability (2012) Res Dev Disabil, 33, pp. 600-607; Jacobson, L.A., Ryan, M., Martin, R.B., Working memory influences processing speed and reading fluency in ADHD (2011) Child Neuropsychol, 17, pp. 209-224; Katz, L.J., Brown, F.C., Roth, R.M., Beers, S.R., Processing speed and working memory performance in those with both ADHD and a reading disorder compared with those with ADHD alone (2011) Arch Clin Neuropsychol, 26, pp. 425-433; Swanson, H.L., Sachse-Lee, C., Mathematical problem solving and working memory in children with learning disabilities: Both executive and phonological processes are important (2001) J Exp Child Psychol, 79, pp. 294-321; Mayes, S.D., Calhoun, S.L., Learning, attention, writing and processing speed in typical children and children with ADHD, autism, anxiety, depression and oppositional-defiant disorder (2007) Child Neuropsychol, 13, pp. 469-493; Ek, U., Fernell, E., Westerlund, J., Holmberg, K., Olsson, P.O., Gillberg, C., Cognitive strengths and deficits in schoolchildren with ADHD (2007) Acta Paediatr, 96, pp. 756-761; Ek, U., Norrelgen, F., Westerlund, J., Dahlman, A., Hultby, E., Fernell, E., Teenage outcomes after speech and language impairment at preschool age (2012) Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat, 8, pp. 221-227; Ek, U., Westerlund, J., Furmark, C., Fernell, E., An audit of teenagers who had not succeeded in elementary school: A retrospective case review (2012) Clinical Audit, 4, pp. 1-7; Wechsler, D., (1999) Wechsler Intelligence Scale For Children, , 3rd ed.

Results showed significant treatment effects for parent and clinician ratings of ADHD symptoms, child self-report of ability to focus, and parent ratings of executive functioning. Child performance on neuropsychological tests showed significant treatment-related improvement on strategic planning efficiency, but no treatment effects were observed on other neuropsychological outcomes. Treatment effects were also not observed for teacher ratings of ADHD. These data add to a growing body of literature supporting effects of cognitive training on attention and behavior, however, additional research is warranted. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","ADHD; Attention training; Cognitive training; Executive functioning; Intervention","Beauregard, M., Levesque, J., Functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation of the effects of neurofeedback training on the neural bases of selective attention and response inhibition in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (2006) Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback, 31, pp. 3-20; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 57, pp. 289-300; Brefczynski-Lewis, J.A., Lutz, A., Schaefer, H.S., Levinson, D.B., Davidson, R.J., Neural correlates of attentional expertise in long-term meditation practitioners (2007) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 104, pp. 11483-11488; Cohen, J., A power primer (1992) Psychological Bulletin, 112, pp. 155-159; Conners, K., Jeff, J.L., (1999) ADHD in Adults and Children: The Latest Assessment and Treatment Strategies, , Compact Clinicals Kansas City; Coull, J.T., Neural correlates of attention and arousal: Insights from electrophysiology, functional neuroimaging and psychopharmacology (1998) Progress in Neurobiology, 55, pp. 343-361; Delis, D.C., Kaplan, E., Kramer, J.H., (2001) Delis Kaplan Executive Function System: Examiner's Manual, , Psychological Corporation San Antonio; Delis, D.C., Kramer, J.H., Kaplan, E., Holdnack, J., Reliability and validity of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System: An update (2004) Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society, 10, pp. 301-303; Derryberry, D., Reed, M.A., Anxiety-related attentional biases and their regulation by attentional control (2002) Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 111, pp. 225-236; Dupaul, G.J., Power, T.J., Anastopoulos, A.D., Reid, R., (1998) ADHD Rating Scale-IV: Checklists, Norms, and Clinical Interpretation, , Guilford Press New York; Enders, C.K., (2010) Applied Missing Data Analysis, , Guilford New York; Epstein, J.N., Tsal, Y., Evidence for cognitive training as a treatment strategy for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (2010) Journal of ADHD and Related Disorders, 1, pp. 49-64; Erickson, K.I., Colcombe, S.J., Wadhwa, R., Bherer, L., Peterson, M.S., Scalf, P.E., Kramer, A.F., Training-induced functional activation changes in dual-task processing: An FMRI study (2007) Cerebral Cortex, 17, pp. 192-204; Ethier, M., Braun, C.M.J., Baribeau, J.M.C., Computer-dispensed cogntive-perceptual training of closed head injury patients after spontenous recovery, Study 1: Speeded tasks (1989) Canadian Journal of Rehabilitation, 2, pp. 223-233; Fajkowska, M., Derryberry, D., Psychometric properties of Attentional Control Scale: The preliminary study on a Polish sample (2010) Polish Psychological Bulletin, 41, pp. 1-7; Feldon, D.F., Peugh, J., Timmerman, B.E., Maher, M.A., Hurst, M., Strickland, D., Stiegelmeyer, C., Graduate students' teaching experiences improve their methodological research skills (2011) Science, 333, pp. 1037-1039; Finlayson, M.A.J., Alfano, D.P., Sullivan, J.F., A neuropsychological approach to cognitive remediation: Microcomputer applications (1987) Canadian Psychology, 28, pp. 180-190; Gernsbacher, M.A., Cognitive processes and mechanisms in language comprehension: The structure building framework (1991) The Psychology of Learning and Motivation, 27 VOL., pp. 217-263. , G.H.

Our hypothesis was that people with ADHD most commonly turn to sports. Method: The study enrolled 318 (75.7% of 420) students who were studying in the SPES of Gaziantep University; 277 students from the medical, nursing, administration, and engineering faculties were enrolled to serve as a control group. All students enrolled in the study were informed about the study before the lesson, and the students who agreed to participate provided written consent. Scales used in this study were: a sociodemographic information form which was prepared by the investigators, the Wender-Utah Rating Scale (WURS), and the Adult ADD/ADHD DSM-IV Based Diagnostic Screening and Rating Scale (ADD/ADHD). Results: WURS scores were significantly higher (25.07 ± 15.15 versus 21.37 ± 14.28; p = 0.002) in the SPES group than the control group. In addition, the percentage of subjects with a WURS score above the cut-off of 36 was higher in the SPES group than the control group (22.4% versus 15.2%; p: 0.028). The two groups were not significantly different in terms of the subscales of the ADD/ADHD scale. A correlation was found between the educational achievement of the students in the SPES group and the ADD/ADHD-inattention subscale (r = .111, p = 0.015) and WURS scale (r = .113, p = 0.011). Conclusions: More systematic studies with larger samples in this domain will be useful in obtaining a clearer picture regarding professional attraction of people with ADHD to sports. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.","attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; education; sport","(2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-IV-TR, , American Psychiatric Association.(4th ed.).

The study included eighty-eight adolescents with LOC eating, ADHD symptoms, and control. Participants self-reported on mood and participated in a stop signal task before and after negative mood induction with Cyberball. Groups did not differ in impulsivity at baseline (p >.05). The LOC group presented with greater increase of negative mood than the ADHD group, and with greater increase of impulsivity than both other groups from pre- to post-Cyberball (p <.05). Stronger reactivity of negative mood and impulsivity in LOC eating corroborates findings in adults that the concepts' association might be specific to binge eating disorder. Additionally, findings add to previous results showing emotion regulation deficits in LOC eating. Future research should examine the concepts' impact on actual eating behavior including binge eating. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Adolescents; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Impulsivity; Loss of control eating; Negative mood; Stop signal task","Galanti, K., Gluck, M.E., Geliebter, A., Test meal intake in obese binge eaters in relation to impulsivity and compulsivity (2007) Int J Eat Disord, 40 (8), pp. 727-732. , 17683093 10.1002/eat.20441; Nasser, J.A., Gluck, M.E., Geliebter, A., Impulsivity and test meal intake in obese binge eating women (2004) Appetite., 43 (3), pp. 303-307. , 15527933 10.1016/j.appet.2004.04.006; Wolfe, B.E., Baker, C.W., Smith, A.T., Validity and utility of the current definition of binge eating (2009) Int J Eat Disord, 42 (8), pp. 674-686. , 19610126 10.1002/eat.20728; Combs, J.L., Pearson, C.M., Smith, G.T., A risk model for preadolescent disordered eating (2011) Int J Eat Disord, 44 (7), pp. 596-604; Fischer, S., Settles, R., Collins, B., The role of negative urgency and expectancies in problem drinking and disordered eating: Testing a model of comorbidity in pathological and at-risk samples (2012) Psychol Addict Behav, 26 (1), pp. 112-123; Pearson, C.M., Combs, J.L., Smith, G.T., A risk model for disordered eating in late elementary school boys (2010) Psychol Addict Behav, 24 (4), pp. 696-704. , 20822190 10.1037/a0020358; Anestis, M.D., Peterson, C.B., Bardone-Cone, A.M., Affective lability and impulsivity in a clinical sample of women with bulimia nervosa: The role of affect in severely dysregulated behavior (2009) Int J Eat Disord, 42 (3), pp. 259-266. , 18951460 10.1002/eat.20606; Fischer, S., Smith, G.T., Anderson, K.G., Clarifying the role of impulsivity in bulimia nervosa (2003) Int J Eat Disord, 33 (4), pp. 406-411. , 12658670 10.1002/eat.10165; Fischer, S., Anderson, K.G., Smith, G.T., Coping with distress by eating or drinking: Role of trait urgency and expectancies (2004) Psychol Addict Behav, 18 (3), pp. 269-274. , 15482082 10.1037/0893-164X.18.3.269; Bekker, M.H., Van De Meerendonk, C., Mollerus, J., Effects of negative mood induction and impulsivity on self-perceived emotional eating (2004) Int J Eat Disord, 36 (4), pp. 461-469. , 15558635 10.1002/eat.20041; Whiteside, S., Lynam, D., The five factor model and impulsivity: Using a structural model of personality to understand impulsivity (2001) Pers Individ Diff, 30, pp. 669-689. , 10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00064-7; (2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association (APA) 4th edn, text revision.

We investigated whether subclinical B 1 deficiency in early infancy had medical, neurodevelopmental, or cognitive effects at 3-5 y of age.Methods:A historical prospective cohort study was conducted consisting of four groups: ""exposed,"" consuming a B 1-deficient soy-based formula exclusively for four consecutive weeks or longer; ""control,"" consuming no soy-based formula; ""mixed,"" consuming the formula nonexclusively or exclusively for less than four consecutive weeks; and ""other,"" consuming soy-based formulas other than Remedia. Participants were evaluated by medical examination, Stanford-Binet (SB) intelligence test, sensory profile evaluation, and Conners scales (attention deficit disorder/attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD)).Results:Following adjustment for gender, age, and maternal education, there were no significant differences among the four groups on the mean SB scores, on the verbal and nonverbal scores, or in the proportion of children in each group with scores <90. A significantly higher proportion of exposed children as compared with control children had an impaired sensory profile and scores on the Conners scales (ADD/ADHD), but these proportions were also high in the ""other"" and ""mixed"" groups.Conclusion:The results do not support an association between subclinical B 1 deficiency in infancy and long-term development. © 2013 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.",,"Davis, R.E., Icke, G.C., Clinical chemistry of thiamine (1983) Adv Clin Chem, 232, pp. 93-140; (1998) Dietary Reference Intakes: Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B-6, Vitamin B-12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline, pp. 58-86. , Food and Nutrition Board Institute of Medicine Thiamine Washington DC: National Academy Press; (1999) Thiamine Deficiency and Its Prevention and Control in Major Emergencies, , http://www.who.int/nut/documents/thiamine_in_emergencies_eng.pdf, WHO Publication WHO/NHD/99 13; Todd, K., Butterworth, R.F., Mechanisms of selective neuronal cell death due to thiamine deficiency (1999) Ann N y Acad Sci, 893, pp. 404-411; Kliegman, R.M., Behrman, R.E., Jenson, H.B., Stanton, B.F., (2007) Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, pp. 246-247. , 18th edn.

This practical book provides a foundation for clinicians to learn about this groundbreaking medical advancement, which has been used with a wide range of conditions. The book illustrates the results of the use of LENS in more than 100 cases, as well as applications with brain-based problems in animals.LENS: The Low Energy Neuro feedback System is a comprehensive overview of the history and evolution of clinical use of this innovative approach. One of the unique features of LENS is that it can not only be used with adults and children, but it can also be used with small children and more seriously disabled individuals who lack the impulse control, attention, or stamina to concentrate for the more extended periods of time required in traditional neuro feedback. The book presents an outcome study on 100 cases where LENS was successfully applied to a wide range of clinical symptoms, as well as case studies on the use of LENS with neuro developmental and learning disabilities.LENS: The Low Energy Neuro feedback System details the application of LENS in the clinical treatment of: •head injuries •ADD/ADHD •autism •learning disabilities •fibromyalgia •anger and explosiveness •depression •developmental disorders •anxiety •insomnia •epilepsy •addictions •and much moreLENS: The Low Energy Neuro feedback System is an essential professional resource for psychologists, social workers, licensed counselors, and biofeedback professionals. © 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

To establish the level of evidence, knowledge gaps and areas requiring additional research. Concussion is defined as a traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function and involves a complex pathophysiological process. Concussion is a subset of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) which is generally self-limited and at the less-severe end of the brain injury spectrum. Animal and human studies support the concept of postconcussive vulnerability, showing that a second blow before the brain has recovered results in worsening metabolic changes within the cell. Experimental evidence suggests the concussed brain is less responsive to usual neural activation and when premature cognitive or physical activity occurs before complete recovery the brain may be vulnerable to prolonged dysfunction. INCIDENCE: It is estimated that as many as 3.8 million concussions occur in the USA per year during attention-deficit disorders (ADD/ADHD) and migraine headaches complicate checklists provide an objective tool for assessing a variety of symptoms related to concussions, while also tracking the severity of those symptoms over serial evaluations. Standardised assessment tools provide a helpful structure for the evaluation of concussion, although limited validation of these assessment tools is available. SIDELINE Additional research is needed to validate current assessment tools, delineate the role of NP testing and improve identification of those at risk of prolonged post-concussive symptoms or other long-term complications. Evolving technologies for the diagnosis of concussion, such as newer neuroimaging techniques or biological markers, may provide new insights into the evaluation and management of sports concussion.",,,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871258001

This article presents 3 cases involving patients with chronic fatigue syndrome who responded poorly to treatment. After clinical evaluation, all patients were found to meet criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and underwent a standard regimen of a psychostimulant medication. After treatment with psychostimulants, the 3 patients reported improved symptoms of fatigue and pain, and cognitive and core ADHD symptoms. These cases suggest that ADHD and chronic fatigue syndrome (and possibly fibromyalgia) share a common underlying mechanism. This article presents a model suggesting that over time, ADHD (predominantly inattentive type) develops into a syndrome of chronic fatigue and pain. These cases indicate that fatigue may be an important presenting symptom of adult ADHD. These cases also suggest the need for additional research to determine the prevalence of ADHD in patients who present with fatigue, and, in those meeting criteria for ADHD, the responsiveness of fatigue to psychostimulant treatment. © Postgraduate Medicine.","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; Chronic fatigue syndrome; Chronic pain; Fibromyalgia; Lisdexamfetamine","Chew-Graham, C., Dowrick, C., Wearden, A., Richardson, V., Peters, S., Making the diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalitis in primary care: A qualitative study (2010) BMC Fam Pract, 11, p. 16; (2012) Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Workup, , http://emedicine.med-scape.com/article/235980-workup, Medscape, Accessed September 12; Stephens, P., (2010) Reversing Chronic Disease: A Journey Back to Health, , Mustang, OK: Tate Publishing; (2012) Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Background, , http://www.cdc.gov/cfs, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Accessed October 17; Reynolds, K.J., Vernon, S.D., Bouchery, E., Reeves, W.C., The economic impact of chronic fatigue syndrome (2004) Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2, p. 4; Short, K., McCabe, M., Tooley, G., Cognitive functioning in chronic fatigue syndrome and the role of depression, anxiety, and fatigue (2002) J Psychosom Res, 52, pp. 475-483; Van der Meer, J.W., Netea, M.J., Galama, J.M., van Kuppeveld, F.J., Comment on ""Detection of an infectious retrovirus, XMRV, in blood cells of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (2010) Science, 328 (5980), p. 825; Stephens, P., (2010) Reversing Chronic Disease: A Journey Back to Health, , Mustang, OK: Tate Publishing; (2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, Fourth Edition, Text Revision.

Although people with ADHD display difficulties in timing of paced motor tasks and evidence altered time perception, studies have failed to show a difference in spontaneous finger tapping rate and have demonstrated inconsistent findings regarding finger tapping variability. We hypothesized that a more detailed analysis of finger tapping, which included the two main finger tapping phases: the touch-phase, defined as the time between onset and offset of the finger tap, and the off-phase, the period between offset and onset, would reveal a significant difference between people with and without ADHD. For this purpose, a highly sensitive system for finger tapping recording and analysis was developed. Finger tapping analysis was carried out on a total of 109 subjects; 68 had been diagnosed with ADHD, and 41 were without any diagnosis (control). We found that the variability of the touch phase (onset to offset), as measured using the coefficient of variation of the touch phase in subjects with ADHD, was significantly higher than that of subjects in the control group, while no differences were found in other parameters such as the finger tapping rate or the off phase. © 2012 IEEE.","Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD/ADHD); Finger Tapping; Internal Timing; Spontaneous Motor Tempo (SMT)","Fraisse, P., Rhythm and tempo (1982) The Psychology of Music, pp. 149-180. , Deutsch D (Ed.); Drake, C., Jones, M.R., Baruch, C., The development of rhythmic attending in auditory sequences: Attunement, referent period, focal attending (2000) Cognition, 77 (3), pp. 251-288; Baudouin, A., Vanneste, S., Isingrini, M., Aging and internal timing: Processing-speed or spontaneous motor tempo slowing?

The world of athletics has grappled with the use of anabolic steroids for years, finally implementing anti-doping laws2 and strict guidelines for athletes. However, in the academic setting, a similar problem has arisen that cannot be solved by random drug testing or other anti-doping mechanisms. Since the genesis of ADD/ADHD in the early 1980s, affected individuals have been able to procure medications that enhance cognitive capabilities: the ability to focus, concentrate, and retain information. Those truly suffering from ADHD reap the benefits of these medications while many non-affected people now acquire the drug for themselves to get ahead, primarily within academic settings. The prevalence of Adderall and the ease with which individuals, particularly students, can obtain it, through a diagnosis or illegal procurement, is alarming and presents ethical issues. Various solutions, including random drug testing heightened disciplinary procedures, and education programs, have been proposed but do not attack the crux of the issue. Instead, this Note posits that to stem the abuse of ADHD medications in academic settings, the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) should be amended to include ADHD as a specific learning disability and to develop a mandatory standardized diagnostic test that must be performed prior to the diagnosis of ADHD and the prescribing of Adderall that focuses on the adverse educational effect the disorder has on individuals. Currently, individuals can obtain an ADHD diagnosis and an Adderall prescription without much effort by meeting highly subjective criteria. By addressing the high rate of ADHD diagnoses and the ease with which this Schedule II Controlled Substance is obtained, only those requiring the drug will be able to obtain it and those seeking a competitive edge will be out of luck. This Note will proceed in five parts. Part I will identify background information on ADHD including diagnosis and treatment. Part II will address the current problem surrounding ADHD medications, specifically Adderall, focusing on the misuse/abuse on college and university campuses. Part III will discuss the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) as well as § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the services provided to students with disabilities and/or ADHD. Part IV will propose a two-pronged solution to the overabundance of Adderall and the subsequent misuse by students. By amending IDEA and implementing a standard diagnostic test for ADHD, access to Adderall will decrease and the potential for abuse will be greatly lowered. Finally, Part V will address the implications of this alteration as well as aspects that cannot be addressed by a legislative mandate. The inclusion of ADHD as an enumerated learning disability under IDEA combined with a standardized identification and diagnosis procedure will allow individuals suffering from ADHD to receive appropriate treatment while preventing the illegal use of Adderall by those seeking an academic boost. © 2012 Erinn L.

Preliminary studies with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of the brain have reported differences in brain metabolite concentration-to-Cr ratios between individuals with ADHD and unaffected controls in several frontal brain regions including anterior cingulate cortex. Using multivoxel 1H-MRS, we compared 14 individuals affected with ADHD to 20 individuals without ADHD from the same genetic isolate. After controlling by sex, age, and multiple testing, we found significant differences at the right posterior cingulate of the Glx/Cr ratio density distribution function between ADHD cases and controls (P &lt; 0. 05). Furthermore, we found several interactions of metabolite concentration-to-Cr ratio, age, and ADHD status: Ins/Cr and Glx/Cr ratios at the left posterior cingulate, and NAA/Cr at the splenius, right posterior cingulate, and at the left posterior cingulate. We also found a differential metabolite ratio interaction between ADHD cases and controls for Ins/Cr and NAA/Cr at the right striatum. These results show that: (1) NAA/Cr, Glx/Cr, and Ins/Cr ratios, as reported in other studies, exhibit significant differences between ADHD cases and controls; (2) differences of these metabolite ratios between ADHD cases and controls evolve in specific and recognizable patterns throughout age, a finding that replicates previous results obtained by structural MRI, where is demonstrated that brain ontogeny follows a different program in ADHD cases and controls; (3) Ins/Cr and NAA/Cr ratios, at the right striatum, interact in a differential way between ADHD cases and controls. As a whole, these results replicate previous 1H-MRS findings and add new intriguing differential metabolic and ontogeny patterns between ADHD cases and controls that warrant further pursue. © 2012 Springer-Verlag (outside the USA).","1H-MRS; ADHD; Genetics; MRI; Ontogeny","Acosta, M.T., Castellanos, F.X., Bolton, K.L., Balog, J.Z., Eagen, P., Nee, L., Jones, J., Muenke, M., Latent class subtyping of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and comorbid conditions (2008) J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 47 (7), pp. 797-807. , doi:10.1097/CHI.0b013e318173f70b; Arcos-Burgos, M., Muenke, M., Genetics of population isolates (2002) Clin Genet, 61 (4), pp. 233-247; Arcos-Burgos, M., Castellanos, F.X., Lopera, F., Pineda, D., Palacio, J.D., Garcia, M., Henao, G.C., Muenke, M., Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): feasibility of linkage analysis in a genetic isolate using extended and multigenerational pedigrees (2002) Clin Genet, 61 (5), pp. 335-343; Arcos-Burgos, M., Castellanos, F.X., Pineda, D., Lopera, F., Palacio, J.D., Palacio, L.G., Rapoport, J.L., Muenke, M., Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in a population isolate: linkage to loci at 4q13.2, 5q33.3, 11q22, and 17p11 (2004) Am J Hum Genet, 75 (6), pp. 998-1014. , doi:10.1086/426154; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) J Roy Stat Soc: Ser B (Methodol), 57 (1), pp. 289-300; Benjamini, Y., Drai, D., Elmer, G., Kafkafi, N., Golani, I., Controlling the false discovery rate in behavior genetics research (2001) Behav Brain Res, 125 (1-2), pp. 279-284; Biederman, J., Faraone, S.V., Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (2005) Lancet, 366 (9481), pp. 237-248. , doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66915-2; Castillo, M., Smith, J.K., Kwock, L., Correlation of myo-inositol levels and grading of cerebral astrocytomas (2000) AJNR Am J Neuroradiol, 21 (9), pp. 1645-1649; Ellison-Wright, I., Ellison-Wright, Z., Bullmore, E., Structural brain change in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder identified by meta-analysis (2008) BMC Psychiatry, 8, p. 51. , doi:10.1186/1471-244X-8-51; Faraone, S.V., Biederman, J., Mennin, D., Gershon, J., Tsuang, M.T., A prospective four-year follow-up study of children at risk for ADHD: psychiatric, neuropsychological, and psychosocial outcome (1996) J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 35 (11), pp. 1449-1459. , doi:10.1097/00004583-199611000-00013; Hesslinger, B., Thiel, T., Tebartz van Elst, L., Hennig, J., Ebert, D., Attention-deficit disorder in adults with or without hyperactivity: where is the difference?

This remarkable new book offers fresh perspectives on ADD/ADHD. Even more important, it provides new direction for sufferers, introducing an ecologically based lifestyle that focuses on hands-on interactive learning. Fragments: Coping with Attention Deficit Disorder shows how to use environmental education and activities such as organic farming, community service, mission work, art, yoga, meditation, and spirituality to bring about positive change in people diagnosed with ADD or ADHD. From author Amy E. Stein: ""This book is about life. It is written for those who think they have no hope, who struggle with life, with decisions, with addiction, and in search of themselves. I do not believe traditional psychotherapy or medication are solutions for those of us who fall under the label of ADD or ADHD."" Candidly written by a woman who, at age 25, was diagnosed as ""a textbook case for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,"" this insightful book examines: • The pitfalls of traditional psychotherapy and medication for those diagnosed with ADD/ADHD • how an interactive hands-on learning environment can markedly improve the educational experience of ADD/ADHD kids • how an organic, holistic approach can benefit those diagnosed with ADD/ADHD • the correlation between agriculture and ADD/ADHD and the impact of eliminating pesticides and increasing fatty acid intake in the diets of sufferers • how incorporating spirituality and faith into ADD/ADHD sufferers' lives can help to add discipline and bring greater satisfaction • and much more! Five helpful appendices give you easy access to environmental education resources, agricultural resources, a sample agricultural curriculum, a sample ecology curriculum, and an environmental art curriculum. © 2003 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Because the identification of EBD examines behaviors that tend to be more subjective in nature than other disabilities and because these pervasive behaviors are manifested in a variety of forms, EBD is one of the most misidentified disability categories (Skiba, Poloni-Staudinger, Gallini, Simmons, & Feggins-Azziz, 2006). For students with EBD, the behavior(s) they exhibit contribute to learning difficulties in multiple academic and functional areas. This chapter provides in-depth information on the common characteristics and behavioral dimensions of this population. Additionally, the in-school performance and long-term outcomes of students with EBD are discussed.

This article is believed to be the earliest reference to the syndrome that today is known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Method: The authors briefly discuss previous efforts to identify the earliest description of ADHD thought to be the lectures of George Still in 1902 and subsequently, the medical textbook by the physician, Alexander Crichton, in 1798. Background is provided on Weikard followed by the English translation of his short chapter on attention deficits and the rationale for why it should be viewed as relevant to the history of ADHD. Results and Conclusions: The authors argue that Weikard's description in 1775 now deserves to be credited with providing the first description of attention disorders in the medical literature known to date. © 2012 SAGE Publications.","ADD/ADHD; ADHD; adult; adult ADHD; history of ADHD; inattention","Accardo, P.J., Blondis, T.A., (2000) Attention Deficits and Hyperactivity in Children and Adults: Diagnosis, Treatment, Management, pp. 1-12. , Accardo P.

While both show deficits in executive functions, it has been suggested that they may differ in their response to monetary reward. For instance, children with ADHD prefer small immediate over large delayed rewards more than typically developing controls. One explanation for this is that they discount the value of rewards to a higher degree as they are moved into the future. The current study investigated whether children with ADHD can be differentiated from those with ASD in terms of reward discounting. Thirty-nine children (8-16y) with ADHD, 34 children with ASD and 46 typically developing controls performed a hypothetical monetary temporal discounting task. Participants were instructed to make repeated choices between small variable rewards (0, 5, 10, 20, 30€) delivered immediately and large rewards delivered after a variable delay. Children with ADHD but not ASD discounted future rewards at a higher rate than typically developing controls. These data confirm steeper discounting of future rewards in ADHD and add to a small but growing literature showing that the psychological profile of ADHD can be distinguished from that of ASD in terms of disrupted motivational processes. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Achenbach, T.M., Rescorla, L.A., (2001) Manual for the ASEBA school-age forms and profiles, , Burlington, VT: University of Vermont; (2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association.

We explored the efficacy of robotic technology in improving handwriting in children with impaired motor skills. METHOD. Eighteen participants had impairments arising from cerebral palsy (CP), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or other disorders. The intervention was robotic-guided three-dimensional repetitive motion in 15-20 daily sessions of 25-30 min each over 4-8 wk. RESULTS. Fine motor control improved for the children with learning disabilities and those ages 9 or older but not for those with CP or under age 9. All children with ASD or ADHD referred for slow writing speed were able to increase speed while maintaining legibility. CONCLUSION. Three-dimensional, robot-assisted, repetitive motion training improved handwriting fluidity in children with mild to moderate fine motor deficits associated with ASD or ADHD within 10 hr of training. This dosage may not be sufficient for children with CP.","Handwriting; Motor skills; Motor skills disorders; Robotics; Therapy, computer-assisted","Amundson, S.J., (1995) Evaluation Tool of Children's Handwriting, , Homer, AK: OT Kids; Beery, K.E., Buktenica, N.A., Beery, N.A., (1989) The Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration (5th Ed.), , Parsippany, NJ: Modern Curriculum Press; Berninger, V.W., Highlights of programmatic, interdisciplinary research on writing (2009) Learning Disabilities Research and Practice, 24, pp. 69-80. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5826.2009.00281.x; Bluteau, J., Coquillart, S., Payan, Y., Gentaz, E., Haptic guidance improves the visuo-manual tracking of trajectories (2008) Plos ONE, 3 (3), pp. e1775; Brewer, B.R., Klatzky, R., Matsuoka, Y., Visual feedback distortion in a robotic environment for hand rehabilitation (2008) Brain Research Bulletin, 75, pp. 804-813. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2008.01.006; Bütefisch, C., Hummelsheim, H., Denzler, P., Mauritz, K.H., Repetitive training of isolated movements improves the outcome of motor rehabilitation of the centrally paretic hand (1995) Journal of the Neurological Sciences, 130, pp. 59-68. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-510X(95)00003-K; Case-Smith, J., Effectiveness of school-based occupational therapy intervention on handwriting (2002) American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 56, pp. 17-25. , http://dx.doi.org/10.5014/ajot.56.1.17; Cook, A.M., Meng, M.Q.-H., Gu, J.J., Howery, K., Development of a robotic device for facilitating learning by children who have severe disabilities (2002) IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, 10 (3), pp. 178-187. , DOI 10.1109/TNSRE.2002.802877; Daly, C.J., Kelley, G.T., Krauss, A., Relationship between visual-motor integration and handwriting skills of children in kindergarten: A modified replication study (2003) American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 57 (4), pp. 459-462; Denton, P.L., Cope, S., Moser, C., The effects of sensorimotor-based intervention versus therapeutic practice on improving handwriting performance in 6- to 11-year-old children (2006) American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 60 (1), pp. 16-27; Deutsch, J.E., Borbely, M., Filler, J., Huhn, K., Guarrera-Bowlby, P., Use of a low-cost, commercially available gaming console (Wii) for rehabilitation of an adolescent with cerebral palsy (2008) Physical Therapy, 88, pp. 1196-1207. , http://dx.doi.org/10.2522/ptj.20080062; Fasoli, S.E., Fragala-Pinkham, M., Hughes, R., Hogan, N., Krebs, H.I., Stein, J., Upper limb robotic therapy for children with hemiplegia (2008) American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, 87, pp. 929-936. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/PHM.0b013e31818a6aa4; Fuentes, C.T., Mostofsky, S.H., Bastian, A.J., Children with autism show specific handwriting impairments (2009) Neurology, 73, pp. 1532-1537. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181c0d48c; Graham, S., Harris, K.R., Almost 30 years of writing research: Making sense of it all with the Wrath of Khan (2009) Learning Disabilities Research and Practice, 24, pp. 58-68. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5826.2009.01277.x, 10.1111/j.1540-5826 200901277x; Hammerschmidt, S.L., Sudsawad, P., Teachers' survey on problems with handwriting: Referral, evaluation, and outcomes (2004) American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 58 (2), pp. 185-192; Henderson, S.E., Green, D., Handwriting Problems in Children with Asperger Syndrome, , www.nha-handwriting.org.uk/Article-2.htm; Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997, , Pub.

To investigate visual function and ocular features in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods. Fifty-one children underwent a detailed ophthalmologic evaluation. Thirty-two were diagnosed with ADHD, and 19 children with attention deficit disorder (ADD). The mean age was 9.9±3.1 years. Results. The average best-corrected visual acuity of the better-seeing eye was 1 (range 0.9-1.25) and 0.96 (range 0.5-1.25) for the fellow eye. Eighteen percent (10) had amblyopia in one or both eyes (3 had strabismic and 7 had ametropic amblyopia). Heterotropia was found in 5 (10%), and absent stereoacuity was found in 3 (6%). Subnormal convergence amplitude was noted in 2 patients (4%). The mean spherical equivalent (SE) of the eyes in this study was 0.17±1.73 (range -5.5 to +7). Twenty-two subjects (43%) had a myopia of -0.50 D or higher. Hyperopia higher than 3.5 D was seen in 10 cases (20%), and astigmatism larger or equal to 1.0 D was observed in 10 patients (20%). With-the-rule astigmatism was by far most common type in the 29 eyes with an astigmatic refractive error (59%). Significant ametropia was detected in 42 (83%) of the patients. In contrast to other studies, we did not find a higher rate of convergence insufficiency or heterotropia. Conclusions. Children diagnosed with either ADHD or ADD can present with significant ametropia but infrequent heterotropia. © 2012 Wichtig Editore.","Attention deficit disorder; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Ritalin","Sowell, E.R., Thompson, P.M., Welcome, S.E., Henkenius, A.L., Toga, A.W., Peterson, B.S., Cortical abnormalities in children and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (2003) Lancet, 362, pp. 1699-707; Lee, J.S., Kim, B.N., Kang, E., Regional cerebral blood flow in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Comparison before and after methylphenidate treatment (2005) Hum Brain Mapp, 24, pp. 157-64; Overton, P.G., Collicular dysfunction in attention deficit hyper-activity disorder (2008) Med Hypotheses, 70, pp. 1121-1127; Feifel, D., Farber, R.H., Clementz, B.A., Perry, W., Anllo-Vento, L., Inhibitory deficits in ocular motor behavior in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (2004) Biol Psychiatry, 56, pp. 333-339; Grönlund, M.A., Aring, E., Landgren, M., Hellström, A., Visual function and ocular features in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, with and without treatment with stimulants (2007) Eye, 21, pp. 494-502; Granet, D.B., Gomi, C.F., Ventura, R., Miller-Scholte, A., The relationship between convergence insufficiency and ADHD (2005) Strabismus, 13, pp. 163-168; Ghanizadeh, A., Visual fields in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder before and after treatment with stimulants (2010) Acta Ophthalmol, 88, pp. e56",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867755585

Methods: Subjects included a birth cohort of all children born 1976-1982 remaining in Rochester, MN after age five (n = 5,718). Among them we identified 379 ADHD incident cases and 758 age-gender matched non-ADHD controls, passively followed to age 19 years. All psychiatric diagnoses were identified and abstracted, but only those confirmed by qualified medical professionals were included in the analysis. For each psychiatric disorder, cumulative incidence rates for subjects with and without ADHD were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Corresponding hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox models adjusted for gender and mother's age and education at the subject's birth. The association between ADHD and the likelihood of having an internalizing or externalizing disorder was summarized by estimating odds ratios (OR). Results: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was associated with a significantly increased risk of adjustment disorders (HR = 3.88), conduct/oppositional defiant disorder (HR = 9.54), mood disorders (HR = 3.67), anxiety disorders (HR = 2.94), tic disorders (HR = 6.53), eating disorders (HR = 5.68), personality disorders (HR = 5.80), and substance-related disorders (HR = 4.03). When psychiatric comorbidities were classified on the internalization-externalization dimension, ADHD was strongly associated with coexisting internalizing/ externalizing (OR = 10.6), or externalizing-only (OR = 10.0) disorders. Conclusion: This population-based study confirms that children with ADHD are at significantly increased risk for a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Besides treating the ADHD, clinicians should identify and provide appropriate treatment for psychiatric comorbidities. © 2012 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.","ADD/ADHD; epidemiology; psychiatric practice","(2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), , American Psychiatric Association.

The aim of this study is to compare patients with early and late onset of ADHD impairment in terms of neuropsychological and personality characteristics. Adult patients with ADHD (n = 415) were evaluated in the ADHD outpatient program at Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Brazil. The diagnostic process for ADHD and comorbidities was based on DSM-IV criteria. The comparison between the two ages of onset groups (before 7; n = 209 or from 7 to 12 years; n = 206) was performed with ANOVA, followed by Stepwise forward regression analyses to restrict the number of comparisons and access the possible effect of multiple confounders. Patients with early onset ADHD present higher scores in novelty seeking in both analyses (respectively P = 0.016 and P = 0.002), but similar cognitive and attention features as compared with the late onset group. These data add to previous evidence that despite a more externalizing profile of early onset ADHD, the overall performance is similar reinforcing the need for awareness and inclusion of the late onset group in DSM-V diagnostic criteria. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","ADHD; Adults; Age of onset; Cognition; Diagnostic criteria; Personality","Adler, L.A., Monitoring adults with ADHD: a focus on executive and behavioral function (2010) The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 71, pp. e18; (1980) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, American Psychiatric Association, Washington; (1994) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, American Psychiatric Association, Washington; Anckarsater, H., Stahlberg, O., Larson, T., Hakansson, C., Jutblad, S.B., Niklasson, L., The impact of ADHD and autism spectrum disorders on temperament, character, and personality development (2006) American Journal of Psychiatry, 163, pp. 1239-1244; Applegate, B., Lahey, B.B., Hart, E.L., Biederman, J., Hynd, G.W., Barkley, R.A., Validity of the age-of-onset criterion for ADHD: a report from the DSM-IV field trials (1997) Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 36, pp. 1211-1221; Barkley, R.A., Against the status quo: revising the diagnostic criteria for ADHD (2010) Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 49, pp. 205-207; Barkley, R.A., Biederman, J., Toward a broader definition of the age-of-onset criterion for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (1997) Journal of American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 36, pp. 1204-1210; Berlin, L., Bohlin, G., Nyberg, L., Janols, L.O., How well do measures of inhibition and other executive functions discriminate between children with ADHD and controls?

Since non-spatial factors such as attentional load have been shown to influence spatial biases in clinical conditions, here we sought to determine whether any association between DAT1 genotype and spatial bias might be moderated by non-spatial attentional load. Healthy adults were asked to react to sudden onset peripheral targets while demand on non-spatial attention was manipulated via a central task. Participants were genotyped for a DAT1 variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism. The 10-repeat allele of this variant is a replicated susceptibility allele for ADHD and has been shown to associate with spatial bias. As expected, an overall leftward asymmetry/pseudoneglect was observed when the data were averaged across the entire sample. When data were stratified by DAT1 genotype, individuals lacking homozygosity for the 10-repeat DAT1 allele (non-10/10) showed a pronounced leftward bias that was significantly different from zero. In line with past reports from children with ADHD, this leftward bias was attenuated in individuals who were homozygous for the DAT1 10-repeat allele (10/10), suggestive of relatively weaker right hemisphere dominance for spatial attention. This effect of DAT1 genotype on spatial bias was not modulated by non-spatial attention load. These data confirm in healthy adult participants both the existence and the direction of the relationship previously reported between DAT1 genotype and spatial bias in children with ADHD. These data add to a growing body of evidence showing that spatial attentional asymmetry is a stable quantitative trait, with individual differences in this trait significantly predicted by common DNA variation in the DAT1 gene. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","DAT1; Dopamine; Hemispheric asymmetry; Individual differences; Pseudoneglect","Bellgrove, M.A., Barry, E., Johnson, K.A., Cox, M., Daibhis, A., Daly, M., Kirley, A., Spatial attentional bias as a marker of genetic risk, symptom severity, and stimulant response in ADHD (2008) Neuropsychopharmacology, 33 (10), pp. 2536-2545; Bellgrove, M.A., Chambers, C.D., Johnson, K.A., Daibhis, A., Daly, M., Hawi, Z., Robertson, I.H., Dopaminergic genotype biases spatial attention in healthy children (2007) Molecular Psychiatry, 12 (8), pp. 786-792; Bellgrove, M.A., Dockree, P.M., Aimola, L., Robertson, I.H., Attenuation of spatial attentional asymmetries with poor sustained attention (2004) Neuroreport, 15 (6), pp. 1065-1069; Bellgrove, M.A., Hawi, Z., Kirley, A., Fitzgerald, M., Gill, M., Robertson, I.H., Association between dopamine transporter (DAT1) genotype, left-sided inattention, and an enhanced response to methylphenidate in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (2005) Neuropsychopharmacology, 30 (12), pp. 2290-2297; Bellgrove, M.A., Hawi, Z., Kirley, A., Gill, M., Robertson, I.H., Dissecting the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) phenotype: sustained attention, response variability and spatial attentional asymmetries in relation to dopamine transporter (DAT1) genotype (2005) Neuropsychologia, 43 (13), pp. 1847-1857; Bellgrove, M.A., Johnson, K.A., Barry, E., Mulligan, A., Hawi, Z., Gill, M., Chambers, C.D., Dopaminergic haplotype as a predictor of spatial inattention in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (2009) Archives of General Psychiatry, 66 (10), pp. 1135-1142; Booth, J.R., Burman, D.D., Meyer, J.R., Lei, Z., Trommer, B.L., Davenport, N.D., Mesulam, M.M., Larger deficits in brain networks for response inhibition than for visual selective attention in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (2005) Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines, 46 (1), pp. 94-111; Bowers, D., Heilman, K.M., Pseudoneglect: effects of hemispace on a tactile line bisection task (1980) Neuropsychologia, 18, pp. 491-498; Bradshaw, J.L., (1989) Hemispheric specialisation and psychological function, , Wiley, New York; Carter, C.S., Krener, P., Chaderjian, M., Northcutt, C., Wolfe, V., Asymmetrical visual-spatial attentional performance in ADHD: evidence for a right hemispheric deficit (1995) Biological Psychiatry, 37 (11), pp. 789-797; Chan, E., Mattingley, J.B., Huang-Pollock, C., English, T., Hester, R., Vance, A., Bellgrove, M.A., Abnormal spatial asymmetry of selective attention in ADHD (2009) Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 50 (9), pp. 1064-1072; Cheon, K.A., Ryu, Y.H., Kim, J.W., Cho, D.Y., The homozygosity for 10-repeat allele at dopamine transporter gene and dopamine transporter density in Korean children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: relating to treatment response to methylphenidate (2005) European Neuropsychopharmacology, 15 (1), pp. 95-101; Ciliax, B.J., Drash, G.W., Staley, J.K., Haber, S., Mobley, C.J., Miller, G.W., Levey, A.I., Immunocytochemical localization of the dopamine transporter in human brain (1999) Journal of Comparative Neurology, 409 (1), pp. 38-56; Colzato, L.S., van den Wildenberg, W.P.M., Van der Does, A.J.W., Hommel, B., Genetic markers of striatal dopamine predict individual differences in dysfunctional, but not functional impulsivity (2010) Neuroscience, 170 (3), pp. 782-788; Corbetta, M., Patel, G., Shulman, G.L., The reorienting system of the human brain: from environment to theory of mind (2008) Neuron, 58 (3), pp. 306-324; Corbetta, M., Shulman, G.L., Spatial neglect and attention networks (2011) Annual Review of Neuroscience, 34 (24), pp. 569-599; Coull, J.T., Frackowiak, R.S.J., Frith, C.D., Monitoring for target objects: activation of right frontal and parietal cortices with increasing time on task (1998) Neuropsychologia, 36 (12), pp. 1325-1334; Culham, J.C., Cavanagh, P., Kanwisher, N.G., Attention response functions: characterizing brain areas using fMRI activation during parametric variations of attentional load (2001) Neuron, 32 (4), pp. 737-745; Dodds, C.M., van Belle, J., Peers, P.V., Dove, A., Cusack, R., Duncan, J., Manly, T., The effects of time-on-task and concurrent cognitive load on normal visuospatial bias (2008) Neuropsychology, 22 (4), pp. 545-552; Driver, J., Mattingley, J.B., Parietal neglect and visual awareness (1998) Nature Neuroscience, 1 (1), pp. 17-22; Ebersbach, G., Trottenberg, T., Hattig, H., Schelosky, L., Schrag, A., Poewe, W., Directional bias of initial visual exploration.

Methods: Seventy patients participated with informed consent. The participants were selected from patients who underwent inpatient treatment in the Department for Addiction at Samsun Neuropsychiatry Hospital. Diagnostic interviews were conducted for cannabis dependence syndrome (ICD 10; DSM-IV); the earliest interview was after 21 days of detoxification therapy. For assesment, the Adult ADD/ADHD DSM IV based Diagnostic Screening and Rating Scale developed by Prof. Dr. Turgay, former Director of the Toronto ADHD Clinic, Ontario, Canada was used. Mean ADHD total and subscale scores were compared by using the group variable independent t test. The analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows 16.00. Results:. Considerably higher scores were observed in cannabis dependent individuals. Twentyfour patients were re-evaluated and interviewed and Adult ADHD was diagnosed. All three subdimensions of the Turgay Adult ADHD Scale were found to be statistically higher in the cannabis dependent patients. Conclusions: As this study shows, Adult ADHD is highly represented in cannabis dependent patients.(in our sample 35% of patients were diagnosed with Adult ADHD). This study underline importance of the ADHD diagnosis in Turkey.","Adult ADHD; Cannabis dependency; Substance use","Kumar, R.N., Chambers, W.A., Pertwee, R.G., Pharmacological actions and therapeutic uses of cannabis and cannabinoids (2001) Anaesthesia, 56, pp. 1059-1068; (2005) The State of Drugs Problem In Europe, , European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), Annual report (2005); (2010) World Drug Report 2010, , WHO, New York, NY World Health Organization; Johns, A., Psychiatric effects of cannabis (2001) British Journal of Psychiatry, 2001 (178), pp. 116-122; Morgenstern, J., Langenbucher, J., Labouvie, E.W., The Generalizability of the Dependence Syndrome Across Substances: An Examination of Some Properties of the Proposed DSM-IV Dependence Criteria (1994) Addiction, 89 (9), pp. 1105-1113. , 1994 Sep; Hall, W., Solowij, N., 11 Long-term cannabis use and mental health (1997) Br J Psychiatry, 171, pp. 107-108; Thomas, H., (1996) A Community Survey of Adverse Effects of Cannabis Use Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 42 (3), pp. 201-207. , Nov 1996; Ögel, K., Uǧuz, Ş., Sir, A., Yenilmez, A., Tamar, D., Çorapçioǧlu, A., Doǧan, O., Liman, O., Türkiye'de Ilköǧretim ve Ortaöǧretim gençliǧi arasi{dotless}nda esrar kullani{dotless}m yaygi{dotless}nli{dotless}ǧi{dotless} (2003) Baǧi{dotless}mli{dotless}li{dotless}k Dergisi, 4, pp. 15-19; Arendt, M., Munk-Jbrgensen, P., Cannabis users seeking treatment: Prevalence of psychiatric disorders (2004) Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, 39, pp. 97-105; Brief treatmentsfor cannabis dependence: Findings from a randomized multisite trial (2004) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 72, pp. 455-466. , The Marihuana Treatment Project Research Group; Dennis, M., Godley, S.H., Diamond, G., Tims, F.M., Babor, T., Donaldson, J., The Cannabis Youth Treatment (CYT study: Main findings from two randomized trials (2004) Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, 27, pp. 197-213; Moore, B.A., Budney, A.J., Relapse in outpatient treatment for marijuana dependence (2003) Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, 25, pp. 85-89; Wilens, T.E., Faraone, S.V., Biederman, J., Gunawardene, S., Does stimulant therapy of attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder beget later substance abuse?

We hypothesized that relatives of bipolar patients would have increased rate of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and subsyndromal manifestations compared to demographically matched relatives of healthy controls. Method. Forty consecutive patients with bipolar disorder were recruited from inpatient and outpatient units of Sisli Etfal Teaching and Research Hospital, Psychiatry Department. Seventy-three first-degree relatives of bipolar disorder group were included. A control group of first-degree relatives of individuals without DSM-IV Axis I psychopathology were also recruited. The Turkish version of the Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Wender Utah Rating Scale, Turgay's Adult ADD/ADHD DSM-IV based Diagnostic and Rating Scale were administered to participants. Results. Overall rate of adult ADHD in RBD group was significantly higher than RC group (9.6 vs. 1.5%; P = 0.04). Participants with adult ADHD in the RBD group had significantly higher rate of alcohol abuse compared to those without adult ADHD (14.3 vs. 1.5%; P = 0.05). Rates of OCD and dysthimia were significantly higher in the subjects with ADHD in the RBD group than the subjects without ADHD (28.6 vs. 4.5%; P = 0.02, 14.3 vs. 1.5%; P = 0.05 respectively). Conclusion. Our findings indicate that relatives of bipolar patients have a risk for suffering from ADHD, and support the hypothesis that relatives of bipolar patients are at a risk for developing attentional and behavioral problems. © 2012 Informa Healthcare.","ADHD; Adult; bipolar disorder; childhood ADHD; familial; relatives","Kent, L., Craddock, N., Is there a relationship between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder?

A number of neuropsychological conditions predisposing and affecting children with learning disorders will be described. Visual processing is the main brain function allowing normal perception of what is being viewed. Ophthalmologists as well as patients must realize that with normal 20/20 eyesight interpretation of what is seen may be dysfunctional because of faulty brain processing of that which is seen by normal eyes. Abnormal Visual Processing as well as auditory processing disorders eventually lead directly to learning disorders in children and young adults. RECENT FINDINGS: New Clinical Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of children with attention deficit disorder (ADD)/attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) have been established by the American Academy of Pediatrics. An overgrowth of neurons in the prefrontal cortex of children with autism has recently been discovered. Six out of 1000 children have been reported as having Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD), which is another name for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A number of alternative treatments for ASD have recently been published. The families of autistic children have increased emotional and financial burdens, often affecting the workplace. SUMMARY: Recent neuropsychology discoveries have helped in the prevention, evaluation and treatment of children with visual processing and learning disorders. Quality-of-life and educational efficiency therefore can be improved. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health.","attention deficit/hyperactive disorder; autism spectrum disorders/pervasive developmental disorder; dyslexia; nonverbal learning disorder; visual and auditory processing/learning disorders","(1995) The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , 4th ed.

One thousand three hundred seventy-two final exams were evaluated covering ten academic quarters, from the Winter 2007 through the Winter 2011. Over this time period, eight different paper colors were used, including seven pastel colors and white. The results show that paper color has no impact on student exam performance and that paper color and student exam performance are independent factors. If we assume that students are motivated to take a final exam and less so to take a quiz, then student motivation (as per Soldat et al. 1997) may be a plausible explanation for the differing results between this study and Fordham and Hayes (2009). The results of this study suggest there may not be a need to restrict the use of pastel paper color on exams, although we describe some evidence and opinions that suggest certain paper colors, including white, may impact those with certain disabilities (i.e., dyslexia, Attention Deficit Disorder [ADD], and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder [ADHD]).

Kurth, 4020 Liège, Belgium","Child psychiatrists have little experience in diagnosing bipolarity. Studies have shown that it takes them an average of about ten years after the initial appearance of the relevant symptoms to arrive at a correct diagnosis. A second set of problems has to do with the still unresolved controversies regarding the nature of the continuum, if any, linking the clinical entities that are manifested in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. In the case of children, for example, comorbidity involving attention disorders with or without hyperactivity (adhd) can be expected to occur with frequency. Nevertheless, the clinical symptomology of adhd, and especially of attention deficits is not familiar to psychiatrists who work with adults. The above reflections suggest the need for studies focusing on the developmental evolution of the relevant semiology, especially since little work has been done to bring together specialists in child and adult psychiatry for this purpose. The present article attempts to fill this need. It also seeks to redress the imbalance due to the fact that most previous studies have been designed solely on the basis of a semiology by category that assembles a set of criteria deemed necessary to obtain a diagnosis and that approaches the clinical symptomology in light of semiological presuppositions that are thought to be identical and are expected to hold in all cases. This article therefore offers a panoramic and detailed presentation of a dimensional and developmental semiology of adhd and bipolarity. The goal of the study presented herein is to identify the clinical symptomologies of bipolarity and adhd with more precision, from early childhood on through adulthood and to refine the relevant differential diagnosis by means of a simultaneous analysis of these two clinical phenomena. The method used in this study is a qualitative one involving the following two steps: first, it examined the relevant phenomena and clinical anamnesis in order to discover the greatest possible number of semiological micro-signs, with the goal of establishing a dimensional semiology. Second, it included subjects of different ages in order to identify a « developmental semiology ». With this intention, we observed 170 children and 55 adults with bipolar symptoms and 14 children and 7 adults with adhd (both sets of subjects had no other comorbidity), attempting to look each time as freshly as possible, without limiting ourselves to the criteria typical of diagnosis by category. For adhd, this study introduces new semiological concepts. These concepts revolve around three distinctions: between (1) a preponderance of divergent attention and a preponderance of convergent attention; between (2) the semiology of pre-attentional difficulties ( relating to ambient noise and excessive information flow ) and the semiol-ogy of attention disorders per se; between (3) simple impulsiveness and an impulsiveness related to disruptive behavior. As a third step, we present the developmental evolution of the relevant clinical phenomena. For bipolarity, the study highlights a « simple manic bipolar temperament » comprising seven semiological axes: Ha« super-energetic » form; 2/ sleep disorders; 31 an « uneasiness in the situation of being alone »;4I « expressive emotional colors »; 5/ excitability, disinhibition, and cravings; 61 a preponderance of divergent attention over convergent attention; 7/ the tendency toward hyperactivity. The description of the clinical symptomol-ogy of « uneasiness in the situation of being alone » - which is the most original aspect of this research - reflects an incapacity to remain alone with oneself in a calm manner. This discomfort is to be distinguished from separation anxiety, though there can be a continuum between the two; it is not a pathognomonic symptom of bipolarity, yet it does seem to be systematically present as a part of it. After having treated bipolarity, we go on to lay out the criteria for the differential diagnosis between « simple manic bipolar temperament » and adhd. At this point, we propose an original classification of bipolar disorders in childhood, made up of three semiological sub-groups of bipolar states, to which we add a fourth semiological group for unipolar depressions. Various comorbidities can enter the scene and modify the basic clinical picture. Lastly, we sketch a differential diagnosis with respect to schizoaffective disorder. In discussing the results presented here, we suggest the possibility of a new « dimensional and developmental nosology ». At the time of this writing, a further stage of the research outlined in this article is underway with the aim of establishing a quantitative analysis of the semiology outlined above.","Attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity (adhd); Bipolarity Unipolar and bipolar depression during infancy; Developmental psychopathology; Developmental semiology from infancy to adulthood; Differential diagnosis; Dimensional semiology","Akiskal, H.S., Maser, J.D., Zeller, P.J., Endicott, J., Coryell, W., Keller, M., Warshaw, M., Goodwin, F., Switching from ""unipolar"" to bipolar II.

Stimulants are considered first-line pharmacological treatment and are the most prescribed treatment for ADHD. However, approximately 30% of children with ADHD do not have an optimal response to a single stimulant and may require adjunctive therapy. Objective: Our objective was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of adding a non-stimulant, guanfacine extended release (GXR), to stimulants versus maintaining existing stimulant monotherapy in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents with suboptimal response to stimulant monotherapy. Methods: A 1-year Markov model was developed to estimate costs and effectiveness from a US third-party payer perspective. Effectiveness was measured by the QALY. The model assumed that patients transitioned among four health states (normal, mild, moderate and severe), defined by the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scale. Transition probabilities were estimated in an ordered logit model using patient-level data from a multicentre, 9-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study, where subjects (n = 461) continued their stable morning stimulant and were randomized to GXR administered in the morning, GXR administered in the evening, or placebo. The model assumed that patients in moderate/severe health states after week 8 would discontinue ADHD treatment and remain in that state for the rest of the study period. Direct costs included drug wholesale acquisition costs and health state costs, all in $US, year 2010 values. Utility associated with each health state was obtained from the literature and disutilities associated with adverse events were applied for the first 4 weeks. Oneway sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted by varying costs, utilities, adverse-event duration, and transition probabilities. Results: Compared with maintaining existing stimulant monotherapy, adding GXR to existing stimulant monotherapy was associated with an incremental drug cost of $US1016 but a lower medical cost of $US124, resulting in a total incremental cost of $US892 at 1 year. The addition of GXR to stimulants led to an incremental QALY of 0.03 and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $US31 660/QALY. In one-way sensitivity analysis, ICER values ranged from $US19 723, when 100%of patients were assumed to be severe in their initial health state, to $US46631, when the last observed states from the clinical trial were carried forward to the end of the 1-year analysis period. PSA demonstrated a 94.6% likelihood that the ICER falls below $US50 000/QALY. Conclusions: The impairment associated with residual ADHD symptoms after stimulant therapy is becoming increasingly recognized. This is the first analysis of the cost effectiveness of stimulants combined with an adjunctive medication. This study suggests that the adjunctive therapy of GXR with stimulants is a cost-effective treatment based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of $US50 000/QALY. This may address an unmet need among patients with suboptimal response to stimulant monotherapy. Adis © 2012 Springer International Publishing AG.

No functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have directly examined fluid reasoning in ADHD which is surprising given that studies demonstrate a consistent network of brain regions involved in fluid reasoning that are also implicated in the pathogenesis of ADHD. Twenty-two right-handed, non-medicated children (12 ADHD, 10 controls) ages 8-12 years completed a fluid reasoning task during which fMRI data were collected. The primary comparison of interest was activation during the fluid reasoning compared to the control condition. Behavioral data showed that children with ADHD tended to be less accurate with faster reaction times in the fluid reasoning condition compared to controls, and were significantly less accurate in the control condition. Controls activated more than participants with ADHD in the right intraparietal sulcus and the left lateral cerebellum in the fluid reasoning condition. Results showed hypoactivation in ADHD in regions critical for fluid reasoning. These results add to the literature suggesting a role for parietal and cerebellar regions in cognition and ADHD. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Method: Parents of children with and without ADHD and seven medical and nonmedical professional groups (N = 673) completed a questionnaire examining their beliefs about the efficacy of various treatment regimes. Results: Principle component analysis identified four factors-school-based interventions, medical and allied health interventions, parent interventions, and nontraditional interventions. Although there were some group differences in the level of endorsement for these factors, there was a high degree of concordance between the groups. The school-based interventions factor was the most highly endorsed, whereas the nontraditional interventions factor was the least endorsed by the sample as a whole. Conclusion: The results suggest that the low level of interdisciplinary interaction that has been reported in the literature is not due to differences in beliefs about the efficacy of various treatment strategies for ADHD. © 2012 SAGE Publications.","ADD/ADHD; beliefs; multidisciplinary communication; social cognition; treatment","Clinical practice guidelines: Treatment of the school-aged child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (2001) Pediatrics, 108, pp. 1033-1044; (2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , (4th ed., text rev.).

Limited research, however, is available concerning the mechanisms and processes that contribute to impulsive responding by children with ADHD. The current study tested predictions from two competing models of ADHD - working memory (WM) and behavioral inhibition (BI) - to examine the extent to which ADHD-related impulsive responding was attributable to model-specific mechanisms and processes. Children with ADHD (n021) and typically developing children (n020) completed laboratory tasks that provided WM (domain-general central executive [CE], phonological/visuospatial storage/rehearsal) and BI indices (stop-signal reaction time [SSRT], stop-signal delay, mean reaction time). These indices were examined as potential mediators of ADHD-related impulsive responding on two objective and diverse laboratory tasks used commonly to assess impulsive responding (CPT: continuous performance test; VMTS: visual match-to-sample). Bias-corrected, bootstrapped mediation analyses revealed that CE processes significantly attenuated between-group impulsivity differences, such that the initial large-magnitude impulsivity differences were no longer significant on either task after accounting for ADHD-related CE deficits. In contrast, SSRT partially mediated ADHD-related impulsive responding on the CPT but not VMTS. This partial attenuation was no longer significant after accounting for shared variance between CE and SSRT; CE continued to attenuate the ADHD-impulsivity relationship after accounting for SSRT. These findings add to the growing literature implicating CE deficits in core ADHD behavioral and functional impairments, and suggest that cognitive interventions targeting CE rather than storage/rehearsal or BI processes may hold greater promise for alleviating ADHDrelated impairments. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","ADHD; Behavioral inhibition; Commission errors; Executive functions; Impulsive responding .Working memory","Achenbach, T.M., Rescorla, L.A., (2001) Manual for the ASEBA School-age Forms & Profiles, , Burlington: University of Vermont Research Center for Children, Youth, & Families; Ackerman, P.L., Beier, M.E., Boyle, M.O., Working memory and intelligence: The same or different constructs?

The existence of unique large size families linked to multiple regions, and the fact that these families came from an isolated population, we hypothesized that two-locus interaction contributions to ADHD were plausible. Several analytical models converged to show significant interaction between 4q and 11q (P&lt;1 × 10 -8) and 11q and 17p (P&lt;1 × 10 -6). As we have identified that common variants of the LPHN3 gene were responsible for the 4q linkage signal, we focused on 4q-11q interaction to determine that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) harbored in the LPHN3 gene interact with SNPs spanning the 11q region that contains DRD2 and NCAM1 genes, to double the risk of developing ADHD. This interaction not only explains genetic effects much better than taking each of these loci effects by separated but also differences in brain metabolism as depicted by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy data and pharmacogenetic response to stimulant medication. These findings not only add information about how high order genetic interactions might be implicated in conferring susceptibility to develop ADHD but also show that future studies of the effects of genetic interactions on ADHD clinical information will help to shape predictive models of individual outcome. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","ADHD;

It can be especially disruptive if the patient were a child. Although the exact regimen prescribed is adjusted on a case-to-case basis, the most effective treatment often involves a combination of medicines and behavioral therapies. Medbuddy is a mobile medication management system designed to improve young patients' compliance to the prescription instructions, while attempting to affect positive changes in their behaviors by establishing structured and consistent daily routines and providing both positive and negative feedbacks. By providing timely reminders when it's time to take medications, establishing a reward schedule to reinforce positive behaviors, and interacting with child patients with a configurable avatar, Medbuddy is designed to be an agent of fun that combines medicinal and behavioral treatments to make ADD/ADHD child patients better so they may develop their full potentials. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","ADD/ADHD; behavior reinforce; children; healthcare; medication; mobile application; motivation","Callaghan, T.O., For ADHD, Rewards Function Similarly to Drugs, , http://alturl.com/kj2tk; (2011) Mobile Playgrounds: Kids, Families and Mobile Play, , http://playsciencelab.com/, October; Reisser, P.C., Dobson, J., (2007) Baby & Child Care, pp. 379-386. , Tyndale House Publisher; MedCoach - Easy Medication Management with Reminders, Compliance Tracker, and Drug Lookup Database, , http://tinyurl.com/6qouf32, GreatCall, Inc; Touch Pet Dogs 2, , http://tinyurl.com/3aetnd3, Ngmoco, LLC",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862202604

High maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) has been shown to predict child ADHD symptoms, however the neurocognitive processes underlying this relationship are not known. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that this association is mediated by alterations in child executive function. Methodology/Principal Findings: A population-based cohort of 174 children (mean age = 7.3±0.9 (SD) yrs, 55% girls) was evaluated for ADHD symptoms using the Child Behavior Checklist, and for neurocognitive function using the Go/No-go task. This cohort had been followed prospectively from early gestation and birth through infancy and childhood with serial measures of maternal and child prenatal and postnatal factors. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was a significant predictor of child ADHD symptoms (F(1,158) = 4.80, p = 0.03) and of child performance on the Go/No-go task (F(1,157) = 8.37, p = 0.004) after controlling for key potential confounding variables. A test of the mediation model revealed that the association between higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and child ADHD symptoms was mediated by impaired executive function (inefficient/less attentive processing; Sobel Test: t = 2.39 (±0.002, SEM), p = 0.02). Conclusions/Significance: To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report that maternal pre-pregnancy BMI-related alterations in child neurocognitive function may mediate its effects on ADHD risk. The finding is clinically significant and may extrapolate to an approximately 2.8-fold increase in the prevalence of ADHD among children of obese compared to those of non-obese mothers. These results add further evidence to the growing awareness that neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD may have their foundations very early in life. © 2012 Buss et al.",,"Pastor, P.N., Reuben, C.A., Diagnosed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and learning disability: United States, 2004-2006 (2008) Vital Health Stat, 10, pp. 1-14;

Abundant evidence from follow-up studies accumulated since the 1970s supports the concept of ADHD in adulthood. Genetic research points to a heritability of 76%, and neuroimaging studies have reported structural and functional brain abnormalities in patients with ADHD. Contrary to popular belief, ADHD is not a culturally bound disorder and has been described worldwide. ADHD has a cost for society, as adults with this disorder suffer from increased rates of unemployment and psychiatric comorbidity, including substance use disorders. Studies undertaken in forensic populations describe high rates of ADHD in these groups, particularly amongst young offenders. One of the main issues in the diagnosis of ADHD in the adult is the fact that most clinicians have not been educated to diagnose and treat ADHD. Effective pharmacological treatments for ADHD are available and should be prescribed for these patients. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) guidelines established a benchmark for service development required to treat ADHD adequately in the adult population. However, the implementation of new services has been slow. More resources are needed to effectively assess and treat ADHD in the adult. © The Author(s) 2012.","ADD; ADHD; drug treatment; hyperactivity; hyperkinetic disorder; inattention; methylphenidate; service provision","Adler, L.A., Spencer, T.J., Levine, L.R., Functional outcomes in the treatment of adults with ADHD (2008) J Atten Disord, 11, pp. 720-727; Arcos-Burgos, M., Jain, M., Acosta, M.T., Common variant of the latrophilin 3 gene, LPHN3, confers susceptibility to ADHD and predicts effectiveness of stimulant medication (2010) Mol Psychiatry, 15, pp. 1053-1066; Arias, A.J., Gelernter, J., Chan, G., Weiss, R.D., Brady, K.T., Farrer, L., Kranzler, H.R., Correlates of co-occurring ADHD in drug-dependent subjects: Prevalence and features of substance dependence and psychiatric disorders (2008) Addict Behav, 33, pp. 1199-1207; Asherson, P., Clinical assessment and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults (2005) Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics, 5, pp. 525-539; Biederman, J., Faraone, S.V., Keenan, K., Further evidence for family-genetic risk factors in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

The core symptoms include pervasive inattention and inappropriate levels of hyperactivity-impulsivity. High-frequency gamma activity has been implicated in the temporal binding of stimulus properties across cortical areas, and is known to be crucial for complex information processing and attentional processes in particular. Thus, we evaluated the amplitude of gamma-frequency neural responses in adults with and those without ADHD, and tested whether stimulant medications, the most common treatment for ADHD, modulate gamma activity in affected adults. Participants underwent two sessions (∼75 min apart) of auditory stimulation using stimuli known to elicit 40 Hz gamma-band responses as magnetoencephalography data were acquired. Between sessions, the ADHD group (who were in maintenance therapy) were administered their daily stimulant medication and both groups were told to relax. The primary results indicated that gamma activity was weaker in the ADHD group during session one (pre-drug), but not session two (post-drug), and that gamma activity significantly increased following stimulant administration in adults with ADHD. These results suggest that ADHD is associated with reduced cortical gamma activity and that stimulants may ameliorate this abnormality. © The Author(s) 2012.","40 Hz; ADD; Adderall; ADHD; attention; magnetoencephalography; stimulant","Barry, R.J., Clarke, A.R., Hajos, M., McCarthy, R., Selikowitz, M., Bruggemann, J.M., Acute atomoxetine effects on the EEG of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (2009) Neuropharmacology, 57, pp. 702-707; Barry, R.J., Clarke, A.R., Hajos, M., McCarthy, R., Selikowitz, M., Dupuy, F.E., Resting-state EEG gamma activity in children with Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (2010) Clin Neurophysiol, 121, pp. 1871-1877; Barry, R.J., Clarke, A.R., Johnstone, S.J., A review of electrophysiology in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: I.

This is a particularly important topic in an era characterized by powerful circulating discourses around the contentious medicalization of, and prevalent pharmaceutical treatments for, ADD/ADHD, as well as the mother blame associated with having a child diagnosed with ADD/ADHD. The findings document that the mothers see ADD/ADHD as legitimate medical diagnoses and view themselves as caretakers of children with brain and neuro-chemical anomalies affecting the behavior of their children. They favor pharmaceutical use and describe themselves as experts in the difficult and complex issues related to pharmaceuticalized parenting. At the same time their adoption of medicalization is contingent as they express specific critiques of some doctors, some types of doctors, and critically evaluate science. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","ADD/ADHD; intensive; Internet blogs; medication; mothering","Ainsworth, S., Hardy, C., Critical discourse analysis and identity: Why bother?

Method: The authors screened for childhood and adult ADHD symptoms and administered the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III (MCMI-III) to 196 serving prisoners. Results: Childhood and adult ADHD symptoms were most strongly related to the compulsive (negative relationship) and borderline (positive relationship) scales on the MCMI-III with large and medium effect sizes, respectively. Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that the absence of compulsive personality disorder traits (i.e., a low score as a dimension) was the single best Axis II predictor of childhood and adult ADHD symptoms. CSs did not add significantly to the variance in childhood ADHD beyond that of the personality disorder dimensions, but it did so for current ADHD symptoms in relation to alcohol dependence. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the relative absence of compulsive personality disorder traits in prisoners with ADHD symptoms as core maladaptive traits involving disorganization. © 2012 SAGE Publications.","ADHD; Alcohol dependence; Disorganized personality traits; Maladaptive traits; Personality disorders","(2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, (4th Ed., Text Rev.)

There is growing recognition that children's behavior varies meaningfully across situations, and evidence indicates that these differences, in combination with informants' unique perspectives, are at least partly responsible for inter-rater discrepancies in reports of symptomatology. Such data suggest that we should embrace this contextual variability as clinically meaningful information, moving away from models of psychopathology as generalized traits that manifest uniformly across situations and settings, and toward theoretical conceptualizations that explicitly incorporate contextual features, such as considering clinical syndromes identified by different informants to be discrete phenomena. We highlight different approaches to measurement that embrace contextual variability in children's behavior and describe how the use of such tools and techniques may yield significant gains clinically (e.g., for treatment planning and monitoring). The continued development of a variety of feasible, contextually sensitive methods for assessing children's behavior will allow us to determine further the validity of incorporating contextual features into models of developmental psychopathology and nosological frameworks. © 2012 The Authors.

Building on recent promising results from general samples of high school students (undifferentiated by academically at-risk sub-groups within them) and dominant models of attention and executive functioning, the present study examines the potential of personal best (PB) goals for students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The study focuses on N=87 students with ADHD and N=3374 non-ADHD peers from the same schools and year levels - in addition to a supplementary analysis of a randomly drawn non-ADHD sub-sample of N=87 and a second supplementary analysis controlling for achievement. Multi-group multivariate path analyses demonstrated (a) significant and positive associations between PB goals and academic outcomes (achievement and behavioral engagement) for students with ADHD, (b) similar positive effects for non-ADHD students (N=3374), (d) replicated results with the randomly drawn non-ADHD sub-sample (N=87), (e) similar findings when controlling for achievement, and (f) absolute parameter estimates that trended larger for students with ADHD than non-ADHD students. These findings indicate that the positive role of PB goals may generalize across diverse student groups and that there appears to be merit in broadly promoting PB goals amongst ADHD (and, potentially, other academically at-risk students) and non-ADHD students alike. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..","Achievement; ADD; ADHD; Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; Engagement; Goals; Personal best (PB) goals","Abikoff, H.B., Jensen, P.S., Arnold, L.E., Hoza, B., Hechtman, L., Pollack, S., Observed classroom behavior of children with ADHD: Relationship to gender and comorbidity (2002) Journal of Abnormal Child Psychopathology, 30, pp. 349-360; (2000) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, revised, , APA, Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association; (2007) APA dictionary of psychology, , American Psychological Association, Washington, DC, American Psychological Association; Anderman, E., Patrick, H., Achievement goal theory, Conceptualization of ability/intelligence, and classroom climate (in press).

The continuous performance test (CPT) is the most frequently used direct measure of inattention and impulsivity. This meta-analysis compared CPT performance between boys and girls with and without ADHD. Method: All peer-reviewed ADHD studies published between 1980 and 2010 that used a CPT and enabled gender comparison were included. Gender differences in commission (impulsivity) and omission (inattention) errors were analyzed. Results: Included studies comprised a sample of 772 boys and 325 girls with ADHD. Findings show that boys were significantly more impulsive than girls, but no difference with inattention was found. Within-gender analysis revealed that the difference among boys with and without ADHD was significantly larger than the difference among girls with and without ADHD. Conclusion: The results indicate that gender is a significant moderating factor in the assessment of core ADHD symptoms when using CPTs. © 2012 SAGE Publications.","ADD/ADHD; gender; inattention; response inhibition","(1980) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, (3rd ed.).

Genetic factors are consistently shown to explain a significant proportion of variance in measures of ADHD. The current study adds to this body of research by examining whether genetic liabilities for criminality and alcoholism have effects on the development of ADHD symptomatologies. Analyses based on a sample of adoptees drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) revealed that ADHD symptomatologies were elevated among adoptees who had biological mothers and fathers who had been arrested or who were alcoholics. These results suggest that part of the covariation between ADHD and antisocial behaviors may be the result of genetic factors that have general effects across a range of maladaptive outcomes. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","ADHD; Adoption; Alcoholism; Criminality; Genetics","Faraone, S.V., Doyle, A.E., Mick, E., Biederman, J., Meta-analysis of the association between the 7-repeat allele of the dopamine D 4 receptor gene and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (2001) American Journal of Psychiatry, 158 (7), pp. 1052-1057. , DOI 10.1176/appi.ajp.158.7.1052; Merikangas, K.R., He, J.-P., Brody, D., Fisher, P.W., Bourdon, K., Koretz, D.S., Prevalence and treatment of mental disorders among US children in the 2001-2004 NHANES (2010) Pediatrics, 125, pp. 75-81. , 20008426 10.1542/peds.2008-2598; Visser, S.N., Bitsko, R.H., Danielson, M.L., Perou, R., Blumberg, S.J., Increasing prevalence of parent-reported attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder among children-United States, 2003 and 2007 (2010) MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 59, pp. 1439-1443; Jensen, P.S., Martin, D., Cantwell, D.P., Comorbidity in ADHD: Implications for research, practice, and DSM-V (1997) Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 36 (8), pp. 1065-1079; Holmes, J., Payton, A., Barrett, J., Harrington, R., McGuffin, P., Owen, M., Ollier, W., Thapar, A., Association of DRD4 in children with ADHD and comorbid conduct problems (2002) American Journal of Medical Genetics - Neuropsychiatric Genetics, 114 (2), pp. 150-153. , DOI 10.1002/ajmg.10149; Mannuzza, S., Klein, R.G., Moulton, J.L., Lifetime criminality among boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: A prospective follow-up study into adulthood using official arrest records (2008) Psychiatr Res, 160, pp. 237-246. , 10.1016/j.psychres.2007.11.003; Albayrak, O., Friedel, S., Schimmelmann, B.G., Hinney, A., Hebebrand, J., Genetic aspects in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (2008) J Neural Transm, 115, pp. 305-315. , 18200432 10.1007/s00702-007-0839-9; Schilling, C.M., Walsh, A., Yun, I., ADHD and criminality: A primer on the genetic, neurobiological, evolutionary, and treatment literature for criminologists (2011) J Crim Justice, 39, pp. 3-11. , 10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2010.11.001; Biederman, J., Wilens, T., Mick, E., Milberger, S., Spencer, T.J., Faraone, S.V., Psychoactive substance use disorders in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): Effects of ADHD and psychiatric comorbidity (1995) Am J Psychiatry, 152, pp. 1652-1658. , 7485630; Chilcoat, H.D., Breslau, N., Pathways from ADHD to early drug use (1999) Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 38 (11), pp. 1347-1354; Rasmussen, K., Levander, S., Untreated ADHD in adults: Are there sex differences in symptoms, comorbidity, and impairment?

Advances in genomic medicine and neuroimaging are knocking on the door of clinicians. In October of 2010, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry held its 57th Meeting in New York. One of the most important aspects discussed was the incorporation of new clinical diagnoses to the new DSM-5 classification (fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). The concepts inherent to the ADHD definition are currently being revised. In 2012, the next classification of the American Academy of Psychiatry will include a new subtype of ADHD, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: Inattentive Presentation (Restrictive). Also, one of the main goals of the new classification is to identify the different subtypes of ADHD with unique clinical, neuroimaging, and genetic features, which may lead to specific treatments. Currently, the diagnosis is mostly clinical; however, future developments will lead to optimization of the diagnosis of ADHD and its subtypes. © 1997 Pediatria Catalana.","Add; Adhd; Attention deficit; Hyperactivity disorder","Clemens, S.D., Peters, E., Minimal brain dysfunctions in the school age child (1962) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 6, pp. 185-197; Goodman, R., Stevenson, J., A twin study of hyperactivity.

Present study investigated actual prevalence of ADHD and comorbid disorders among university students in Cumhuriyet University of Sivas in Turkey. Methods: In the first stage, 980 university students filled in the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale and socio-demographic form, 79 of whom were above the cut-off score of Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, considered as possible ADHD. They were evaluated in the second stage via structured interview SCID I, SCID II, Adult ADHD Module of MINI Plus. In addition, subjects filled in the self report Adult ADD/ADHD DSM IV-Based Diagnostic Screening and Rating Scale. Results: The self report ADHD prevalence rate was 10.1% and the actual prevalence rate of ADHD among the university students was calculated 6.1%. The prevalence of ADHD was greater among male than female (7.0% vs. 5.5%). Among the male students inattentive subtype was 1.6%, hyperactive-impulsive 0.24%, combined 5.1%. Female students were found to be inattentive by 1.45%, hyperactive-impulsive by 0.56% and combined type by 3.48%. Most of the students with ADHD had Axis I (especially depressive disorders) and Axis II disorders (especially cluster B personality disorders). ADHD diagnosis was associated with more cigarette and alcohol use, academic failure, legal problems, somatic complaints and suicide attempts. Students with ADHD were spending more time on the Internet than students without ADHD. Only one student diagnosed with ADHD reported to have had previous ADHD diagnosis. Conclusions: ADHD is common among university students. Having a diagnosis of ADHD in early adulthood seems to be associated with psychological, social, and academic problems.","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; Co-morbidity; College students; Prevalence","(2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, Fourth Edition, Text Revision.

The child's mother reported a history of hyperactivity, inability to self-regulate/focus attention, impulsivity, self injury and behaviorally disinhibition. The goal was to enable the child to achieve a better brain regulation, leading to improvements in attention, mood, and social behavior. The sensors were placed on the scalp and connected to the computer software that detects specific neuronal activity. The subject showed an improvement in emotional reaction, a reduction in self injuries and oppositional behavior, and a better social relationship. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","ADD/ADHD; Cognitive psycology; EEG training; Neurofeedback; Neuroscience","Mann, C.A., Lubar, J.F., Zimmerman, A.W., Miller, C.A., Muenchen, R.A., Quantitative analysis of EEG in boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Controlled study with clinical implications (1992) Pediatric Neurology, 8, pp. 30-36; Steinberg, M., Siegfried, O., (2004) Add: The 20-hour Solution, , Bandon, OR: Robert Reed Publishers; Zametkin, A.J., Nordahl, T.E., Gross, M., King, A.C., Semple, W.E., Rumsey, J., Cerebral glucose metabolism in adults with hyperactivity of childhood onset (1990) New England Journal of Medicine, 323, pp. 1361-1366",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858428198

Although much evidence supports the use of psychostimulants as a first-line treatment in children and adolescents, up to 30% of patients may have an inadequate response to these medications. For these patients, addition of an ?2-adrenoceptor agonist can further improve ADHD symptoms. The ?2-adrenoceptor agonists may work in a synergistic fashion with stimulants through regulation of prefrontal cortex function. Early studies were completed with immediate-release clonidine (CLON-IR), which requires multiple daily doses and achieves a higher maximum concentration more rapidly than the more recently developed extended-release clonidine (CLON-XR). Pharmacokinetic properties of CLON-XR may be responsible for differences in efficacy and tolerability between the CLON-IR and CLON-XR formulations. Recent double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have shown that extended-release α2- adrenoceptor agonists are safe and effective, both as monotherapy and as adjunctive treatment with stimulants. This review will focus on clonidine used in conjunction with stimulants to optimize treatment of ADHD. Copyright © 2012 Prous Science, S.A.U. or its licensors.

In North America, psychostimulants (amphetamine and methylphenidate) are considered first-line pharmacological treatments for patients (children, adolescents and adults) with ADHD. However, in the UK, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines have placed short-acting d-amphetamine as a third-line treatment option due to a lack of contemporary, published clinical trials on its efficacy and the concerns from clinical and patient experts regarding the potential for increased abuse andor misuse compared with methylphenidate. These guidelines do not account for some of the more recent amphetamine products that have been developed to alleviate some of these concerns, but that are not currently approved in the UK or other European countries. The purpose of this review is to describe the pharmacology and clinical efficacy of various amphetamine compositions, as well as to explore the apparent differences in these compositions and their associated risks and benefits. A PubMed literature search was conducted to investigate amphetamine pharmacology, clinical efficacy and safety and ADHD outcomes in the published literature from 1980 through March 2011. Search terms included the keywords 'ADHD' or 'ADD' or 'hyperkinetic disorder' and any of the following keywords combined with 'or': 'amphetamine', 'dexamphetamine', 'mixed amphetamine salts', 'lisdexamfetamine' and 'methamphetamine'. The search included English-language primary research articles and review articles but excluded editorial articles and commentaries. The literature search resulted in 330 articles. Pertinent articles relating to amphetamine pharmacology, compositions, clinical efficacy and safety, effectiveness and tolerability, ADHD outcomes and abuse liability were included in this review. The different delivery profiles of amphetamine compositions result in pharmacological and pharmacokinetic differences that contribute to varying effects in the clinical treatment of ADHD, ADHD outcomes and abuse liability. The efficacy and safety of amphetamine compositions for the treatment of ADHD have been demonstrated in clinical trials and meta-analyses, and the long-acting amphetamine compositions have been widely studied and found efficacious without increased adverse effects. Long-acting amphetamine compositions offer the obvious advantage of enhanced duration of action over short-acting amphetamine compositions, and lisdexamfetamine has been shown to have reduced abuse liability compared with short-acting amphetamine. © 2012 Adis Data Information BV.

Symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have also been shown to increase smoking risk and may moderate the relationship between genotype and smoking. We conducted an exploratory study to assess whether ADHD symptoms interact with genetic variation to predict self-reported initial reactions to smoking. Methods: Participants were a subsample of 1,900 unrelated individuals with genotype data drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a nationally representative sample of adolescents followed from 1995 to 2002. Linear regression was used to examine relationships among self-reported ADHD symptoms, genotype, and self-reported initial reactions to cigarettes (index scores reflecting pleasant and unpleasant reactions). Results: Polymorphisms in the DRD2 gene, SLC6A4 gene, and among males, the MAOA gene interacted with retrospective reports of ADHD symptoms in predicting pleasant initial reaction to cigarettes. Polymorphisms in the CYP2A6 gene and, among females, the MAOA gene interacted with retrospective reports of ADHD symptoms in predicting unpleasant initial reaction to cigarettes. No main effect for any of these polymorphisms was observed nor were any interactions with DRD4 and DAT genes. Conclusions: These findings suggest that genotypes associated with monoamine neurotransmission interact with ADHD symptoms to influence initial reactions to cigarette smoking. Given that an initial pleasant reaction to cigarettes increases risk for lifetime smoking, these results add to a growing body of literature that suggests that ADHD symptoms increase risk for smoking and should be accounted for in genetic studies of smoking. © The Author 2011.

The first patient remained stable for many years with this combination treatment, whereas the second became psychotic several months after he had increased the dose of methylphenidate and had started to use cocaine. In the light of these two case studies, we have reviewed the literature on ADD psychosis, and we formulate recommendations regarding the specialised treatment needed for this uncommon disorder.","ADD psychosis; ADHD; Schizophrenia","Bellak, L., An idiosyncratic overview (1979) Disorders of the Schizophrenic Syndrome, pp. 3-22. , Bellak L, red.

Resulting problems vary on a continuum of severity but commonly involve structural and functional brain abnormalities resulting in problems with academic performance, ADD/ADHD, information processing, math performance, memory, social skills, and increased rates of psychopathology, all of which generally persist into adulthood. This article presents the first uncontrolled case report of neurofeedback treatment of an FASD case on the milder end of this spectrum, which resulted in significant behavioral and academic improvements that were sustained on follow-up at 42 months.

After this, solid impurities were removed by Gravity Filtration while the solvent (DCM) was removed by Steam Distillation at 200°c. the crude caffeine was obtained and it has to be confirmed with two chemical tests as Murexide Identification Test - murexoin purple colour formation; caffeine salicylate formation &amp; collection by vacuum filtration - melting point, 137°c was checked via Mel - Temp apparatus. After confirmatory test, the crude caffeine has to be purified by vacuum sublimation at 190°c where the caffeine sublimes at 178°c and melts at 238°c which was checked by, Mel - Temp apparatus. To assess the purity of caffeine, crude caffeine, sublimed caffeine and standard caffeine samples were subjected to TLC analysis and it was determined by calculating their R f, values and comparing them with standard R f, value range of caffeine, 0.3 - 0.7. the quantification of extracted caffeine was estimated by, UV - Vis spectrophotometric method at 274 nm, by calibrating a graphical representation of the O.D values recorded. We conclude that, many ADD/ADHD people function well enough using caffeine to make it through life. They can easily afford the cost of caffeine and avoid paying for expensive ADD/ADHD prescription drugs. Also, their use of caffeine does not have to be supervised by a health professional. Importantly, for some, ADD/ADHD caffeine users do not have to carry the burden of the diagnosis of having a mental disorder.","Gravity filtration; Mel- temperature; Murexide identification test; Steam distillation; TLC","Murray, S.D., Hansen, P.J., Hampp, A., (1996) Journal of Chemistry Education, 73, p. 1172; Tice, R., Brigette Brevard, M.A., Caffeine and its modulating effects (1999) Integrated Laboratory Systems (ILS); Fall, Daily Log For Chemistry/Detector Portion of Medicinal Plants of the Southwest (2003) Journal of Health Science, 51, pp. 347-359; Prediger, R.D., Caffeine improves spatial learning deficits in an animal model of ADHD - the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) (2005) The International Journal of Neuropaychopharmacology, 8, pp. 583-594; John, R., Extraction and Isolution of Caffeine from Tea leaves (2009) Journal of Natural Science, 77, pp. 158-198; Yoshino, K., Antioxidative activities of low - caffeine Extract Prepared from Green Tea leaves (2010) Journal of Technology and Education, 17 (1), pp. 17-24",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861949610

Segmentation methods based on a single atlas or on multiple atlases have been shown to suitably localize caudate structure. However, the atlas prior information may not represent the structure of interest correctly. It may therefore be useful to introduce a more flexible technique for accurate segmentations.Method: We present Cau-dateCut: a new fully-automatic method of segmenting the caudate nucleus in MRI. CaudateCut combines an atlas-based segmentation strategy with the Graph Cut energy-minimization framework. We adapt the Graph Cut model to make it suitable for segmenting small, low-contrast structures, such as the caudate nucleus, by defining new energy function data and boundary potentials. In particular, we exploit information concerning the intensity and geometry, and we add supervised energies based on contextual brain structures. Furthermore, we reinforce boundary detection using a new multi-scale edgeness measure.Results: We apply the novel CaudateCut method to the segmentation of the caudate nucleus to a new set of 39 pediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients and 40 control children, as well as to a public database of 18 subjects. We evaluate the quality of the segmentation using several volumetric and voxel by voxel measures. Our results show improved performance in terms of segmentation compared to state-of-the-art approaches, obtaining a mean overlap of 80.75%. Moreover, we present a quantitative volumetric analysis of caudate abnormalities in pediatric ADHD, the results of which show strong correlation with expert manual analysis.Conclusion: CaudateCut generates segmentation results that are comparable to gold-standard segmentations and which are reliable in the analysis of differentiating neuroanatomical abnormalities between healthy controls and pediatric ADHD. © 2011 Igual et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Atlas-based strategy; Brain caudate nucleus; Graph cut framework; Mri; Segmentation","Carmona, S., Vilarroya, O., Bielsa, A., Trèmols, V., Soliva, J.C., Rovira, M., Tomàs, J., Bulbena, A., Global and regional gray matter reductions in ADHD: A voxel-based morphometric study (2005) Neuroscience Letters, 389 (2), pp. 88-93. , 10.1016/j.neulet.2005.07.020, 16129560; Filipek, P.A., Semrud-Clikeman, M., Steingard, R.J., Renshaw, P.F., Kennedy, D.N., Biederman, J., Volumetric MRI analysis comparing subjects having attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder with normal controls (1997) Neurology, 48 (3), pp. 589-601; Reiss, A., Abrams, M., Singer, H., Ross, J., Denckla, M., Brain development, gender and IQ in children.

This has been found to be particularly true for predominantly inattentive pupils. This paper aimed to establish the relative importance of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity to the academic progress of young children. A large dataset which held children's reading and maths attainment at the end of their first year at school, as well as teachers' ratings of ADHD-related behaviours based on the DSM-IV criteria was analysed. Inattention was strongly linked to under-attainment whilst impulsivity was positively related to attainment for similar levels of inattention. The item ""Blurts out answers"" on the teachers' rating scale was particularly important. When impulsivity acted as an overt sign of cognitive engagement it seemed to have a positive function. This raises questions about the inclusion of the ""blurting out"" item in the ADHD DSM criteria. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","ADD/ADHD; Attention; Impulsivity; Mathematics; Reading","(1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, American Psychiatric Association, Washington D.C; Barkley, R.A., Delayed responding and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Toward a unified theory (1994) Disruptive behaviour disorders in children: Essays in honour of Herbert Quay, pp. 11-57. , Plenum, New York, D.K.

ADHD affects up to 1 in 20 children in the United States. The underlying etiologies of ADHD may be heterogeneous and diverse, and many possible risk factors in the development of ADHD have been identified. Conventional treatment usually consists of behavioral accommodations and medication, with stimulant medication most commonly being prescribed. Parents concerned about the side effects and long-term use of conventional medications are increasingly seeking alternatives to pharmacologic treatment. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) offers parents various treatment options for this condition, including dietary modifications, nutritional supplementation, herbal medicine, and homeopathy. CAM appears to be most effective when prescribed holistically and according to each individual's characteristic symptoms. Possible etiologies and risk factors for the condition also need to be considered when developing a treatment plan. This article serves to highlight the latest research regarding the most commonly used CAM for children with ADHD. Copyright © 2011 Alternative Medicine Review, LLC.

Ltd., Nutrition Division, Yokkaichi, Mie, Japan","INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of L-theanine as an aid to the improvement of objectively measured sleep quality in a population of 98 male children formally diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted involving boys, ages 8-12 years, who had been previously diagnosed with ADHD. An experienced physician confirmed the diagnosis of ADHD in each subject. Randomization was stratified based upon current use of stimulant medication to ensure an equal distribution of stimulant/non-stimulant treated subjects into active and placebo treated groups. Participants consumed two chewable tablets twice daily (at breakfast and after school), with each tablet containing 100 mg of L-theanine (total 400 mg daily Suntheanine®, Taiyo Kagaku, Yokkaichi, Japan) or identical tasting chewable placebo for six weeks. Subjects were evaluated for five consecutive nights using wrist actigraphy at baseline, and again at the end of the six-week treatment period. The Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) was completed by parents at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. RESULTS: Actigraph watch data findings indicated that boys who consumed L-theanine obtained significantly higher sleep percentage and sleep efficiency scores, along with a non-significant trend for less activity during sleep (defined as less time awake after sleep onset) compared to those in the placebo group. Sleep latency and other sleep parameters were unchanged. The PSQ data did not correlate significantly to the objective data gathered from actigraphy, suggesting that parents were not particularly aware of their children's sleep quality. L-theanine at relatively high doses was well tolerated with no significant adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that 400 mg daily of L-theanine is safe andeffective in improving some aspects of sleep quality in boys diagnosed with ADHD. Since sleep problems are a common co-morbidity associated with ADHD, and because disturbed sleep may be linked etiologically to this disorder, L-theanine may represent a safe and important adjunctive therapy in childhood ADHD. Larger, long-term studies looking at the wider therapeutic role of this agent in this population are warranted. Copyright © 2011 Alternative Medicine Review, LLC.

The aim of this paper was to report research findings on children with ADHD and typically developing children in relation to preference of play partners, play places, toys and type of play. Methods: Thirty-two school aged children from low socioeconomic status were divided into two groups. One group of 16 children with ADHD were matched with 16 typically developing children. Results and conclusion: There were no significant differences between the two groups in relation to play partners, with classmates being the most frequent play partner for both groups. There were significant differences between the two groups in preferred place to play. Children with ADHD preferred to play in school and typically developing children preferred to play on the street. There were significant differences in relation to toys and type of play engaged in with children with ADHD preferring educational materials and typically developing children preferring electronic games. These findings add to knowledge of Brazilian children with ADHD and their play preferences. Comparisons are made with research with Australian children with and without ADHD. © 2011 The Authors.

While childhood symptoms (especially hyperactivity) decline as a function of age, functional impairments increase in adolescence. Academic, social, and family domains are the three most impaired domains of functioning. Oppositional defiant disorder, mood disorder, and substance use disorders are common psychiatric comorbidities in adolescent ADHD. Treatments for adolescent ADHD include medication and psychosocial interventions. Relative to childhood ADHD, far less is known about ADHD in adolescence. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

OCD is probably an etiologically heterogeneous condition. Individuals with OCD frequently have additional psychiatric disorders concomitantly or at some time during their lifetime. Recently, some authors proposed an OCD sub-classification based on comorbidity. An important issue in assessing comorbidity is the fact that the non-response to treatment often involves the presence of comorbid conditions. Non-responsive patients are more likely to meet criteria for comorbid axis I or axis II disorders and the presence of a specific comorbid condition could be a distinguishing feature in OCD, with influence on the treatment adequacy and outcome. © 2011 Pallanti, Grassi, Sar-recchia, Cantisani and Pellegrini.","OCD and ADHD; OCD and anxiety disorders; OCD and mood disorders; OCD and neurological diseases; OCD and psychosis; OCD comorbidity; Schizo-OCD","Abramowitz, J.S., Foa, E.B., Worries and obsessions in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder with and without comorbid generalized anxiety disorder (1998) Behav.

Research with adults supports either a two-factor or three-factor structure depending on reporting source and breadth of symptoms assessed. However, research with adults is limited and there are few studies addressing cross-national invariance in adults. The purposes of this study were to (1) assess relative fit of two- versus three-factor solutions for self-report of childhood and recent ADHD symptoms in adults; and (2) further establish cross-national invariance of factors. Participants included 271 U.S. and 712 Japanese university students who completed a rating scale assessing the 18 DSM-IV-TR ADHD symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis using Mplus (Version 6) and the mean and variance-adjusted weighted least squares (WLSMV) procedure showed invariance of two- and three-factor models across U.S. and Japanese samples. The two- and three-factor models showed similar fit indices. Neither a two-factor or three-factor model was clearly superior. The two-factor model was favored, however, because it is more parsimonious and consistent with current theory, and because of high correlations between hyperactive and impulsive factors in the three-factor models. Invariance across nations is consistent with previous studies and supports ADHD as a universally valid syndrome rather than a cultural construct. These results add to the limited knowledge of assessment of ADHD symptoms in Japan. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","ADHD; Attention; CFA; Cross-cultural; Factor analysis","(1968) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-II), , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association; (1980) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-III), , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association; (1987) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-III-R), , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association; (1994) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV), , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association; (1994) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV-TR), , American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association; http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx%3Frid=383, American Psychiatric Association (n.d.).

Based on a representative national sample of 4,046 children aged 2-17 from the 2008 National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence, the present study examines the associations between several different types of disability and past-year exposure to multiple forms of child victimization. Results suggest that attention-deficit disorder/attention-deficit with hyperactivity disorder elevates the risk for peer victimization and property crime, internalizing psychological disorders increase risk for both child maltreatment and sexual victimization, and developmental/learning disorders heighten risk only for property crime. In contrast, physical disability did not increase the risk for any type of victimization once confounding factors and co-occurring disabilities were controlled. It appears that disabilities associated with interpersonal and behavioral difficulties are most strongly associated with victimization risks. © The Author(s) 2011.","ADD/ADHD; child victimization; developmental disorders; physical disability; psychological disorders","(1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual on Mental Disorders: DSM-IV, , Diagnostic and statistical manual on mental disorders: DSM-IV (4th ed.).;, Washington, DC: Author; (2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (Rev. 4th ed.).;, Washington, DC: Author; Atrostic, B.K., Bates, N., Burt, G., Silberstein, A., Nonresponse in U.S. government household surveys: Consistent measures, recent trends, and new insights (2001) Journal of Official Statistics, 17, pp. 209-226; Babbie, E., (2007) The Practice of Social Research, , The practice of social research (11th ed.).Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.;, Belmont, CA: Wadsworth; Bauman, L.J., Silver, E.J., Stein, R.E.K., Cumulative social disadvantage and child health (2006) Pediatrics, 117, pp. 1321-1328; Berger, L.M., Income, family structure, and child maltreatment risk (2004) Child and Youth Services Review, 26, pp. 725-748; Biederman, J., Petty, C., Hirshfield-Becker, D.R., Henin, A., Faraone, S.V., Dang, D., Rosenbaum, J.F., A controlled longitudinal 5-year follow-up study of children at high and low risk for panic disorder and major depression (2006) Psychological Medicine, 36, pp. 1141-1152; Chance, T., Scannapieco, M., Ecological correlates of child maltreatment: Similarities and differences between child fatality and nonfatality cases (2002) Child & Adolescent Social Work Journal, 19, pp. 139-161; Cohen, S., Warren, R.D., The intersection of disability and child abuse in England and the United States (1990) Child Welfare, 69, pp. 253-262; Curtin, R., Presser, S., Singer, E., The effects of response rate changes on the index of consumer sentiment (2000) Public Opinion Quarterly, 64, pp. 413-428; Curtin, R., Presser, S., Singer, E., Changes in telephone survey nonresponse over the past quarter century (2005) Public Opinion Quarterly, 69, pp. 87-98; Evans, D.L., Foa, E.B., Gur, R.E., Hendin, H., O'Brien, C.P., Seligman, M.E.P., Walsh, B.T., (2005) Treating and Preventing Adolescent Mental Health Disorders; What We Know and What We Don't Know, , Treating and preventing adolescent mental health disorders; What we know and what we don't know (Eds.).Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.;, Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; Finkelhor, D., Hamby, S.L., Ormrod, R.K., Turner, H.A., The JVQ: Reliability, validity, and national norms (2005) Child Abuse & Neglect, 29 (4), pp. 383-412; Finkelhor, D., Ormrod, R.K., Turner, H.A., Hamby, S.L., Measuring poly-victimization using the JVQ (2005) Child Abuse & Neglect, 29 (11), pp. 1297-1312; Finkelhor, D., Ormrod, R.K., Turner, H.A., Hamby, S.L., The victimization of children and youth: A comprehensive, national survey (2005) Child Maltreatment, 10 (1), pp. 5-25; Finkelhor, D., Ormrod, R.K., Turner, H.A., Poly-victimization and trauma in a national longitudinal cohort (2007) Development and Psychopathology, 19 (1), pp. 149-166; Finkelhor, D., (2008) Childhood Victimization: Violence, Crime, and Abuse in the Lives of Young People, , New York: Oxford University Press; Finkelhor, D., Turner, H.A., Ormrod, R., Hamby, S.L., Violence, abuse, and crime exposure in a national sample of children and youth (2009) Pediatrics, 124 (5), pp. 1-13; Finnegan, R.A., Hodges, E.V.E., Perry, D.G., Victimization by peers: Associations with children's report s of mother-child interaction (1998) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 75 (4), pp. 1076-1086; Foshee, V.A., Benefield, T.S., Ennett, S.T., Bauman, K.E., Suchindran, C., Longitudinal predictors of serious physical and sexual dating violence victimization during adolescence (2004) Preventive Medicine, 39, pp. 1007-1016; Govindshenoy, M., Spencer, N., (2006) Journal Compelation.

DSM-IV diagnoses of all inpatients and outpatients at a large university-based hospital and its associated psychiatric clinics were systematically captured between 2000 and 2010: SUD, anxiety (AD), mood (MD), conduct (CD), attention deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD), personality (PD), adjustment, eating, impulse-control, psychotic, learning, mental retardation, and relational disorders. The prevalence of SUD in the 2-12-year age group (n=6210) was 1.6% and increased to 25% in the 13-17-year age group (n=5247). Cannabis diagnosis was the most prevalent SUD, accounting for more than 80% of all SUD cases. Among patients with a SUD (n=1423), children aged 2-12 years (95%) and females (75-100%) showed high rates of comorbidities; blacks were more likely than whites to be diagnosed with CD, impulse-control, and psychotic diagnoses, while whites had elevated odds of having AD, ADHD, MD, PD, relational, and eating diagnoses. Patients with a SUD used more inpatient treatment than patients without a SUD (43% vs. 21%); children, females, and blacks had elevated odds of inpatient psychiatric treatment. Collectively, results add clinical evidence on treatment needs and diagnostic patterns for understudied diagnoses. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder; Comorbidity; Comparative effectiveness research;

Material and Methods: Seventy-one volunteers from 4 popular heavy metal bars were included to the study. The Beck Depression Inventory, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), the Adult Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD/ADHD) Scale and the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) were administered to the participants. Results: One fourth of the participants (25.4%) were under high risk for a depressive episode (BDI>17), 22 (32.3%) reported significant social anxiety (LSAS>30), and 41 (57.7%) showed moderate ADHD symptoms (Adult ADD/ADHD scale: 20-59). According to BDI score participants who were under the risk for depression showed higher scores in Adult ADD/ADHD scale scores than that of participants who were not under a risk for depression (p=0.001 for attention deficit; p=0.003 for hyperactivity; p=0.002 for impulsivity; p=0.001 for total score). In the study group, ADD/ADHD scale attention deficit score was positively correlated with the total fear, total avoidence and the total scores of LSAS (r=.359 p<0.01; r=.332 p<0.01; r=.358 p<0.01, respectively). Conclusion: Heavy metal bar patrons appear to be a particular social group with an increased risk of psychopathology. © Trakya University Faculty of Medicine.","ADHD; Bar; Heavy metal; Music preference; Social anxiety","Le'Vine, M., (2008) Heavy Metal Islam, , New York: Three Rivers Press; Baker, F., Bor, W., Can music preference indicate mental health status in young people?

Attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are cases in point. This paper uses a social constructionist and framing approach to investigate the portrayal of risks associated with ADD/ADHD in popular magazines directed towards mass audiences in English speaking North America from 1988-2008. Aqualitative content analysis examines how the magazine articles answer the following questions about ADD and ADHD portrayal: (1) what is it?; (2) what is said to cause it?; and (3) what can be done about it? The findings suggest that ADD and ADHD are portrayed in polarising and contradictory ways in this popular medium. Magazine stories demonstrate deep ambivalence about whether or not ADD/ADHD even exist. They question whether or not the associated behaviours constitute medical problems. Despite this, described research on the causes of ADD/ADHD is almost always authoritatively described as either genetic or biological. Treatment by medications is often portrayed as profoundly problematic. This contentious and confusing portrayal exacerbates uncertainty and underscores the perception of risk. It reflects the competing interests operating in the social environment of ADD/ADHD including an ongoing but inconsistent tendency to medicalise this as other childhood mental/developmental/behavioural disorders. © 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","attention deficit disorder (ADD); attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); magazines; media portrayal; risk representation","Abada, T., Hou, F., Ram, B., The effects of harassment and victimization on self-rated health and mental health among Canadian adolescents (2008) Social Science & Medicine, 67 (4), pp. 557-567; Allen, R., Nairn, R.G., Media depictions of mental illness: An analysis of the use of dangerousness (1997) Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 13, pp. 375-381; Allan, S., Hidden in plain sight - journalism's critical issues (2005) Journalism: Critical issues, pp. 1-18. , In: Allan S., editors New York: Open University Press; Allan, S., Anderson, A., Peterson, A., Framing risk: Nanotechnologies in the news (2010) Journal of Risk Research, 13 (1), pp. 29-44; Altheide, D.L., Children and the discourse of fear (2002) Symbolic Interaction, 25, pp. 229-250; Beck, U., (1992) Risk society: Towards a new modernity, , London: Sage; Beck, U., (1994) Ecological politics in an age of risk, , London: Polity Press; Beveridge, A., Images of madness in the films of Walt Disney (1996) Psychiatric Bulletin, 20, pp. 618-620; Boero, N., All the news that's fat to print: The American 'obesity epidemic' and the media (2007) Qualitative Sociology, 30, pp. 41-60; Borinstein, A.B., Public attitudes towards persons with mental illness (1992) Health Affairs, 11 (3), pp. 186-196; Bussing, R.N., Schoenberg, E., Perwein, A.R., Knowledge and information about ADHD: Evidence of cultural difference among African American and white parents (1998) Social Science & Medicine, 46 (7), pp. 919-928; (2010) Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), , http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, online Available from; Clarke, J.N., Prostate cancer's hegemonic masculinity, in select print mass media depictions (1974-1995) (1999) Health Communication, 11 (1), pp. 59-74; Clarke, J.N., Breast cancer in mass circulating magazines in the USA and Canada (1974-1995) (1999) Women and Health, 28, pp. 113-130; Clarke, J.N., Gawley, A., The triumph of pharmaceuticals: The portrayal of depression from 1980-2005 (2009) Administration and Policy in Mental Health and Mental Health Research, 36 (2), pp. 91-101; Clarke, J.N., Robinson, J., Testicular cancer: Medicine and machismo in the media (1980-1994) (1999) Health, 3 (3), pp. 263-282; Cordell, A., Public health and children (2004) Children & Society, 18, pp. 243-246; Conrad, P., The shifting engines of medicalization (2005) Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 46, pp. 3-14; Cowley, G., Ramo, J.C., The not young and restless (1993) Newsweek, 26 July, pp. 48-49; Cutilli, C.C., Seeking health information: What sources do your patients use?

Methods: Post hoc analysis of a 4-week, open-label, dose-optimization phase in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) in adults with ADHD. The BADDS for Adults, a validated, normed, self-report measure of EF in ADHD, provides a qualitative measure to rate treatment progress. The ADHD-RS-IV assesses current symptom status based on DSM-IV criteria. Postbaseline ADHD-RS-IV scores were categorized according to four cutoff criteria of symptom remission: (1) ADHD-RS-IV total score a≤18; (2) ADHD-RS-IV total score a≤10; (3) no ADHD-RS-IV item scored &gt;1; and (4) ADHD-RS-IV total score a≤18 and a≤2 items per subscale with a score of 2. Sensitivity and specificity of criteria for identifying participants with optimal BADDS scores were assessed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Safety evaluation included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Results: At endpoint, 85/127 participants had optimal BADDS scores. Linear ANOVA indicated limited overlap between BADDS and ADHD-RS-IV scores (r 2=0.20; P&lt;0.0001). Specificity was similar for criteria 14 (0.46, 0.39, 0.39, and 0.42), as were ROC (0.699, 0.776, 0.732, and 0.668). Sensitivity was high for criteria 2 and 3 (0.96, 0.92), lower for criteria 1 and 4 (0.72, 0.75). TEAEs were consistent with those of stimulants. Conclusion: Criteria 2 and 3 had satisfactorily high sensitivity, but no criteria had adequate specificity. AUC comparison indicated that criteria 2 and 3 ADHD-RS-IV thresholds may be more accurate assessments of EF normalization as measured by the BADDS. The open-label design, small sample size, and selection criteria limit the applicability of these results to a larger treatment population. © 2011 Informa UK Ltd.","ADHD; BADDS; Executive function; Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate; Receiver operating characteristics; ROC","Attention-deficit and disruptive behavior disorders (2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSMIV-TR, pp. 85-93. , American Psychiatric Association 4th Edn, Text Revision.

Methods: Data were collected at a US clinic specializing in the treatment of adult ADHD. Patients completed the ASRS (six-item ADHD symptom screening version) and the AAQoL (a 29-item condition-specific HRQL measure) at two visits, two weeks apart. At the second visit, patients also completed a measure of symptom stability so that test-retest reliability could be examined in the stable population. Test-retest reliability was examined through intraclass correlations (ICC) and t-tests comparing scores from the two visits. Results: A total of 74 participants were enrolled (62.2% male; mean age = 38.6 years), and 43 of these participants attended both visits and were stable between visits (65.1% male; mean age = 39.3 years). The ICC assessing the association between Visit 1 and Visit 2 ASRS scores was 0.86, and the ICCs for the AAQoL subscales were 0.88 (Life Productivity), 0.75 (Psychological Health), 0.74 (Life Outlook), 0.78 (Relationships), and 0.86 (total score). The t-tests found no statistically significant differences between Visit 1 and Visit 2 scores for the ASRS or AAQoL. Conclusions: The ASRS and AAQoL demonstrated good test-retest reliability. Findings add to previous results suggesting that these instruments are useful outcome measures for treatments of ADHD in adults. © 2011 SAGE Publications.","AAQoL; ADHD; health-related quality of life; test-retest reliability","Adler, L.A., Spencer, T., Faraone, S.V., Kessler, R.C., Howes, M.J., Biederman, J., Secnik, K., Validity of pilot Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) to rate adult ADHD symptoms (2006) Annals of Clinical Psychiatry, 18, pp. 145-148; (2000) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, (4th ed.).

Without the efficient operation of these inhibitory mechanisms behaviour can become maladaptive, as seen in a large range of disorders where subjects exhibit impulsive responding, such as ADHD, mania, chronic substance abuse and schizophrenia. Animal models are making an increasing contribution to our understanding of the psychology and underlying neurobiology of behavioural inhibition and impulsivity. Here, in this short article we summarise work conducted with rat models, and also discuss recent progress in exploiting the potential of genetically engineered mice. The data so far emphasise the relatively high translational relevance of animal models in this area of behavioural neuroscience. The findings add weight to the existence of dissociable components of impulsive behaviour, they inform the human literature, and may be of significant use in the development of drug therapies to treat the many disorders where failures in behavioural inhibition are prominent. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Although there is a considerable body of research regarding the appropriate treatment of ADHD symptoms among typically developing children, the research among children with ASD is more limited. The evidence to date suggests that medication response rates among children with ASD are considerably lower than among typically developing children and that children with ASD tend to be at greater risk for experiencing side effects. The purpose of the present paper is to review the available research on the treatment of ADHD symptoms in children with ASD.

The current study found that older adolescents and adults with both disorders also had more difficulties on processing speed and working memory measures than individuals who only had ADHD. There were no differences among non-timed EF scores. These results add support to the premise that common underlying features may be contributing to the high co-morbidity between these disorders and associated cognitive weaknesses. © The Author 2011.

This increased activity has coincided with a recognition that pragmatic measures of outcome such as those that tap into impairment and health related quality of life (HRQOL) have the potential to add considerably to the traditional symptom based measures of outcome. There are however considerable methodological issues associated with these types of measure, and these are made more complex when they are applied in mental health and paediatric settings. There is a clear need for the continued development of valid and reliable measures of HRQOL and impairment that are fit for purpose for use in clinical trials. Other more specific issues that need to be considered, and which all require further investigation include those relating to; age, self versus proxy ratings, contextual issues, generic versus disorder specific measures and definitions of clinically meaningful change. Most of the child and adolescent mental health trials that have included pragmatic measures have been conducted in ADHD samples, have been industry sponsored, use only parent ratings and focus on one drug (atomoxetine). Taken together they do however suggest that pharmacological treatments can impact positively on impairment and HRQOL, although with smaller effect sizes than is seen for symptom reduction. Further studies, across a wider range of disorders and treatments with multiple measures and multiple raters, are to be encouraged. In addition to reporting the basic outcomes from these studies researchers should use these data to improve the measurement models and refine both the measures and the trial designs. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","ADHD; Adolescent; Child; Clinical trials; Depression; Impairment; Quality of life","Acquaviva, E., Legleye, S., Auleley, G.R., Deligne, J., Carel, D., Falissard, B.B., Psychotropic medication in the French child and adolescent population: prevalence estimation from health insurance data and national self-report survey data (2009) BMC Psychiatry, 9, p. 72; Adler, L.A., Spencer, T., Brown, T.E., Holdnack, J., Saylor, K., Schuh, K., Trzepacz, P.T., Kelsey, D., Once-daily atomoxetine for adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a 6-month, double-blind trial (2009) J.

N=96 children and adolescents participated in the study, including n=21 subjects with TD, n=23 subjects with ADHD, n=25 subjects with TD+ADHD, and n=27 controls. Attentional performance was tested based on four computerized attention tasks (sustained attention, divided attention, go/nogo and set shifting). The effect of TD as well as ADHD on attentional performance was tested using a 2×2 factorial approach. A diagnosis of TD had no negative impact on attentional functions but was associated with improved performance in the set shifting task. By contrast, regardless of a diagnosis of TD, subjects with ADHD were found to perform worse in the sustained attention, divided attention and go/nogo task. No interaction effect between the factors TD and ADHD was revealed for any of the attention measures. Our results add to findings from other areas of research, showing that in subjects with TD and ADHD, ADHD psychopathology is often the main source of impairment, whereas a diagnosis of TD has little or no impact on neuropsychological performance in most cases and even seems to be associated with adaptive mechanisms. © 2011 The Author(s).","Attention; Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; Comorbidity; Tic disorder","Achenbach, T.M., (1993) Empirically Based Taxonomy: How to Use Syndromes and Profile Types Derived from the CBCL from 4 to 18, TRF, and WSR, , University of Vermont, Department of Psychiatry Burlington; Albin, R.L., Mink, J.W., Recent advances in Tourette syndrome research (2006) Trends in Neurosciences, 29, pp. 175-182. , 16430974 10.1016/j.tins.2006.01.001; Banaschewski, T., Neale, B.M., Rothenberger, A., Roessner, V., Comorbidity of tic disorders & ADHD: Conceptual and methodological considerations (2007) European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 16 (SUPPL. 1), pp. I/5-I/14. , DOI 10.1007/s00787-007-1002-8; Barkley, R.A., Associated cognitive, developmental, and health problems (2006) Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Handbook for Diagnosis and Treatment, pp. 184-218. , R.A.

The main aim of the current study was to evaluate a newly developed cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) based group programme, the Reasoning and Rehabilitation for ADHD Youths and Adults (R&R2ADHD), using a randomized controlled trial.Methods: 54 adults with ADHD already receiving psychopharmacological treatment were randomly allocated to an experimental (CBT/MED) treatment condition (n = 27) and a 'treatment as usual' (TAU/MED) control condition (n = 27) that did not receive the CBT intervention. The outcome measures were obtained before treatment (baseline), after treatment and at three month follow-up and included ADHD symptoms and impairments rated by independent assessors, self-reported current ADHD symptoms, and comorbid problems.Results: The findings suggested medium to large treatment effects for ADHD symptoms, which increased further at three month follow-up. Additionally, comorbid problems also improved at follow-up with large effect sizes.Conclusions: The findings give support for the effectiveness of R&R2ADHD in reducing ADHD symptoms and comorbid problems, an improving functions associated with impairment. The implications are that the benefits of R&R2ADHD are multifaceted and that combined psychopharmacological and CBT based treatments may add to and improve pharmacological interventions.Trial registration: ACTRN12611000533998 (http://www.ANZCTR.org.au/ACTRN12611000533998.aspx). © 2011 Emilsson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Barkley, R.A., Murphy, K.R., Fischer, M., (2008) ADHD in adults: What the science says, , New York: The Guilford Press; Kessler, R.C., Adler, L., Barkley, R., Biederman, J., Conners, C.K., Demler, O., Faraone, S.V., Zaslavsky, A.M., The prevalence and correlates of adult ADHD in the United States: Results from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (2006) American Journal of Psychiatry, 163 (SUPPL 4), pp. 716-723. , 2859678, 16585449; Young, S., Gudjonsson, G.H., Wells, J., Asherson, P., Theobald, D., Oliver, B., Scott, C., Mooney, A., Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and critical incidents in a Scottish prison population (2009) Personality and Individual Difference, 46, pp. 265-269; Young, S., Wells, J., Gudjonsson, G.H., Predictors of offending among prisoners.

There appears to be an increasing rate of stimulant drug abuse, specifically methylphenidate (MPH) which is the most common treatment for ADHD, among individuals who do not meet the criteria for ADHD and particularly for cognitive enhancement among university students. However, the long term effects of exposure to MPH are unknown. Thus, in light of a developmental approach in humans, we aimed to test the effects of adolescence exposure to enriched environment (EE) followed by MPH administration during early adulthood, on reactions to stress in adulthood. Specifically, at approximate adolescence [post natal days (PND) 30-60] rats were reared in EE and were treated with MPH during early adulthood (PND 60-90). Adult (PND 90-92) rats were exposed to mild stress and starting at PND 110, the behavioral and endocrine effects of the combined drug and environmental conditions were assessed. Following adolescence EE, long term exposure to MPH led to decreased locomotor activity and increased sucrose preference. EE had a beneficial effect on PPI (attentive abilities), which was impaired by long term exposure to MPH. Finally, the interaction between EE and, exposure to MPH led to long-term elevated corticosterone and testosterone levels. In view of the marked increase in MPH consumption over the past decade, vigilance is crucial in order to prevent potential drug abuse and its long term detrimental consequences. © 2011 Avital et al.",,"Aron, A.R., Dowson, J.H., Sahakian, B.J., Robbins, T.W., Methylphenidate improves response inhibition in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (2003) Biol Psychiatry, 54, pp. 1465-1468; Hawk Jr., L.W., Yartz, A.R., Pelham Jr., W.E., Lock, T.M., The effects of methylphenidate on prepulse inhibition during attended and ignored prestimuli among boys with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (2003) Psychopharmacology (Berl), 165, pp. 118-127; Abikoff, H., Hechtman, L., Klein, R.G., Weiss, G., Fleiss, K., Symptomatic improvement in children with ADHD treated with long-term methylphenidate and multimodal psychosocial treatment (2004) J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 43, pp. 802-811; Mehta, M.A., Goodyer, I.M., Sahakian, B.J., Methylphenidate improves working memory and set-shifting in AD/HD: relationships to baseline memory capacity (2004) J Child Psychol Psychiatry, 45, pp. 293-305; Volkow, N.D., Wang, G.J., Fowler, J.S., Gatley, S.J., Logan, J., Dopamine transporter occupancies in the human brain induced by therapeutic doses of oral methylphenidate (1998) Am J Psychiatry, 155, pp. 1325-1331; Anderson, V.R., Scott, L.J., Methylphenidate transdermal system: In attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children (2006) Drugs, 66, pp. 1117-1126; Hannestad, J., Gallezot, J.D., Planeta-Wilson, B., Lin, S.F., Williams, W.A., Clinically relevant doses of methylphenidate significantly occupy norepinephrine transporters in humans in vivo (2010) Biol Psychiatry, 68, pp. 854-860; Teicher, M.H., Ito, Y., Glod, C.A., Barber, N.I., Objective measurement of hyperactivity and attentional problems in ADHD (1996) J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 35, pp. 334-342; Nass, R.D., Evaluation and assessment issues in the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (2005) Semin Pediatr Neurol, 12, pp. 200-216; Rey, J.M., Sawyer, M.G., Are psychostimulant drugs being used appropriately to treat child and adolescent disorders?

Methods: The study was composed of two parts. We aimed to determine the prevalence in the first part. All patients who had presented to the Istanbul University Department of Psychiatry outpatient clinic during the period February-May 2005 had filled in the Adult ADD/ADHD DSM IV-Based Diagnostic Screening and Rating Scale. The patients scored above the cutoff value were evaluated with the Semi-structured Interview Form for ADHD and were diagnosed as having ADHD according to the DSM criteria by psychiatrist. The patients diagnosed with ADHD were reevaluated by consultant lecturer. In the second part of the study, comorbid diagnoses were investigated using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) in the ADHD patients identified in the first part and the patients diagnosed with ADHD in the ADHD outpatient clinic, Department of Psychiatry, Istanbul Medical Faculty. Results: The patients diagnosed as having ADHD were mostly young men. Alcohol and substance abuse were very common problems inADHD patients. The prevalence of ADHD in adult psychiatric outpatient clinic was found to be at least 1.6%. Conclusion: ADHD is represented less than the expected rate in the general population. ADHD symptoms should be inquired in adult patients who present to psychiatry departments with alcohol or drug problems. © Archives of Neuropsychiatry, published by Galenos Publishing.","Adult; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Comorbidity; Prevalence","(1994) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, (4th ed.).

Children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) fail to show RT slowing and demonstrate increased intra-subject variability (ISV) on post-error trials. The neural correlates of these behavioral deficits remain unclear. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) are key regions implicated in error processing and subsequent behavioral adjustment. We hypothesized that children with ADHD, compared to typically developing (TD) controls, would exhibit reduced PFC activation during post-error (versus post-correct inhibition) trials and reduced dACC activation during error (versus correct inhibition) trials. Methods: Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and a Go/No-Go task, we analyzed the neural correlates of error processing in 13 children with ADHD and 17 TD children. Results: Behaviorally, children with ADHD showed similar RT slowing but increased ISV compared to controls. The post-error contrast revealed a relative increase in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal in the middle/inferior temporal cortex (TempC), the ACC/supplementary motor area (SMA) and the somatosensory/auditory cortex (AudC) in children with ADHD compared to controls. Importantly, in the ADHD group, increased post-error temporal cortex activity was associated with lower ISV. During error (versus correct inhibition) trials, no between-group differences were detected. However, in children with ADHD lower ISV was associated with decreased insula and increased precentral gyrus activity. Conclusions: In children with ADHD, post-error neural activity suggests, first, a shift of attention towards task-irrelevant stimuli (AudC), and second, a recruitment of compensatory regions that resolve stimulus conflict (TempC) and improve response selection/execution (ACC/SMA). ADHD children with higher temporal cortex activation showed lower ISV, suggesting that functional abnormalities in the compensatory temporal regions contribute to increased variability. Moreover, increased ISV may be related to an over-sensitivity to negative outcomes during error trials in ADHD (insula correlation).

Participants: The sample consisted of 61 patients (average age 35.11 ± 9.33 years) from our ADHD consultation who were consecutively included in our study over a period of 12 months. Measurements: We diagnosed ADHD according to DSM-IV-R and by assessing the WURS-k, CAARS and BROWN ADD scales. For diagnosing addiction we conducted the EuropASI, the IDCL, the QOD and the FTNA. For differential diagnosis we assessed the SCL-K. Results: About half of our study population of ADHD patients were diagnosed with a dependence disorder (50.8%, n = 31). Twenty one dot three percent (n = 13) were suffering from an alcohol dependence, 13.1% (n = 8) from a substance use disorder (SUD) and 18% (n = 11) from a combination of both addictions. The drug consumed most commonly by ADHD patients was cannabis. Alcohol and substance abuse commenced significantly earlier in patients with ADHD than in patients with addiction disorders without comorbid ADHD. Conclusions: Our data show that the risk of developing a dependence disorder is elevated in ADHD patients. Clinicians should bear in mind that the characteristics of a dependence in ADHD patients are clinically more pronounced and that an addiction in ADHD patients starts earlier than usually expected.","Addiction; ADHD; Adults; Comorbidity; Epidemiology","Huss, M., (2004) Vorbereitung Der Erhebung Und Auswertung Zur Prävalenz Des Aufmerksamkeit-Defizit-Hyperaktivitäts- Syndroms (ADHS) In Deutschland Im Rahmen Des Kinder- Und Jungend-Surveys Des Robert-Koch-Instituts, , Abschlussbericht an das Bundesministerium für Gesundheit und soziale Sicherung (BMGS).

This increased activity has coincided with a recognition that pragmatic measures of outcome such as those that tap into impairment and health related quality of life (HRQOL) have the potential to add considerably to the traditional symptom based measures of outcome. There are however considerable methodological issues associated with these types of measure, and these are made more complex when they are applied in mental health and paediatric settings. There is a clear need for the continued development of valid and reliable measures of HRQOL and impairment that are fit for purpose for use in clinical trials. Other more specific issues that need to be considered, and which all require further investigation include those relating to; age, self versus proxy ratings, contextual issues, generic versus disorder specific measures and definitions of clinically meaningful change. Most of the child and adolescent mental health trials that have included pragmatic measures have been conducted in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) samples, have been industry sponsored, use only parent ratings and focus on one drug (atomoxetine). Taken together they do however suggest that pharmacological treatments can impact positively on impairment and HRQOL, although with smaller effect sizes than is seen for symptom reduction. Further studies, across a wider range of disorders and treatments with multiple measures and multiple raters, are to be encouraged. In addition to reporting the basic outcomes from these studies researchers should use these data to improve the measurement models and refine both the measures and the trial designs. © 2011 Elsevier España, S.L.

Due to concerns that MPH might induce cytogenetic alterations in children, treatment with this drug has been a controversial issue. In the present study, we assessed the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes (MNEs), micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCEs), and polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) in peripheral blood samples from mice treated with three different doses of MPH (30, 60, or 125 mg/kg). We found no evidence of increased MNEs or MNPCEs, nor did PCEs decline. These results add to the accumulating evidence that MPH does not induce genotoxic or cytotoxic damage. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","Genotoxicity; micronuclei; mouse; peripheral blood erythrocytes; Ritalin","Practice parameter for the use of stimulant medications in the treatment of children, adolescents, and adults (2002) J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 41, pp. 26S-48S. , American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry; Andreazza, A.C., Frey, B.N., Valvassori, S.S., Zanotto, C., Gomes, K.M., Comim, C.M., Cassini, C., Goncalves, C.A., DNA damage in rats after treatment with methylphenidate (2007) Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry, 31 (6), pp. 1282-1288. , DOI 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2007.05.012, PII S0278584607001856; Biederman, J., Faraone, S.V., Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (2005) Lancet, 366 (9481), pp. 237-248. , DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66915-2, PII S0140673605669152; Bonassi, S., Znaor, A., Norppa, H., Hagmar, L., Chromosomal aberrations and risk of cancer in humans: An epidemiologic perspective (2004) Cytogenetic and Genome Research, 104 (1-4), pp. 376-382. , DOI 10.1159/000077519; Bonassi, S., Znaor, A., Ceppi, M., Lando, C., Chang, W.P., Holland, N., Kirsch-Volders, M., Fenech, M., An increased micronucleus frequency in peripheral blood lymphocytes predicts the risk of cancer in humans (2007) Carcinogenesis, 28 (3), pp. 625-631. , DOI 10.1093/carcin/bgl177; Cammerer, Z., Elhajouji, A., Kirsch-Volders, M., Suter, W., Comparison of the peripheral blood micronucleus test using flow cytometry in rat and mouse exposed to aneugens after single-dose applications (2007) Mutagenesis, 22 (2), pp. 129-134. , DOI 10.1093/mutage/gel066; Devilbiss, D.M., Berridge, C.W., Cognition-enhancing doses of methylphenidate preferentially increase prefrontal cortex neuronal responsiveness (2008) Biol Psychiatry, 64, pp. 626-635; El-Zein, R.A., Abdel-Rahman, S.Z., Hay, M.J., Lopez, M.S., Bondy, M.L., Morris, D.L., Legator, M.S., Cytogenetic effects in children treated with methylphenidate (2005) Cancer Letters, 230 (2), pp. 284-291. , DOI 10.1016/j.canlet.2005.01.003, PII S0304383505000376; Faraone, S.V., Sergeant, J., Gillberg, C., Biederman, J., The worldwide prevalence of ADHD: Is it an American condition?

The participants for the sight word and phonics portion of this study were two seven-year-old boys in the second grade. Both participants were diagnosed with a learning disability. The third participant was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder by his pediatrician and with a learning disability and traumatic brain injury by his school's multi-disciplinary team. The dependent measures were corrects and errors when reading from a first grade level sight word list. Math facts were selected based on a 100 add fact test for the third participant. The study demonstrated that racetracks paired with the flashcard intervention improved the students' number of corrects for each subject-matter area (phonics, sight words, and math facts).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, children and adolescents with hyperactive- or combined-subtype ADHD who had an inadequate response to their stable stimulant regimen were randomized to receive CLON-XR or placebo in combination with their baseline stimulant medication. Predefined efficacy measures evaluated change from baseline to week 5. Safety was assessed by spontaneously reported adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram recordings, and clinical laboratory values. Improvement from baseline for all efficacy measures was evaluated using analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Of 198 patients randomized, 102 received CLON-XR plus stimulant and 96 received placebo plus stimulant. At week 5, greater improvement from baseline in ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total score (95% confidence interval: -7.83 to -1.13; P = .009), ADHD-RS-IV hyperactivity and inattention subscale scores (P = .014 and P = .017, respectively), Conners' Parent Rating Scale scores (P < .062), Clinical Global Impression of Severity (P = .021), Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (P = .006), and Parent Global Assessment (P = .001) was observed in the CLON-XR plus stimulant group versus the placebo plus stimulant group. Adverse events and changes in vital signs in the CLON-XR group were generally mild. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that CLON-XR in combination with stimulants is useful in reducing ADHD in children and adolescents with partial response to stimulants.

However, the specificity of these deficits has not been adequately tested. In the current study, verbal learning and memory performance of children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure was compared to children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a disorder commonly seen in alcohol-exposed children. Methods: Performance on the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C) was examined in 3 groups of children (N=22/group): (i) heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and ADHD (ALC), (ii) nonexposed with ADHD (ADHD), and (iii) nonexposed typically developing (CON). Groups were matched on age, sex, race, ethnicity, handedness, and socioeconomic status (SES). Results: Group differences were noted on learning trials (CON>ADHD>ALC). On the delayed recall trial, CON children performed better than both clinical groups, who did not differ from each other. Children in the ALC group demonstrated poorer recognition than children in the CON and ADHD groups, who did not differ from each other. Marginally significant group differences were noted on retention of previously learned material. Post hoc analyses indicated that ADHD children showed worse retention relative to the CON group, whereas retention in the ALC children remained intact. Conclusions: These data suggest that children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and nonexposed children with ADHD show differential patterns of deficit on the CVLT-C. Performance of alcohol-exposed children reflects inefficient encoding of verbal material, whereas performance of the ADHD group may be better characterized by a deficit in retrieval of learned material. Differences noted between clinical groups add to a growing neurobehavioral profile of FASD that may aid in differential diagnosis. © 2011 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.","CVLT-c; Differential diagnosis; Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders; Fetal alcohol syndrome; Verbal learning and memory","Adams, K.M., Brown, G.G., Grant, I., Analysis of covariance as a remedy for demographic mismatch of research subject groups: some sobering simulations (1985) J Clin Exp Neuropsychol, 7, pp. 445-462; Baldo, J.V., Delis, D.C., Kramer, J.H., Shimamura, A.P., Memory performance on the California Verbal Learning Test-II: findings from patients with focal frontal lesions (2002) J Int Neuropsychol Soc, 8, pp. 539-546; Barkley, R.A., Behavioral inhibition, sustained attention, and executive functions: constructing a unifying theory of ADHD (1997) Psychol Bull, 121, pp. 65-94; Barnett, R., Maruff, P., Vance, A., An investigation of visuospatial memory impairment in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), combined type (2005) Psychol Med, 35, pp. 1433-1443; Bertrand, J., Floyd, R.L., Weber, M.K., Guidelines for identifying and referring persons with fetal alcohol syndrome (2005) MMWR Recomm Rep, 54, pp. 1-14; Bush, G., Valera, E.M., Seidman, L.J., Functional neuroimaging of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a review and suggested future directions (2005) Biol Psychiatry, 57, pp. 1273-1284; Cahn, D.A., Marcotte, A.C., Rates of forgetting in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (1995) Child Neuropsychol, 1, pp. 158-163; Carmichael Olson, H., Feldman, J.J., Streissguth, A.P., Sampson, P.D., Bookstein, F.L., Neuropsychological deficits in adolescents with fetal alcohol syndrome: clinical findings (1998) Alcohol Clin Exp Res, 22, pp. 1998-2012; Cohen, P., O'Connor, P., Lewis, S., Velez, C.N., Malachowski, B., Comparison of DISC and K-SADS-P interviews of an epidemiological sample of children (1987) J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 26, pp. 662-667; Coles, C.D., Brown, R.T., Smith, I.E., Platzman, K.A., Erickson, S., Falek, A., Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure at school age.

Some authors have proved how the Deficit and Attention/Hyperactivity Disorder may predispose to the development of other psychopathological attitude in adulthood. A recent study has underlined a common comorbidity between ADHD in childhood and Bipolar Disorder. The aim of the present was to verify the existence of an ADHD diagnosis in patients with depression (Unipolar and Bipolar) and to verify if such syndrome overstays in the present psychopathological picture. Moreover there has been even the intention to investigate on a difference in ADHD symptomatology in patients with Bipolar and Unipolar Depression. Materials and Methods: The study has been conducted on a sample of 67 patients with depression diagnosis (35 patients with bipolar depression diagnosis, 32 patients with depression unipolar diagnosis) enrolled at the Bipolar Disorders Unit of the Clinical Psychiatry and Drug Dependence Institute of the Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli in Rome. The evaluation has been performed through the supply of the following psychometric tests: Neo Personality Inventory (Mole-pi-R), Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (Brown ADD-Scale), Adult ADHD Self-Report Staircases (ASRS-v1.1), Criteria of the Deficit and Attention/Hyperactivity Disorder for childhood according to the DSM-IV-Tr. Results: The achieved results point out that 42% of the sample has satisfied the ADHD Criterions during their childhood according to the DSM-IV-Tr and that symptomatology seems to remain in the present psychopathological picture. As to polarity of depression it has emerged that patients with Bipolar Depression diagnosis have satisfied with a greater frequency the ADHD criteria during their childhood than patients with Unipolar Depression. Conclusions: Our results seem to confirm the hypothesis that patients with bipolar depression diagnosis have more Deficit and Attention/Hyperactivity Disorders comorbidity diagnosis than others.","Bipolar depression; Deficit and attention/hyperactivity disorders; Unipolare depression","Disturbi da Deficit di Attenzione e da Comportamento Dirompente (2001), pp. 10-111. , American Psychiatric Association, American Psychiatric Association.

Yet, the question whether different SPD characterize children with different types of ADHD has not received enough attention in the literature. The current study characterized sensory processing difficulties (SPD) of children with different types of ADHD and explored the relationship between SPD and leisure activity preference.Participants were 58 boys aged 6-10 years: 29 boys with ADHD: 15 with hyperactive-impulsive type and 14 characterized as inattentive. The controls were 29 typical peers. SPD were evaluated by The Short Sensory Profile (SSP) completed by the parents. Participants answered the preference for activities of children (PAC).According the results, SPD were manifested among children with both ADHD types. Children with both ADHD types showed significantly lower preference to participate in leisure activities than the controls. Their lower preference correlated with SPD. The findings suggest that children with different ADHD types may share common SPD, which may negatively impact their activity preference. In this study it seemed that children with ADD were more vulnerable to these impacts. SPD and participation should be considered in evaluation and intervention programs for children with ADHD in order to focus on child's abilities, needs and preferences, and enhance intervention success, child's relationships with peers and child's well-being. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Activity preference; ADHD; Leisure activities; Outcome measure; Participation; Sensory processing","Ahn, R.R., Miller, L.J., Milberger, S., McIntosh, D., Prevalence of parent's perception of sensory processing disorders among kindergarten children (2004) American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 58, pp. 287-293; Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (2000) Text revision (DSM-IV-TR), , American Psychiatric Association, American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC; Ayres, A.J., (1979) Sensory integration and the child, , Western Psychological Services, Los Angeles; Barkley, R.A., (1990) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: A handbook for diagnosis and treatment, , Guilford Press, New York; Barkley, R.A., Fischer, M., Smallish, L., Fletcher, K., Young adult outcome of hyperactive children: Adaptive functioning in major life activities (2006) Journal of the American Academy of Child Adolescent Psychiatry, 45, pp. 192-202; Bar-Shalita, T., Vatine, J., Parush, S., Sensory modulation disorder: A risk factor for participation in daily life activities (2008) Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology, 50, pp. 932-937; Beyer, R., Motor proficiency of boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and boys with learning disabilities (1999) Adapted Physical Activity Quarterly, 16, pp. 403-414; Biederman, J., Mick, E., Faraone, S.V., Braaten, E., Doyle, A., Spencer, T., Wilens, T.E., Johnson, M.A., Influence of gender on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children referred to a psychiatric clinic (2002) American Journal of Psychiatry, 159, pp. 36-42; Bioulac, S., Arfi, L., Bouvard, M.P., Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and video games: A comparative study of hyperactive and control children (2008) European Psychiatry, 23, pp. 134-141; Bundy, A.C., Using sensory integration theory in schools: Sensory integration and consultation (2002) Sensory integration: Theory and practice, pp. 309-332. , F.A.

Method: The study included 58 women from a larger longitudinal study of ADHD. A total of 34 (M = 19.97 years old) met DSM criteria for ADHD in childhood, whereas the remaining 24 (M = 19.83 years old) did not. Self- and parent-reports of psychopathology, delinquency, interpersonal relationships, academic achievement, job performance, and substance use were collected. Results: The findings suggest that girls with ADHD experience difficulties in late adolescence and young adulthood, such as more conflict with their mothers, being involved in fewer romantic relationships, and experiencing more depressive symptoms than comparison women. However, differences did not emerge in all domains, such as job performance, substance use, and self-reported ADHD symptomatology. Conclusion: The findings of this study add to the literature on the negative late adolescent and young adult outcomes associated with childhood ADHD in women. (J. of Att.

We reexamined the content of IQ tests prior to looking at the validity of these instruments. In order to determine if these tests yield profiles for groups of individuals previously diagnosed, we summarized research provided by the respective test authors. Overall, we found that no distinctive IQ test profiles were found for the groups of individuals with LD. The test of basic psychological processes that did show a specific cognitive weakness (e.g., a score that was low relative to the other scales provided on the test that were also in the average range and low in relation to the norm) for those with a specific reading decoding disorder was the CAS. Similarly, the only test to show evidence of a specific cognitive weakness for individuals with ADHD was also the CAS. This information is useful when the discrepancy/ consistency approach is used. The findings presented in this chapter suggest that traditional IQ tests that use subtests built on the verbal, quantitative, and nonverbal formats do not appear to be sensitive to the cognitive disorders underlying a learning or attention disorder. In contrast, the cognitive processing tests described here have more carefully defined abilities that, in the case of the CAS, do appear to identify the cognitive processing weakness for those with specific RD and ADHD. Importantly, the cognitive processing weakness found for these two groups are consistent with an understanding of each disorder. For example, those with reading decoding difficulty have problems working with information that is arranged or has to be recalled in a specific sequence (Das et al., 1994). Those with ADHD have a specific problem related to self-regulation of thoughts and actions (Goldstein & Naglieri, 2006). Knowing the cognitive processing failure related to the academic failure not only provides important information for diagnosis/eligibility, but it also provides the opportunity for successful intervention design and/or selection (see Naglieri, 2008; Naglieri & Pickering, 2010). Since their introduction in the early 1900s, IQ tests have provided a valuable way to measure general ability. As the findings summarized in this chapter suggest, however, the tests have limited utility for diagnosis for persons with LD and ADHD. With the more recent development of new tests that measure basic psychological processes comes the hope of increased utility for diagnosis and treatment. Tests of basic psychological processes offer potential advantages by providing measures of theoretically defined constructs that appear to identify specific areas of cognitive deficits related to the academic failure. More research into the utility of these tests for diagnostic and intervention purposes is clearly warranted. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","CAS; Cognitive; Individuals with disabilities education act (IDEA); Planning, attention, simultaneous, and successive (PASS); Processing speed index (PSI); Specific learning disability (SLD); WAIS-IV","(2000) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, 4th ed., text rev., Washington, DC: Author; Anastasi, A., Urbina, S., (1997) Psychological testing, , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall; Barkley, R.A., (1997) ADHD and the nature of self-control, , New York, NY: Guilford Press; Binet, A., Simon, T., New methods for the diagnosis of the intellectual level of subnormals (1905) L'Année Psychologique, 11, pp. 191-244; Das, J.P., Naglieri, J.A., Kirby, J.R., Assessment of cognitive processes (1994) Boston, MA: Allyn & Bacon; Davis, F.B., Interpretation of differences among averages and individual test scores (1959) Journal of Educational Psychology, 50, pp. 162-170; (2006) Department of Education, 71, pp. 46540-46845. , Federal Register; Goldberg, E., (2002) The executive brain: Frontal lobes and the civilized mind, , New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Goldstein, S., Naglieri, J.A., The role of intellectual processes in the DSM-V diagnosis of ADHD (2006) Journal of Attention Disorders, 10, pp. 3-8; Goldstein, S., Naglieri, J.A., (2009) Autism Spectrum Rating Scale, , Toronto, Canada: Multi Health Systems; Hale, J.B., Kaufman, A.S., Naglieri, J.A., Kavale, K.A., Implementation of IDEA: Using RTI and Cognitive Assessment Methods (2006) Psychology in the Schools,, 43 (7), pp. 753-770; Jensen, A.R., (1998), Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA), Pub.
