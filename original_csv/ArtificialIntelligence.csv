In this paper, an integrated PRNET (PCA-Radial basis functional neural NET) model is proposed in different versions to select the relevant parameters for preparing composite preforms and to predict the deformation and strain hardening properties of Al-Fe composites. It reveals that the predictability of this model has been increased by 67.89% relatively from the conventional models. A new PR-filter is proposed by slightly modifying the conventional filters of RBFNN, which improves the power of PRNET even though raw data are highly non-linear, interrelated and noisy. Moreover, fixing the range of input parameters for classifying the properties of composite preforms can be automated by the Fuzzy logic. These types of models will avoid expensive experimentation and risky environment while preparing sintered composite preforms. Thus the manufacturing process of composites in P/M Lab will be simplified with minimum energy by the support of these soft-computing tools. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Motivated by this fact, this paper investigated the importance of collecting and using statistics on neighboring secondary users (SUs) in selecting channels in addition to the knowledge of PU channel usage. The paper assumed that PU traffic characteristics of the channels are included in the radio environment map in the form of probabilistic suffix trees, which is a sequence predictor based on Markov property. In the proposed method, an intelligent sequence hopping-based common control channel and a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)/collision avoidance (CA)-based medium access control (MAC) protocol were introduced. As shown in the paper, selecting channels using statistics of both the neighboring SUs and PUs reduced the number of packet collisions compared to a scheme which only uses PU statistics. Furthermore, the simulation results showed that the scheme proposed had better throughput performance with respect to both the random channel selection scheme and the scheme which only uses PU statistics while having less training complexity. © 2015, Devanarayana and Alfa; licensee Springer.","Artificial intelligence; Cognitive radio; Prediction methods; Predictive control","ET Docket No 03-222 Notice of proposed rule making and order (2003) December, p. 2003; Federal Communications Commission Spectrum Policy Task Force Report of the Spectrum Efficiency Working Group (2002)Tan, L., Le, L., Joint cooperative spectrum sensing and MAC protocol design for multi-channel cognitive radio networks (2014) EURASIP J.

The part of the brain cortex that processes language abilities is one of the earliest parts to be affected by the disease. Therefore, detection of Alzheimer’s disease using speech-based features is gaining increasing attention. Here, we investigated an extensive set of features based on speech prosody as well as linguistic features derived from transcriptions of Turkish conversations with subjects with and without Alzheimer’s disease. Unlike most standardized tests that focus on memory recall or structured conversations, spontaneous unstructured conversations are conducted with the subjects in informal settings. Age-, education-, and gender-controlled experiments are performed to eliminate the effects of those three variables. Experimental results show that the proposed features extracted from the speech signal can be used to discriminate between the control group and the patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Prosodic features performed significantly better than the linguistic features. Classification accuracy over 80% was obtained with three of the prosodic features, but experiments with feature fusion did not further improve the classification performance. © 2015, Khodabakhsh et al.","Alzheimer’s disease; Linguistic features; Machine learning; Prosodic features; Speech processing","http://www.alz.co.uk/research/world-report-2013, M Prince, M Guerchet, M Prina, World Alzheimer report 2013: Journey of caring: an analysis of long-term care for dementia.

However, learning of BNs structures from data has been shown to be an NP-hard problem. It has turned out to be one of the most exciting challenges in machine learning. In this context, the present work's major objective lies in setting up a further solution conceived to be a remedy for the intricate algorithmic complexity imposed during the learning of BN-structure with a massively-huge data backlog. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore restoration is a key issue to power systems. Reasonable backbone-network reconfiguration is necessary for re-establishing the network and restoring loads quickly. In order to speed up network reconfiguration under security constraints, a group decision support system (GDSS) is developed. A unified data platform based on data warehouse is constructed to resolve inconsistencies of data, information and models. A three-stage restoration strategy and a two-layer restoration path searching method are proposed to establish restoration schemes. Multiple attribute decision-making is implemented to evaluate alternatives and consider various attributes about restoration speed and system security comprehensively. Group decision-making provides an aggregated cardinal ranking of candidate restoration schemes. The GDSS uses expert rules for qualitative analysis and numerical computation programs for quantitative analysis, and it can resolve the semi-structured decision problem of network reconfiguration efficiently. Restoration plan of Shandong power grid is developed with the proposed method and it has been adopted by State Grid Shandong Electric Power Company. Performance results of Shandong power grid of China demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the method. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Data warehouse; Group decision support system; Intelligent system;

The cosine similarity matching approach is found to be robust for detecting false data injection attacks as well as other attacks in the smart grids.

Reference ranges for 32 chemical elements in 22 samples of sugarcane (13 organic and 9 non organic) were established and then two algorithms, Naive Bayes (NB) and Random Forest (RF), were evaluated to classify the samples. Accurate results (>90%) were obtained when using all variables (i.e., 32 elements). However, accuracy was improved (95.4% for NB) when only eight minerals (Rb, U, Al, Sr, Dy, Nb, Ta, Mo), chosen by a feature selection algorithm, were employed. Thus, the use of a fingerprint based on trace element levels associated with classification machine learning algorithms may be used as a simple alternative for authenticity evaluation of organic sugarcane samples. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Each stage of the approach was investigated extensively and with full comparison. To ensure credibility and robustness, a much larger sample set than previous studies was obtained. Furthermore, the prediction performance of three kinds of NIR spectra (equatorial surface spectra, distal end surface spectra and juice spectra) were evaluated and compared. By using an optimal machine learning approach, all three kinds of spectra yielded promising results for quality measurements. The obtained results were better than that in most previous studies. The equatorial surface spectra performed slightly but consistently better than the distal end spectra. The juice spectra performed best in predicting most internal quality parameters. But in predicting the vitamin C content, the juice spectra performed worse than the surface spectra, which indicated that the prediction with NIRS might result from indirect factors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Food quality; Machine learning; Near infrared spectroscopy","Antonucci, F., Pallottino, F., Paglia, G., Palma, A., D'Aquino, S., Menesatti, P., Non-destructive estimation of mandarin maturity status through portable VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (2011) Food Bioprocess Technol., 4 (5), pp. 809-813; Bobelyn, E., Serban, A.-S., Nicu, M., Lammertyn, J., Nicolai, B.M., Saeys, W., Postharvest quality of apple predicted by NIR-spectroscopy: Study of the effect of biological variability on spectra and model performance (2010) Postharvest Biol.

Curriculum learning is an established machine learning approach that achieves better models by applying a curriculum, i.e., a well-planned ordering of the training data, during the learning process. Our contribution is to demonstrate the importance of curriculum learning methods for adapting rnnlms and to provide key insights on how they should be applied. rnnlms model language in a continuous space and can theoretically exploit word-dependency information over arbitrarily long distances. These characteristics give rnnlms the ability to learn patterns robustly with relatively little training data, implying that they are well suited for adaptation. In this paper, we focus on two related challenges facing language models: within-domain adaptation and limited-data within-domain adaptation. We propose three types of curricula that start with general data, i.e., characterizing the domain as a whole, and move towards specific data, i.e., characterizing the sub-domain targeted for adaptation. Effectively, these curricula result in a model that can be considered to represent an implicit interpolation between general data and sub-domain-specific data. We carry out an extensive set of experiments that investigates how adapting rnnlms using curriculum learning can improve their performance. Our first set of experiments addresses the within-domain adaptation challenge, i.e., creating models that are adapted to specific sub-domains that are part of a larger, heterogeneous domain of speech data. Under this challenge, all training data is available to the system at the time when the language model is trained. First, we demonstrate that curriculum learning can be used to create effective sub-domain-adapted rnnlms. Second, we show that a combination of sub-domain-adapted rnnlms can be used if the sub-domain of the target data is unknown at test time. Third, we explore the potential of applying combinations of sub-domain-adapted rnnlms to data for which sub-domain information is unknown at training time and must be inferred. Our second set of experiments addresses limited-data within-domain adaptation, i.e., adapting an existing model trained on a large set of data using a smaller amount of data from the target sub-domain. Under this challenge, data from the target sub-domain is not available at the time when the language model is trained, but rather becomes available little by little over time. We demonstrate that the implicit interpolation carried out by applying curriculum learning methods to rnnlms outperforms conventional interpolation and has the potential to make more of less adaptation data. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently developed innovative decision support systems (DSS) aim to achieve optimum results while minimizing the risks of serious losses. The purpose of the DSS is to help the decision-maker facing the problem of huge amounts of data and ambiguous reactions of complicated systems depending on external factors. By means of accurate and profound analysis, DSSs are expected to provide the user with precisely forecasted indicators and optimal decisions. In this paper we suggest a new DSS structure which could be used in a wide range of difficult to formalize tasks and achieve a high speed of calculation and decision-making. We examine different approaches to determining the dependence of a target variable on input data and review the most common statistical forecasting methods. The advantages of using neural networks for this purpose are described. We suggest applying interval neural networks for calculations with underdetermined (interval) data, which makes it possible to use our DSS in a wide range of complicated tasks. We developed a corresponding learning algorithm for the interval neural networks. The advantages of using a genetic algorithm (GA) to select the most significant inputs are shown. We justify the use of general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) to achieve high-speed calculations with the decision support system in question. A functional diagram of the system is presented and described. The results and samples of the DSS application are demonstrated. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, companies are investing in tracking and tracing systems aiming to improve services, reduce costs and ensure the safety in cargo transportation. To play a part in this area, we propose in this article SafeTrack, a model for logistics management based on geofencing algorithms and radio-frequency technology. In this approach, the focus is on dealing with delivery management. The main scientific contribution of SafeTrack is automatic delivery management. Besides dealing with deliveries without user interaction, we provide a mechanism to detect inconsistencies at real-time. Furthermore, the model monitors detours in planned routes and deals with alarms notifications using mobile devices. To provide that features, we employed Geofence concept with two solutions that enable to detect, in real-time, the occurrence of detours in planned routes. We also created a component, named SafeDuino, to control loads delivery and pickups. The decision on the occurrence of inconsistencies during the logistics flow is performed through the fusion of context information, obtained from SafeDuino and a mobile device, using radio-frequency technology. We built a complete and functional prototype, which was evaluated in a controlled environment, testing several conditions. The test scenario was executed twenty times, showing that the proposed model is capable to identify all inconsistencies along the travels. We concluded that SafeTrack improves logistics operation, optimizing decision-making, avoiding losses during the logistics flow, and also allowing companies to remain competitive in the market. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The kinetics of treatment within these wetlands has not been previously characterized which contributes to uncertainties in performance expectations. A case study was conducted on a tundra wetland area receiving primary treated municipal wastewater in Coral Harbour, Nunavut, Canada. The objectives of the study were to: (i) develop a tanks-in-series (TIS) performance model to determine first order areal rate constants (k) for a tundra wetland treatment area; and (ii) compare the rate constants to published literature on treatment wetlands operating in more temperate climates. This study serves as a proof of concept and initial derivation of rate constants characteristic of a tundra wetland treatment area. A TIS performance model was modified to account for external hydrologic contributions. Tracer studies, hydraulic measurements, and water quality data were used to parameterize the model and fit first order rate constants for several wastewater parameters. Dilution from the external hydrologic contributions from the watershed of the wetland accounted for approximately 33% of the contaminant reductions observed. The fitted k values normalized to 20°C, and percentiles compared to literature, ranged from: 4.4-120m/y (5th-70th) for CBOD<inf>5</inf>; 78 -887m/y (40th-90th) for E. coli; 2.7 20m/y (10th-60th) for TN; and 12-64m/y (40th-80th) for TAN. In general, rate constants for this arctic tundra wetland were comparable to low rate constants derived from wetlands operating in non-arctic climates. © 2015 .","Canadian Arctic; Cold climate; Performance model; Rate constant; Tanks-in-series model; Tundra wetland; Wastewater treatment","(2000) Guidelines for the approval and design of natural and constructed treatment wetlands for water quality, , Municipal Program Development Branch.

Thus far, both targeted and wide-area surveys have yet to detect artificial signals from intelligent civilisations. In this paper, I argue that the incidence of co-existing intelligent and communicating civilisations is probably small in the Milky Way. While this makes successful SETI searches a very difficult pursuit indeed, the huge impact of even a single detection requires us to continue the search. A substantial increase in the overall performance of radio telescopes (and in particular future wide-field instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array-SKA), provide renewed optimism in the field. Evidence for this is already to be seen in the success of SETI researchers in acquiring observations on some of the world's most sensitive radio telescope facilities via open, peer-reviewed processes. The increasing interest in the dynamic radio sky, and our ability to detect new and rapid transient phenomena such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) is also greatly encouraging. While the nature of FRBs is not yet fully understood, I argue they are unlikely to be the signature of distant extra-terrestrial civilisations. As astronomers face a data avalanche on all sides, advances made in related areas such as advanced Big Data analytics, and cognitive computing are crucial to enable serendipitous discoveries to be made. In any case, as the era of the SKA fast approaches, the prospects of a SETI detection have never been better. © 2015 IAA.","Fast Radio Bursts (FRB); Radio astronomy; SETI; SKA","Cocconi, G., Morrison, P., (1959) Nature, 184, p. 844; Drake, F.D., (1961) Phys.

The proposed strategy is benchmarked on noise-free, noisy, and field data. For verification, the results of the GWO algorithm are compared to genetic algorithm (GA), the hybrid algorithm (PSOGSA)-the combination of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), and gradient-based algorithm. Results from both synthetic and real data demonstrate that GWO applied to surface wave analysis can show a good balance between exploration and exploitation that results in high local optima avoidance and a very fast convergence simultaneously. The great advantages of GWO are that the algorithm is simple, flexible, robust and easy to implement. Also there are fewer control parameters to tune. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Dispersion curves; Grey Wolf Optimizer; Rayleigh waves; Surface waves; Swarm intelligence","Park, C.B., Miller, R.D., Xia, J., Multichannel analysis of surface waves (1999) Geophysics, 64 (3), pp. 800-808; Xia, J., Miller, R.D., Park, C.B., Estimation of near-surface shear-wave velocity by inversion of Rayleigh wave (1999) Geophysics, 64 (3), pp. 691-700; Zeng, C., Xia, J., Miller, R.D., Tsoflias, G.P., Application of the multiaxial perfectly matched layer (MPML) to near-surface seismic modeling with Rayleigh waves (2011) Geophysics, 76 (3), pp. T43-T52; Socco, L.V., Foti, S., Boiero, D., Surface-wave analysis for building near-surface velocity models-established approaches and new perspectives (2010) Geophysics, 75 (5), pp. A83-A102; Miller, R.D., Xia, J., Park, C.B., Ivanov, J., Multichannel analysis of surface waves to map bedrock (1999) Lead.

Most of hybrid models to address this challenge have either deleted the missing instances from the data set (popularly known as case deletion) or have used some default way to fill the missing values. This paper, presents a novel hybrid prediction model with missing value imputation (HPM-MI) that analyze various imputation techniques using simple K-means clustering and apply the best one to a data set. The proposed hybrid model is the first one to use combination of K-means clustering with Multilayer Perceptron. K-means clustering is also used to validate class labels of given data (incorrectly classified instances are deleted i.e. pattern extracted from original data) before applying classifier. The proposed system has significantly improved data quality by use of best imputation technique after quantitative analysis of eleven imputation approaches. The efficiency of proposed model as predictive classification system is investigated on three benchmark medical data sets namely Pima Indians Diabetes, Wisconsin Breast Cancer, and Hepatitis from the UCI Repository of Machine Learning. In addition to accuracy, sensitivity, specificity; kappa statistics and the area under ROC are also computed. The experimental results show HPM-MI has produced accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, kappa and ROC as 99.82%, 100%, 99.74%, 0.996 and 1.0 respectively for Pima Indian Diabetes data set, 99.39%, 99.31%, 99.54%, 0.986, and 1.0 respectively for breast cancer data set and 99.08%, 100%, 96.55%, 0.978 and 0.99 respectively for Hepatitis data set. Results are best in comparison with existing methods. Further, the performance of our model is measured and analyzed as function of missing rate and train-test ratio using 2D synthetic data set and Wisconsin Diagnostics Breast Cancer Data Sets. Results are promising and therefore the proposed model will be very useful in prediction for medical domain especially when numbers of missing value are large in the data set. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This yields a partial global Lanczos decomposition of A. We show that for suitable functions f upper and lower bounds for If can be determined by exploiting the connection between the global block Lanczos method and Gauss-type quadrature rules. Our approach generalizes techniques advocated by Golub and Meurant for the standard Lanczos method (with block size one) to the global block Lanczos method. We describe applications to the computation of upper and lower bounds of the trace of f(A) and consider, in particular, the computation of upper and lower bounds for the Estrada index, which arises in network analysis. We also discuss an application to machine learning. © 2015 IMACS.","Gauss quadrature; Global block; Lanczos algorithm; Machine learning; Network analysis; Trace computation","Avron, H., Toledo, S., Randomized algorithms for estimating the trace of an implicit symmetric positive semi-definite matrix (2011) J.

Two opportunities for Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) parallelization of MCMC sampling for probabilistic graphical models are presented. In exchangeable models with many observations such as Bayesian Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), child-node contributions to the conditional posterior of each node can be calculated concurrently. In undirected graphs with discrete-value nodes, concurrent sampling of conditionally-independent nodes can be transformed into a SIMD form. High-performance libraries with multi-threading and vectorization capabilities can be readily applied to such SIMD opportunities to gain decent speedup, while a series of high-level source-code and runtime modifications provide further performance boost by reducing parallelization overhead and increasing data locality for Non-Uniform Memory Access architectures. For big-data Bayesian GLM graphs, the end-result is a routine for evaluating the conditional posterior and its gradient vector that is 5 times faster than a naive implementation using (built-in) multi-threaded Intel MKL BLAS, and reaches within the striking distance of the memory-bandwidth-induced hardware limit. Using multi-threading for cache-friendly, fine-grained parallelization can outperform coarse-grained alternatives which are often less cache-friendly, a likely scenario in modern predictive analytics workflow such as Hierarchical Bayesian GLM, variable selection, and ensemble regression and classification. The proposed optimization strategies improve the scaling of performance with number of cores and width of vector units (applicable to many-core SIMD processors such as Intel Xeon Phi and Graphic Processing Units), resulting in cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency ('green computing'), and higher speed on multi-core x86 processors. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The fundamental idea behind transform compression is to exploit regularity within signals such that redundancy is minimized subject to a fidelity cost. Multimedia signals, in particular images and video, are well known to contain a diverse set of localized structures, leading to many different types of regularity and to nonstationary signal statistics. The proposed method designs sparse orthonormal transforms (SOTs) that automatically exploit regularity over different signal structures and provides an adaptation method that determines the best representation over localized regions. Unlike earlier work that is motivated by linear approximation constructs and model-based designs that are limited to specific types of signal regularity, our work uses general nonlinear approximation ideas and a data-driven setup to significantly broaden its reach. We show that our SOT designs provide a safe and principled extension of the Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) by reducing to the KLT on Gaussian processes and by automatically exploiting non-Gaussian statistics to significantly improve over the KLT on more general processes. We provide an algebraic optimization framework that generates optimized designs for any desired transform structure (multiresolution, block, lapped, and so on) with significantly better $n$ -term approximation performance. For each structure, we propose a new prototype codec and test over a database of images. Simulation results show consistent increase in compression and approximation performance compared with conventional methods. © 1992-2012 IEEE.","image compression; linear representation; machine learning; nonlinear approximation; sparse lapped transforms; sparse multi-resolution transforms; sparse orthonormal transforms; transform optimization","Proof-of-Concept Software, , http://eeweb.poly.edu/~onur/source.html, [Online] Available; Aharon, M., Elad, M., Bruckstein, A.M., K-SVD and its non-negative variant for dictionary design (2005) Proc.

Particularly, these data driven approaches show promise when tackling the challenge of mapping landslide prone areas for large regions, which may not have sufficient geotechnical data to conduct physically-based methods. Currently, there is no best method for empirical susceptibility modeling. Therefore, this study presents a comparison of traditional statistical and novel machine learning models applied for regional scale landslide susceptibility modeling. These methods were evaluated by spatial k-fold cross-validation estimation of the predictive performance, assessment of variable importance for gaining insights into model behavior and by the appearance of the prediction (i.e. susceptibility) map. The modeling techniques applied were logistic regression (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM), weights of evidence (WOE), the support vector machine (SVM), random forest classification (RF), and bootstrap aggregated classification trees (bundling) with penalized discriminant analysis (BPLDA). These modeling methods were tested for three areas in the province of Lower Austria, Austria. The areas are characterized by different geological and morphological settings.Random forest and bundling classification techniques had the overall best predictive performances. However, the performances of all modeling techniques were for the majority not significantly different from each other; depending on the areas of interest, the overall median estimated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) differences ranged from 2.9 to 8.9 percentage points. The overall median estimated true positive rate (TPR) measured at a 10% false positive rate (FPR) differences ranged from 11 to 15pp. The relative importance of each predictor was generally different between the modeling methods. However, slope angle, surface roughness and plan curvature were consistently highly ranked variables. The prediction methods that create splits in the predictors (RF, BPLDA and WOE) resulted in heterogeneous prediction maps full of spatial artifacts. In contrast, the GAM, GLM and SVM produced smooth prediction surfaces. Overall, it is suggested that the framework of this model evaluation approach can be applied to assist in selection of a suitable landslide susceptibility modeling technique. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Landslide susceptibility modeling; Spatial cross-validation; Statistical and machine learning techniques; Variable importance","Agterberg, F.P., Cheng, Q., Conditional independence test for weights-of-evidence modeling (2002) Nat.

Due to its nature MELC is especially well adapted to deal with unbalanced data. As the consequence of both used model and the applied density regularization technique, it shows strong regularization properties and therefore is almost unable to overfit. Moreover, contrary to SVM, in its basic form it has no free parameters, however, at the cost of being a non-convex optimization problem which results in the existence of local optima and the possible need for multiple initializations. In practice, MELC obtained similar or higher scores than the ones given by SVM on both synthetic and real data from the UCI repository. We also perform experimental evaluation of proposed method as a part of expert system designed for drug discovery problem. It appears that not only MELC achieves better results than SVM but also gives some additional insights into data structure, resulting in more complex decision support system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Classification;

Thus, various machine learning and pattern recognition techniques have been proposed to detect breast cancer. One of these techniques is the Bayes classifier. Naïve Bayesian (NB) is known to be a simple classifier, which is based on the Bayes theorem. There have been so many applications used in literature. In this paper, a new NB (weighted NB) classifier was proposed and its application on breast cancer detection was presented. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the weighted NB on the breast cancer database. The experiments were realized with 5-fold cross validation test. Moreover, various performance evaluation techniques namely sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are considered. According to the experiments, the weighted NB obtained the following evaluation values. The calculated sensitivity, specificity and the accuracy values are 99.11%, 98.25%, and 98.54% respectively. Moreover, a comparison with the existing methods in the literature was presented. As a result, the performance of weighted NB is better than regular NB and many other existing methods. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, studies have suggested the use of ensemble strategies to enhance credit modelling performance. However, accuracy is obtained at the expense of interpretability, leading to the reluctance of financial industry to employ ensemble models in favour of simpler models. In this work we introduce an ensemble approach based on merged decision trees, the correlated-adjusted decision forest (CADF), to produce both accurate and comprehensible models. As main innovation, our proposal explores the combination of complementary sources of diversity as mechanisms to optimise model's structure, which leads to a manageable number of comprehensive decision rules without sacrificing performance. We evaluate our approach in comparison to individual classifiers and alternative ensemble strategies (gradient boosting, random forests). Empirical results suggest CADF is an encouraging solution for credit risk problems, being able to compete in accuracy with much complex proposals while producing a rule-based structure directly useful for managerial decisions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The model, based on the k-nearest-neighbors (. kNN) algorithm, predicts the global (GHI) and direct (DNI) components of irradiance for horizons ranging from 5min up to 30min, and the corresponding uncertainty prediction intervals. An optimization algorithm determines the best set of patterns and other free parameters in the model, such as the number of nearest neighbors. Results show that the model achieves significant forecast improvements (between 10% and 25%) over a reference persistence forecast. The results show that large ramps in the irradiance time series are not very well capture by the point forecasts, mostly because those events are underrepresented in the historical dataset. The inclusion of sky images in the pattern recognition results in a small improvement (below 5%) relative to the kNN without images, but it helps in the definition of the uncertainty intervals (specially in the case of DNI). The prediction intervals determined with this method show good performance, with high probability coverage (≈90% for GHI and ≈85% for DNI) and narrow average normalized width (≈8% for GHI and ≈17% for DNI). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Global and direct irradiance; K-nearest-neighbors; Machine learning; Smart solar forecasting","Akbari, M., Overloop, P., Afshar, A., Clustered k nearest neighbor algorithm for daily inflow forecasting (2011) Water Resour Manag, 25 (5), pp. 1341-1357; Bannayan, M., Hoogenboom, G., Predicting realizations of daily weather data for climate forecasts using the non-parametric nearest-neighbour re-sampling technique (2008) Int J Climatol, 28 (10), pp. 1357-1368; Bossavy, A., Girard, R., Kariniotakis, G., Forecasting ramps of wind power production with numerical weather prediction ensembles (2013) Wind Energy, 16 (1), pp. 51-63; Brabec, M., Badescu, V., Paulescu, M., Nowcasting sunshine number using logistic modeling (2013) Meteorol Atmos Phys, 120 (1-2), pp. 61-71; Brabec, M., Paulescu, M., Badescu, V., Generalized additive models for nowcasting cloud shading (2014) Sol Energy, 101, pp. 272-282; Bracale, A., Caramia, P., Carpinelli, G., Di Fazio, A.R., Ferruzzi, G., Abayesian method for short-term probabilistic forecasting of photovoltaic generation in smart grid operation and control (2013) Energies, 6 (2), pp. 733-747; Chatfield, C., Calculating interval forecasts (1993) JBus Econ Statistics, 11 (2), pp. 121-135; Chow, C.W., Urquhart, B., Lave, M., Dominguez, A., Kleissl, J., Shields, J., Intra-hour forecasting with a total sky imager at the UC San Diego solar energy testbed (2011) Sol Energy, 85 (11), pp. 2881-2893; Chu, Y., Pedro, H.T.C., Coimbra, C.F.M., Hybrid intra-hour DNI forecasts with sky image processing enhanced by stochastic learning (2013) Sol Energy, 98, pp. 592-603; Chu, Y., Pedro, H.T.C., Nonnenmacher, L., Inman, R.H., Liao, Z., Coimbra, C.F.M., Asmart image-based cloud detection system for intrahour solar irradiance forecasts (2014) JAtmos Ocean Technol, 31 (9), pp. 1995-2007; Crispim, E.M., Ferreira, P.M., Ruano, A.E., Prediction of the solar radiation evolution using computational intelligence techniques and cloudiness indices (2008) Int J Innov Comput Inf Control, 4 (5), pp. 1121-1133; Dong, Z., Yang, D., Reindl, T., Walsh, W.M., Short-term solar irradiance forecasting using exponential smoothing state space model (2013) Energy, 55, pp. 1104-1113; Ferreira, P., Gomes, J., Martins, I., Ruano, A., Aneural network based intelligent predictive sensor for cloudiness, solar radiation and air temperature (2012) Sensors, 12, pp. 15750-15777; Ineichen, P., Abroadband simplified version of the solis clear sky model (2008) Sol Energy, 82, pp. 758-762; Inman, R.H., Pedro, H.T.C., Coimbra, C.F.M., Solar forecasting methods for renewable energy integration (2013) Prog Energy Combust Sci, 39 (6), pp. 535-576; Iversen, E.B., Morales, J.M., Mller, J.K., Madsen, H., Probabilistic forecasts of solar irradiance using stochastic differential equations (2014) Environmetrics, 25 (3), pp. 152-164; Khosravi, A., Nahavandi, S., Creighton, D., Prediction intervals for short-term wind farm power generation forecasts (2013) IEEE Trans Sustain Energy, 4 (3), pp. 602-610; Lora, A., Santos, J., Santos, J., Ramos, J., Exposito, A., Electricity market price forecasting: neural networks versus weighted-distance k nearest neighbours (2002) Database and expert systems applications.

However, the space of algorithms for learning from such human reward has hitherto not been explored systematically. Using model-based reinforcement learning from human reward, this article investigates the problem of learning from human reward through six experiments, focusing on the relationships between reward positivity, which is how generally positive a trainer's reward values are; temporal discounting, the extent to which future reward is discounted in value; episodicity, whether task learning occurs in discrete learning episodes instead of one continuing session; and task performance, the agent's performance on the task the trainer intends to teach. This investigation is motivated by the observation that an agent can pursue different learning objectives, leading to different resulting behaviors. We search for learning objectives that lead the agent to behave as the trainer intends. We identify and empirically support a ""positive circuits"" problem with low discounting (i.e., high discount factors) for episodic, goal-based tasks that arises from an observed bias among humans towards giving positive reward, resulting in an endorsement of myopic learning for such domains. We then show that converting simple episodic tasks to be non-episodic (i.e., continuing) reduces and in some cases resolves issues present in episodic tasks with generally positive reward and - relatedly - enables highly successful learning with non-myopic valuation in multiple user studies. The primary learning algorithm introduced in this article, which we call ""vi-tamer"", is the first algorithm to successfully learn non-myopically from reward generated by a human trainer; we also empirically show that such non-myopic valuation facilitates higher-level understanding of the task. Anticipating the complexity of real-world problems, we perform further studies - one with a failure state added - that compare (1) learning when states are updated asynchronously with local bias - i.e., states quickly reachable from the agent's current state are updated more often than other states - to (2) learning with the fully synchronous sweeps across each state in the vi-tamer algorithm. With these locally biased updates, we find that the general positivity of human reward creates problems even for continuing tasks, revealing a distinct research challenge for future work. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is often criticised for its lack of interactivity, not only in the application of decisions but also in the display of results. This paper presents the simulation interface of software with management strategy evaluation capabilities and its capacity to enable resource managers to learn about water quality management as evaluated in a workshop setting. The software 'MSE Tool' is not intended to produce definitive real-world advice but provides a test-bed for managers to interactively design strategies and explore the complexities inherent to water quality management using a simple, yet effective, user interface. MSE Tool has been used in a pilot application that simulated the effects of management strategies applied in catchments and their effects on riverine, estuarine and marine water quality in South East Queensland, Australia. The approach and the software are suitable for reuse in other management strategy evaluation projects. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Decision support system; DSS; EDSS; Interaction; Learning; Management strategy evaluation; Simulation interface; South East Queensland; User interactivity; Water quality","Abal, E.G., Dennison, W.C., Bunn, S.E., Healthy Waterways Healthy Catchments: Making the Connection in South East Queensland (2005), p. 222. , Moreton Bay Waterways and Catchment Partnership, Brisbane, AustraliaAlam, K., Rolfe, J., Donaghy, P., An economic analysis of improved water quality (2006) In 50th Annual Conference of the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society, Manly, Sydney; Alam, K., Rolfe, J., Donaghy, P., Economic and social impact assessment of water quality improvement (2006) Australas.

These include single cell sequencing, flow cytometry and multiparametric imaging approaches and open unprecedented possibilities to learn about the heterogeneity, dynamics and interplay of the different cell types which constitute tissues and multicellular organisms. Statistical and dynamic systems theory approaches have been applied to quantitatively describe a variety of cellular processes, such as transcription and cell signaling. Machine learning approaches have been developed to define cell types, their mutual relationships, and differentiation hierarchies shaping heterogeneous cell populations, yielding insights into topics such as, for example, immune cell differentiation and tumor cell type composition.

To this end, two different Computational Intelligence approaches are herein evaluated: (1) a modified Harmony Search (HS) optimization algorithm with an exponential prediction model and (2) an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). In the case of the HS, a feature selection of the best set of features for the prediction is carried out jointly with the optimization of the model's parameters. On the other hand, the ELM will be tested with and without the feature selection carried out by the HS approach. We describe several modifications on the proposed HS, which include a hybrid encoding with a binary part for the feature selection, and a real part to tune the parameters of the prediction model. Other adaptations focused on the HS operators are also introduced. The performance of both approaches has been assessed in a real application scenario, corresponding to the total energy demand estimation in Spain, in which we have 14 macroeconomic variables with history values for the last 30 years, including the recent crisis period starting in 2008. The performance of the proposed HS and ELM models incorporating feature selection is shown to provide an accurate one-year-ahead forecast at a higher prediction's accuracy when compared to previous proposals in the literature. Specifically, the HS and ELM approaches are able to improve the results of a previous approach (based on a genetic algorithm), obtaining an improvement over 15% in this problem of energy demand estimation. As a final experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm, a similar problem of one-year ahead CO<inf>2</inf> emissions estimation from macro-economic variables is also tackled, and also in this case the HS and ELM are able to obtain significant improvements over a previous approach based on evolutionary computation, over 10% of improvement in this problem. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Computational intelligence; Energy demand estimation; Extreme Learning Machines; Harmony Search","Suganthi, L., Samuel, A.A., Energy models for demand forecasting - A review (2012) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 16, pp. 1223-1240; (2007) Energy Transformed: Sustainable Energy Solutions for Climate Change Mitigation, p. 6. , CSIRO and the Natural Edge Project; Ceylan, H., Ozturk, H.K., Estimating energy demand of Turkey based on economic indicators using genetic algorithm approach (2004) Energy Convers Manage, 45, pp. 2525-2537; Ünler, A., Improvement of energy demand forecasts using swarm intelligence: The case of Turkey with projections to 2025 (2008) Energy Policy, 36, pp. 1937-1944; Kiran, M.S., Özceylan, E., Gündüz, M., Paksoy, T., Swarm intelligence approaches to estimate electricity energy demand in Turkey (2012) Knowl-Based Syst, 36, pp. 93-103; Yu, S., Zhu, K.J., A hybrid procedure for energy demand forecasting in China (2012) Energy, 37, pp. 396-404; Kiran, M.S., Özceylan, E., Gündüz, M., Paksoy, T., A novel hybrid approach based on particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization to forecast energy demand of Turkey (2012) Energy Convers Manage, 53, pp. 75-83; Yu, S., Wei, Y.M., Wang, K., A PSO-GA optimal model to estimate primary energy demand of China (2012) Energy Policy, 42, pp. 329-340; Rager, M., Gahm, C., Denz, F., Energy-oriented scheduling based on evolutionary algorithms (2015) Comput Oper Res, 54, pp. 218-231; Yu, S., Zhu, K., Zhang, X., Energy demand projection of China using a path-coefficient analysis and PSO-GA approach (2012) Energy Convers Manage, 53, pp. 142-153; Piltan, M., Shiri, H., Ghaderi, S.F., Energy demand forecasting in Iranian metal industry using linear and nonlinear models based on evolutionary algorithms (2012) Energy Convers Manage, 58, pp. 1-9; Geem, Z.W., Hoon Kim, J., Loganathan, G.V., A new heuristic optimization algorithm: Harmony search (2001) Simulation, 76 (2), pp. 60-68; Manjarres, D., Landa-Torres, I., Gil-Lopez, S., Del Ser, J., Bilbao, M.N., Salcedo-Sanz, S., A survey on applications of the harmony search algorithm (2013) Eng Appl Artif Intell, 26, pp. 1818-1831; Blum, A., Langley, P., Selection of relevant features and examples in machine learning (1997) Artif Intell, 97, pp. 245-271; Weston, H., Mukherjee, S., Chapelle, O., Pontil, M., Poggio, T., Vapnik, V., Feature selection for SVMs (2000) Advances in NIPS 12, pp. 526-532. , MIT Press; Kohavi, R., John, G.H., Wrappers for features subset selection (1997) Int J Digit Libr, 1, pp. 108-121; Geem, Z.W., Novel derivative of harmony search algorithm for discrete design variables (2008) Appl Math Comput, 199 (1), pp. 223-230; Geem, Z.W., Sim, K.B., Parameter-setting-free harmony search algorithm (2010) Appl Math Comput, 217 (8), pp. 3881-3889; Salcedo-Sanz, S., Camps-Valls, G., Pérez-Cruz, F., Sepúlveda-Sanchis, J., Bousoño-Calzón, C., Enhancing genetic feature selection through restricted search and Walsh analysis (2004) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybernet - Part C, 34 (4); Wang, L., Yang, R., Xu, Y., Niu, Q., Pardalos, P.M., Fei, M., An improved adaptive binary harmony search algorithm (2013) Inform Sci, 232, pp. 58-87; Huang, G.B., Zhu, Q.Y., Siew, C.K., Extreme learning machine: Theory and applications (2006) Neurocomputing, 70 (1), pp. 489-501; Huang, G.B., Wang, D.H., Lan, Y., Extreme learning machines: A survey (2011) Int J Mach Learn Cybernet, 2 (2), pp. 107-122; Huang, G.B., Chen, L., Convex incremental extreme learning machine (2007) Neurocomputing, 70, pp. 3056-3062; Huang, G.B., Chen, L., Enhanced random search based incremental extreme learning machine (2008) Neurocomputing, 71, pp. 3460-3468; Huang, G.B., Chen, L., Siew, C.K., Universal approximation using incremental constructive feedforward networks with random hidden nodes (2006) IEEE Trans Neural Netw, 17 (4), pp. 879-892; Meng, M., Niu, D., Shang, W., A small-sample hybrid model for forecasting energy-related CO <inf>2</inf> emissions (2014) Energy, 64, pp. 673-677; Pao, H.T., Fu, H.C., Tseng, C.L., Forecasting of CO <inf>2</inf> emissions, energy consumption and economic growth in China using and improved grey model (2012) Energy, 40, pp. 400-409",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928501379

In this paper, we formulate a new approach for obtaining better learning paths for different learners groups as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) in which meta-data and competencies are used to define the relationships between the learning objects (LOs), where the course materials are used to formulate LOs sequence. The main aim of this paper is to obtain a dynamic learning path for the considered CSP problem by using the swarm intelligence technique, which is a sub-set of the artificial intelligence technique. Further, the proposed model is tested in a simulated environment, which gives an optimized LO sequencing. The simulation results reveal that the artificial ants gives solution to the proposed problem in an optimized way. More precisely, suitable learning path can be obtained by applying ant colony optimization (ACO) technique. From the obtained results it is concluded that the proposed model supports the e-learning portal administrator in getting benefits in terms of less processing time and minimal sequencing cost. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, BA may be poor in balancing exploitation and exploration for certain problems and thus may become trapped in local optima with loss of population diversity. In this paper, by introducing a double subgroup (external exploration subgroup and internal exploitation subgroup) with a dynamic transition strategy to improve the global exploring ability and local exploiting ability of BA, we propose an improved double-subpopulation Lévy flight bat algorithm called DLBA. The external subgroup updates positions using a dynamic weight model and the internal subgroup uses a Lévy flight model. To mitigate a loss of diversity, DLBA enables mutation with mutation probability Mp in the external subgroup when the diversity drops below a given threshold. Several other improvements, such as selection strategy and loudness updating formulae, are also introduced. Our results from tests on a set of numerical benchmark functions indicate that DLBA can outperform other algorithms in most of our experiments. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Bat algorithm; Diversity; DLBA; Double-subgroup; Mutation; Swarm intelligence","Yang, X.-S., Gandomi, A.H., Bat algorithm: A novel approach for global engineering optimization (2012) Eng.

The present study analyzes the spatial variability of climate change impacts on groundnut yields in the Anantapur district of India and examines the relative contribution of adaptation strategies. For this purpose, a web based decision support tool that integrates crop simulation model and Geographical Information System (GIS) was developed to assist agronomic decision making and this tool can be scalable to any location and crop. The climate change projections of five global climate models (GCMs) relative to the 1980-2010 baseline for Anantapur district indicates an increase in rainfall activity to the tune of 10.6 to 25% during Mid-century period (2040-69) with RCP 8.5. The GCMs also predict warming exceeding 1.4 to 2.4. °C by 2069 in the study region. The spatial crop responses to the projected climate indicate a decrease in groundnut yields with four GCMs (MPI-ESM-MR, MIROC5, CCSM4 and HadGEM2-ES) and a contrasting 6.3% increase with the GCM, GFDL-ESM2M. The simulation studies using CROPGRO-Peanut model reveals that groundnut yields can be increased on average by 1.0%, 5.0%, 14.4%, and 20.2%, by adopting adaptation options of heat tolerance, drought tolerant cultivars, supplemental irrigation and a combination of drought tolerance cultivar and supplemental irrigation respectively. The spatial patterns of relative benefits of adaptation options were geographically different and the greatest benefits can be achieved by adopting new cultivars having drought tolerance and with the application of one supplemental irrigation at 60. days after sowing. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change factors; Crop simulation; DSSAT; Virtual cultivars; Yield","Bapuji Rao, B., Ramana Rao, B.V., Subba Rao, A.V.M., Manikandan, N., Narasimha Rao, S.B.S., Rao, V.U.M., Venkateswarlu, B., Assessment of the impact of increasing temperature and rainfall variability on crop productivity in drylands - an illustrative approach (2011) Research Bulletin 1/2011, p. 32. , Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, Santoshnagar, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; Behera, S.K., Panda, R.K., Integrated management of irrigation water and fertilizers for wheat crop using field experiments and simulation modeling (2009) Agric.

The molecular design problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model in which a solvent performance measure is maximized (solute distribution coefficient) subject to structural feasibility, property, and process constraints. In developing the EACO algorithm, the better uniformity property of Hammersley sequence sampling (HSS) is exploited. The capabilities of the proposed methodology are illustrated using a real world case study for the design of an optimal solvent for extraction of acetic acid from waste process stream using liquid-liquid extraction. The UNIFAC model based on the infinite dilution activity coefficient is used to estimate the mixture properties. New solvents with better targeted properties are proposed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Ant colony optimization; Computer aided molecular design; Group contribution method; Hammersley sequence sampling; Oracle penalty function; UNIFAC","Achenie, L.E.K., Sinha, M., Interval global optimization in solvent design (2003) Reliable Comput, 9, pp. 317-338; Alvarado-Morales, M., Terra, J., Gernaey, K.V., Woodley, J.M., Gani, R.R., Biorefining: computer aided tools for sustainable design and analysis of bioethanol production (2009) Chem Eng Res Des, 87, pp. 1171-1183; Chemmangattuvalappil, N.G., Eljack, F.T., Solvason, C.C., Eden, M.R., A novel algorithm for molecular synthesis using enhanced property operators (2009) Comput Chem Eng, 33, pp. 636-643; Cheng, H.C., Wang, F.S., Optimal biocompatible solvent design for a two-stage extractive fermentation process with cell recycling (2008) Comput Chem Eng, 32, pp. 1385-1396; Diwekar, U., Xu, W., Improved genetic algorithms for deterministic optimization and optimization under uncertainty.

The common characteristics of all these algorithms is their collective intelligence and adaptability to a changing environment. Due to their efficiency and simplicity, these algorithms have been employed for problem solving across social and natural sciences. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that nature-inspired algorithms are also useful within the domain of sport, in particular for obtaining safe and effective training plans targeting various aspects of performance.

In recent years, several ABC variants that modify some components of the original ABC algorithm have been proposed. Although there are some comparison studies in the literature, the individual contribution of each proposed modification is often unknown. In this paper, the proposed modifications are tested with a systematic experimental study that by a component-wise analysis tries to identify their impact on algorithm performance. This study is done on two benchmark sets in continuous optimization. In addition to this analysis, two new variants of ABC algorithms for each of the two benchmark sets are proposed. To do so, the best components are selected for each step of the Composite ABC algorithms. The performance of the proposed algorithms were compared against that of ten recent ABC algorithms, as well as against several recent state-of-the-art algorithms. The comparison results showed that our proposed algorithms outperform other ABC algorithms. Moreover, the composite ABC algorithms are superior to several state-of-the-art algorithms proposed in the literature. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed approach is based on a sequence of two different MOS. The first, called MOSRH, is a new physically based algorithm, built to correct the treatment of humidity in the WRF radiation schemes. The second, called MOSNN, is based on artificial intelligence techniques and aims to correct the main systematic and learnable errors of the Numerical Weather Prediction output. The 1-day and 2-day forecast accuracies are analyzed via direct comparison with irradiance data measured in two sites, Rome and Lugano. The paper shows that a considerable reduction in error was achieved using MOSRH model and MOS cascade. The differences between the two sites are discussed in details. Finally, the results obtained are compared with the benchmark accuracy reached for the data available for the average climate in Southern Spain and Switzerland. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Forecast; Model output statistics; Photovoltaic; Solar irradiance","Arakawa, A., Lamb, V.R., Computational design of the basic dynamical processes of the UCLA general circulation model (1977) Meth.

Both motion and appearance information are considered, so as to robustly distinguish different kinds of anomalies, for a wide range of scenarios. A newly introduced concept based on swarm theory, histograms of oriented swarms (HOS), is applied to capture the dynamics of crowded environments. HOS, together with the well-known histograms of oriented gradients, are combined to build a descriptor that effectively characterizes each scene. These appearance and motion features are only extracted within spatiotemporal volumes of moving pixels to ensure robustness to local noise, increase accuracy in the detection of local, nondominant anomalies, and achieve a lower computational cost. Experiments on benchmark data sets containing various situations with human crowds, as well as on traffic data, led to results that surpassed the current state of the art (SoA), confirming the method's efficacy and generality. Finally, the experiments show that our approach achieves significantly higher accuracy, especially for pixel-level event detection compared to SoA methods, at a low computational cost. © 2015 IEEE.","anomaly; crowd; swarm intelligence; traffic","Raghavendra, R., Del Bue, A., Cristani, M., Murino, V., Optimizing interaction force for global anomaly detection in crowded scenes (2011) Proc.

These control the quality of a reservoir model with effect on wells production behavior and prediction performance.In this study, the routine/SCAL core data and petrophysical/production log with prior sequence stratigraphy study of an Iranian gas carbonate reservoir were examined for proper multi-scale permeability modeling, consistent selection of reservoir rock-type classes and profile of hydraulic flow units. The considered reservoir has a very heterogeneous nature with Dykstra-Parsons coefficient of 0.98.The permeability was correlated to the porosity data using the Discrete Rock Type (. DRT) concept. The DRT was used just for correlation purpose and was not considered as Reservoir Rock Type. The DRT itself was calculated from well log data (for permeability determination) by applying an artificial intelligence technique known as Local Linear Neuro-Fuzzy Model (LLNFM). The model was trained a priori.The reservoir rock-type classes were selected using routine and special core data complemented with thin section analysis results. A scheme mainly based on rock hydraulic concept (derived from the hydraulic-pore-throat size obtained from core mercury injection tests) proved practical by identifying the Petrophysical Rock Type class (PRT). Each PRT class may be divided to Reservoir Rock Type (RRT) classes by considering the effect of rock wettability. However, the PRT classes are essentially the RRT classes in gas reservoirs since the rock is water wet.The formation layering was carried out using the concept of sequence stratigraphy and the layering was subdivided into hydraulic flow units (HFU). The distribution of PRT classes across the reservoir sections was also investigated. This was carried out based on the core permeability (near wellbore) and the permeability derived from Production Logging and DST data (well drainage volume). Boost factors were obtained and applied to match the near wellbore core-based permeability to that of the DST/. PLT results. This proved to minimize the mismatch between the simulation results and production history. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Hydraulic flow unit; Local linear neuro-fuzzy; Permeability; Porosity; Reservoir rock typing","Abdulraheem, A., Sabakhi, E., Ahmed, M., Vantala, A., Raharja, I., Korvin, G., Estimation of permeability from wireline logs in a Middle Eastern carbonate reservoir using fuzzy logic.

We apply this technique to the case of the Lorenz attractor and evolve several new chaotic attractors based on the basic Lorenz template. The MGGP algorithm automatically finds new nonlinear expressions for the different state variables starting from the original Lorenz system. The Lyapunov exponents of each of the attractors are calculated numerically based on the time series of the state variables using time delay embedding techniques. The MGGP algorithm tries to search the functional space of the attractors by aiming to maximise the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) of the evolved attractors. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology, we report over one hundred new chaotic attractor structures along with their parameters, which are evolved from just the Lorenz system alone. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It consists of two phases where all individuals are trained by a teacher in the first phase and interact with classmates to improve their knowledge level in the second phase. In this study, we propose a set of TLBO-based hybrid algorithms to solve the challenging combinatorial optimization problem, Quadratic Assignment. Individuals are trained with recombination operators and later a Robust Tabu Search engine processes them. The performances of sequential and parallel TLBO-based hybrid algorithms are compared with those of state-of-the-art metaheuristics in terms of the best solution and computational effort. It is shown experimentally that the performance of the proposed algorithms are competitive with the best reported algorithms for the solution of the Quadratic Assignment Problem with which many real life problems can be modeled. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Hybrid algorithm; Quadratic assignment; Robust tabu; Stagnation; Teaching-learning","Adl, R.K., Rankoohi, S.M.T.R., A new ant colony optimization based algorithm for data allocation problem in distributed databases (2009) Knowledge Information Systems, 20 (3), pp. 349-373; Ahrari, A., Atai, A.A., Grenade explosion method: A novel tool for optimization of multimodal functions (2010) Applied Soft Computing, 10 (4), pp. 1132-1140; Ahuja, R.K., Orlin, J.B., Tiwari, A., A greedy genetic algorithm for the quadratic assignment problem (2000) Computers and Operations Research, 27, pp. 917-934; Anstreicher, K., Brixius, N.W., Goux, J.-P., Linderoth, J., Solving large quadratic assignment problems on computational grids (2002) Mathematical Programming, 91 (3), pp. 563-588; Burkard, R.E., Karisch, S.E., Rendl, F., QAPLIB a quadratic assignment problem library (1991) European Journal of Operational Research, 55 (1), pp. 115-119; Calzon-Bousono, C., The Hopfield neural network applied to the quadratic assignment problem (1995) Neural Computing and Applications, 3 (2), pp. 64-72; Carraresi, P., Malucelli, F., A new lower bound for the quadratic assignment problem (1992) Operations Research, 40 (1), pp. 22-27; Chakrapani, J., Skorin-Kapov, J., A connectionist approach to the quadratic assignment problem (1992) Computers and Operations Research, 19 (34), pp. 287-295; Clausen, J., Perregaard, M., Solving large quadratic assignment problems in parallel (1997) Computational Optimization and Applications, 8 (2), pp. 111-127; Connolly, D.T., An improved annealing scheme for the QAP (1990) European Journal of Operational Research, 46 (1), pp. 93-100; Cordeau, J.-F., Gaudioso, Laporte, M.G., Moccia, L., The service allocation problem at the Gioia Tauro Maritime Terminal (2007) European Journal of Operational Research, 176 (2), pp. 1167-1184; Crainic, T.G., Toulouse, M., Parallel strategies for metaheuristics (2003) Handbook of Metaheuristics, , F.

This was done using three supervised machine-learning algorithms (k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines and artificial neural networks) which were trained, cross-validated and tested. The validation areas included a high archaeological potential area (n=247 samples), the Dutch province of Zeeland (n=261 samples) and an excavated imprint of an ancient farmhouse (n=38 samples). The predictive models showed good overall performance and correctly classified about 95% of all test instances. According to the learning models, the first validation site has a top soil horizon that shows limited parallels with archaeological horizons used in model training, whereas features of high archaeological probability become more apparent below this horizon. This is in good correspondence with geochemical depth profiles and current archaeological interpretation. As for the second validation site, the models highlighted several archaeological hotspots that to some extend spatially coincide with areas of high archaeological potential as indicated by established predictive modelling. Reversely, the classifiers attributed high archaeological potential status to the most southern region of Zeeland, thereby complementing established modelling results. For the third validation site none of the instances were correctly classified and these results clearly show the limitations of geochemical predictive modelling of significantly different soil types (fine-to-coarse sands) compared to the training set (clayey sands).Present proof-of-concept study shows that modelling of multiple-source geochemical soil data using machine-learning algorithms can be successfully accomplished and that model predictions nicely complement current interpretation and/or established archeological predictive modelling of areas of archaeological interest. Limitations of our approach were found to reside in lithological differences between sites used for model training and prediction sites. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Archaeology; Geochemistry; Machine-learning; Predictive modelling; Soil","Abedi, M., Norouzi, G.-H., Bahroudi, A., Support vector machine for multi-classification of mineral prospectivity areas (2012) Comput.

Precise and timely identification of MI and extent of muscle damage helps in early treatment and reduction in the time taken for further tests. MI diagnosis using 2D echocardiography is prone to inter-/intra-observer variability in the assessment. Therefore, a computerised scheme based on image processing and artificial intelligent techniques can reduce the workload of clinicians and improve the diagnosis accuracy. A Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) of infarcted and normal ultrasound images will be useful for clinicians. In this study, the performance of CAD approach using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), second order statistics calculated from Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Higher-Order Spectra (HOS) texture descriptors are compared. The proposed system is validated using 400 MI and 400 normal ultrasound images, obtained from 80 patients with MI and 80 normal subjects. The extracted features are ranked based on t-value and fed to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to obtain the best performance using minimum number of features. The features extracted from DWT coefficients obtained an accuracy of 99.5%, sensitivity of 99.75% and specificity of 99.25%; GLCM have achieved an accuracy of 85.75%, sensitivity of 90.25% and specificity of 81.25%; and HOS obtained an accuracy of 93.0%, sensitivity of 94.75% and specificity of 91.25%. Among the three techniques presented DWT yielded the highest classification accuracy. Thus, the proposed CAD approach may be used as a complementary tool to assist cardiologists in making a more accurate diagnosis for the presence of MI. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","DWT; GLCM; HOS; Myocardial Infarction; Texture; Ultrasound image","Guidelines for the management of patients with acute myocardial infarction: executive summary: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Association Task Force on practice guidelines 9Committee on management of acute myocardial infarction) (1996) Circulation, 94, pp. 2341-2350; Acharya, U.R., Faust, O., Vinithasree, S., Alvin, A.P.C., Krishnamurthy, G., Seabra, J.C.R., Sanches, J., Suri, J.S., Understanding symptomatology of atherosclerotic plaque by image-based tissue characterisation (2013) Comput.

These problems are the main cause behind a mine closure and directly influencing the productivity of the underground stope mining and the profitability of the entire operation. Despite being aware of the significance of unplanned dilution and ore-loss, prediction of these phenomena is still unexplained as they occur through complex mechanisms and causative factors. Current management practices primarily rely on similar stope reconciliation data and the intuition of expert mining engineers. In this study, an innovative unplanned dilution and ore-loss (uneven break: UB) management system is established using a neuro-fuzzy system. The aim of the proposed decision support system is to overcome the UB phenomenon in underground stope blasting which provides quantitative prediction of unplanned dilution and ore-loss with practical recommendations simultaneously. To achieve the method proposed, an uneven break (UB) prediction system was developed by an artificial neural network (ANN) considering 1076 datasets covering 10 major UB causative factors collected from three underground stoping mines in Western Australia. In succession, the UB consultation system was established via a fuzzy expert system (FES) in reference to surveyed results of fifteen underground-mining experts. The UB prediction and consultation system were combined as one concurrent neuro-fuzzy system that is named the 'uneven break optimiser'. Because the current UB prediction systems in investigated mines were highly unsatisfactory with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.088 and limited to only unplanned dilution, the performance of the proposed UB prediction system (R of 0.719) is a remarkable achievement. The uneven break optimiser can be directly employed to improve underground stoping production, and this tool will be beneficial not only for underground stope planning and design but also for production management. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This application is of great use to researchers in the financial domain who study the impact of news (media) on the stock markets. We investigate the viability of a new fine-grained sentiment annotation scheme. Most of the current approaches to sentiment analysis focus on the detection of explicit sentiment. As news text often contains implicit sentiment, i.e. factual information implying positive or negative sentiment, our approach aims to identify both explicit and implicit sentiment. Furthermore, this sentiment is analyzed on a fine-grained level by detecting the topic of the sentiment, as sentiment is not always expressed towards the topics one is interested in. In order to test our approach, we assembled a corpus of company-specific news articles, which was manually labeled by four annotators to create a gold standard. We compare the results of our method to the performance of two coarse-grained baseline systems: a lexicon-based approach and a supervised machine learning approach that makes use of lexical features. Our fine-grained approach outperforms both baselines, and its output shows substantial to almost perfect agreement with the gold standard sentiment labels. Using our annotation scheme, we are able to filter out irrelevant sentiment expressions and detect explicit and implicit sentiment in a reliable way. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, for remote sensing applications, the conventional methods do not consider the spatial coherence between the training samples, which will lead to the unnecessary cost. Based on the above two points, this paper proposes a spatial coherence-based batch-mode AL method. First, mean shift clustering is used for the diversity criterion, and thus the number of new queries can be varied in the different iterations. Second, the spatial coherence is represented by a two-level segmentation map which is used to automatically label part of the new queries. To get a stable and correct second-level segmentation map, a new merging strategy is proposed for the mean shift segmentation. The experimental results with two real remote sensing image data sets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, compared with the other state-of-the-art methods. © 2015 IEEE.","active learning; hyperspectral images; image classification","Yamazaki, T., Gingras, D., Image classification using spectral and spatial information based on MRF models (1995) IEEE Trans.

The infants were suffering from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and were treated by the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy. The predictions of the CDSS are found to be in general agreement with clinical measurements. The CDSS is also used to determine the effect of low level oxygen treatment on arterial oxygen pressure if the infant[U+05F3]s oxygenation is low despite CPAP therapy. Based on the computational results, application of low levels of supplemental inspired fraction of oxygen (. FIO2) would result in significant improvement in oxygenation of premature infants provided such treatment is carefully controlled to avoid hyperoxemia. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Computerized decision-support systems; Continuous Positive Airway Pressure; Oxygen; Premature infants; Respiratory distress syndrome","Ramanathan, R., Bhatia, J.J., Sekar, K., Ernst, F.R., Mortality in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome treated with poractant alfa, calfactant or beractant: a retrospective study (2013) J.

Statistical methods have been extensively applied in the forecasting community for the past decades. Recently, machine learning techniques have drawn attention and useful forecasting systems based on these techniques have been developed. In this paper, we propose an approach based on neuro-fuzzy modeling for time series prediction. Given a predicting sequence, the local context of the sequence is located in the series of the observed data. Proper lags of relevant variables are selected and training patterns are extracted. Based on the extracted training patterns, a set of TSK fuzzy rules are constructed and the parameters involved in the rules are refined by a hybrid learning algorithm. The refined fuzzy rules are then used for prediction. Our approach has several advantages. It can produce adaptive forecasting models. It works for univariate and multivariate prediction. It also works for one-step as well as multi-step prediction. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

More and more often real-life tasks could generate massive and continuous amounts of data. Standard classifiers cannot cope with a large volume of the training set and/or changing nature of the environment. In this paper, we deal with a problem of continuously arriving objects, that with each time interval may contribute new, useful knowledge to the patter classification system. One-class classification is a very useful tool for stream analysis, as it can be used for tackling outliers, noise, appearance of new classes or imbalanced data to name a few. We propose a novel version of incremental One-Class Support Vector Machine, that assigns weights to each object according to its level of significance. This allows to train more robust one-class classifiers on incremental streams. We present two schemes for estimating weights for new, incoming data and examine their usefulness on a number of benchmark datasets. We also analyze time and memory requirements of our method. Results of experimental investigations prove, that our method can achieve better one-class recognition quality than algorithms used so far. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Data stream classification; Incremental learning; Machine learning; One-class classification; Pattern classification","Bicego, M., Figueiredo, M.A.T., Soft clustering using weighted one-class support vector machines (2009) Pattern Recognit., 42 (1), pp. 27-32; Cyganek, B., One-class support vector ensembles for image segmentation and classification (2012) J.

In machine learning, one effective feature selection approach is the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) form of regularization, which is equivalent to assuming a Laplacian prior distribution on the parameters. We review how such Bayesian priors can be implemented in gradient descent as a form of weight decay, which is a biologically plausible mechanism for Bayesian feature selection. In particular, we describe a new prior that offsets or ""raises"" the Laplacian prior distribution. We evaluate this alongside the Gaussian and Cauchy priors in gradient descent using a generic regression task where there are few relevant and many irrelevant features. We find that raising the Laplacian leads to less prediction error because it is a better model of the underlying distribution. We also consider two biologically relevant online learning tasks, one synthetic and one modeled after the perceptual expertise task of Krigolson et al. (2009). Here, raising the Laplacian prior avoids the fast erosion of relevant parameters over the period following training because it only allows small weights to decay. This better matches the limited loss of association seen between days in the human data of the perceptual expertise task. Raising the Laplacian prior thus results in a biologically plausible form of Bayesian feature selection that is effective in biologically relevant contexts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bayesian prior; Feature selection;

The woody component can be characterised by various quantifiable woody structural parameters, such as tree cover, tree height, above ground biomass (AGB) or canopy volume, each been useful for different purposes. In contrast to the limited spatial coverage of ground-based approaches, remote sensing has the ability to sense the high spatio-temporal variability of e.g. woody canopy height, cover and biomass, as well as species diversity and phenological status - a defining but challenging set of characteristics typical of African savannahs. Active remote sensing systems (e.g. Light Detection and Ranging - LiDAR; Synthetic Aperture Radar - SAR), on the other hand, may be more effective in quantifying the savannah woody component because of their ability to sense within-canopy properties of the vegetation and its insensitivity to atmosphere and clouds and shadows. Additionally, the various components of a particular target's structure can be sensed differently with SAR depending on the frequency or wavelength of the sensor being utilised. This study sought to test and compare the accuracy of modelling, in a Random Forest machine learning environment, woody above ground biomass (AGB), canopy cover (CC) and total canopy volume (TCV) in South African savannahs using a combination of X-band (TerraSAR-X), C-band (RADARSAT-2) and L-band (ALOS PALSAR) radar datasets. Training and validation data were derived from airborne LiDAR data to evaluate the SAR modelling accuracies. It was concluded that the L-band SAR frequency was more effective in the modelling of the CC (coefficient of determination or R2 of 0.77), TCV (R2 of 0.79) and AGB (R2 of 0.78) metrics in Southern African savannahs than the shorter wavelengths (X- and C-band) both as individual and combined (X+C-band) datasets. The addition of the shortest wavelengths also did not assist in the overall reduction of prediction error across different vegetation conditions (e.g. dense forested conditions, the dense shrubby layer and sparsely vegetated conditions). Although the integration of all three frequencies (X+C+L-band) yielded the best overall results for all three metrics (R2=0.83 for CC and AGB and R2=0.85 for TCV), the improvements were noticeable but marginal in comparison to the L-band alone. The results, thus, do not warrant the acquisition of all three SAR frequency datasets for tree structure monitoring in this environment. © 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

No 129/2, Istanbul, Turkey","Vocal fold disorders such as laryngitis, vocal nodules, and vocal polyps may cause hoarseness, breathing and swallowing difficulties due to vocal fold malfunction. Despite the fact that state of the art medical imaging techniques help physicians to obtain more detailed information, difficulty in differentiating minor anomalies of vocal folds encourages physicians to research new strategies and technologies to aid the diagnostic process. Recent studies on vocal fold disorders note the potential role of the vascular structure of vocal folds in differential diagnosis of anomalies. However, standards of clinical usage of the blood vessels have not been well established yet due to the lack of objective and comprehensive evaluation of the vascular structure.In this paper, we present a novel approach that categorizes vocal folds into healthy, nodule, polyp, sulcus vocalis, and laryngitis classes exploiting visible blood vessels on the superior surface of vocal folds and shapes of vocal fold edges by using image processing techniques and machine learning methods. We first detected the vocal folds on videolaryngostroboscopy images by using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptors. Then we examined the shape of vocal fold edges in order to provide features such as size and splay portion of mass lesions. We developed a new vessel centerline extraction procedure that is specialized to the vascular structure of vocal folds. Extracted vessel centerlines were evaluated in order to get vascular features of vocal folds, such as the amount of vessels in the longitudinal and transverse form. During the last step, categorization of vocal folds was performed by a novel binary decision tree architecture, which evaluates features of the vocal fold edge shape and vascular structure.The performance of the proposed system was evaluated by using laryngeal images of 70 patients. Sensitivity of 86%, 94%, 80%, 73%, and 76% were obtained for healthy, polyp, nodule, laryngitis, and sulcus vocalis classes, respectively. These results indicate that visible vessels of vocal folds can act as a prognostic marker for vocal fold pathologies, as well as the vocal fold shape features, and may play a critical role in more effective diagnosis. © 2015.","Classification of vocal fold disorders; Histogram of oriented gradients; Laryngeal image analysis; Measurement of vocal fold shape defects; Vascular vectors; Vessel centerline extraction","De Biase, N.G., Pontes, P.A., Blood vessels of vocal folds: a videolaryngoscopic study (2008) Arch.

Many important functions of cell are carried out through the proteins therein. Proteins rarely function alone. Most of their functions essential to life are associated with various types of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Therefore, knowledge of PPIs is fundamental for both basic research and drug development. With the avalanche of proteins sequences generated in the postgenomic age, it is highly desired to develop computational methods for timely acquiring this kind of knowledge. Here, a new predictor, called ""iPPI-Emsl"", is developed. In the predictor, a protein sample is formulated by incorporating the following two types of information into the general form of PseAAC (pseudo amino acid composition): (1) the physicochemical properties derived from the constituent amino acids of a protein; and (2) the wavelet transforms derived from the numerical series along a protein chain. The operation engine to run the predictor is an ensemble classifier formed by fusing seven individual random forest engines via a voting system. It is demonstrated with the benchmark dataset from Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as the dataset from Helicobacter pylori that the new predictor achieves remarkably higher success rates than any of the existing predictors in this area. The new predictor[U+05F3] web-server has been established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iPPI-Esml. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, we have further provided a step-by-step guide, by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to follow the complicated mathematics involved during its development. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Ensemble classifier; Fusion; Physicochemical properties; Pseudo amino acid composition; Random forests; Voting system; Wavelets transforms","Althaus, I.W., Gonzales, A.J., Chou, J.J., Diebel, M.R., Romero, D.L., Aristoff, P.A., Tarpley, W.G., Reusser, F., The quinoline U-78036 is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (1993) J.

Based on this result, we provide a connectivity measure depending on minor surface search between sample pairs. Accordingly, we build a connectivity graph among data samples. The use of graph construction is particularly demonstrated for clustering, but applications in other machine learning areas are possible. On Gaussian mixture and kernel density estimate type probability density models, we illustrate the theoretical results with examples and demonstrate that cluster boundaries between sample pairs can be detected using a line integral. We also demonstrate an example where the data distribution has a continuous line segment as its set of local maxima (not strict), for which mean-shift like gradient flow and other mode-seeking algorithms fail to identify a single cluster, while the proposed approach successfully determines this fact. © 2014 IEEE.","Clustering; Kernel density estimation; Minor surfaces; Mode-seeking","Xu, R., Wunsch, D., Survey of clustering algorithms (2005) IEEE Trans.

Here, we propose an integrated dynamical motion model (IDM), which is sufficiently general to handle diverse moving stimuli, yet sufficiently precise to account for a wide-ranging set of empirical observations made on a family of random dot kinematograms. In particular, we constructed models of the cortical areas involved in motion detection, motion integration and perceptual decision. We analyzed their parameters through dynamical simulations and numerical continuation to constrain their proper ranges. Then, empirical data from a family of random dot kinematograms experiments with systematically varying direction distribution, presentation duration and stimulus size, were used to evaluate our model and estimate corresponding model parameters. The resulting model provides an excellent account of a demanding set of parametrically varied behavioral effects on motion perception, providing both quantitative and qualitative elements of evaluation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Random dot kinematograms;

First, we analyze quad-tree CU depth decision process in HEVC and model it as a three-level of hierarchical binary decision problem. Second, a flexible CU depth decision structure is presented, which allows the performances of each CU depth decision be smoothly transferred between the coding complexity and RD performance. Then, a three-output joint classifier consists of multiple binary classifiers with different parameters is designed to control the risk of false prediction. Finally, a sophisticated RD-complexity model is derived to determine the optimal parameters for the joint classifier, which is capable of minimizing the complexity in each CU depth at given RD degradation constraints. Comparative experiments over various sequences show that the proposed CU depth decision algorithm can reduce the computational complexity from 28.82% to 70.93%, and 51.45% on average when compared with the original HEVC test model. The Bjontegaard delta peak signal-to-noise ratio and Bjontegaard delta bit rate are -0.061 dB and 1.98% on average, which is negligible. The overall performance of the proposed algorithm outperforms those of the state-of-the-art schemes. © 1992-2012 IEEE.","Coding Unit; High Efficiency Video Coding; Machine Learning; Support Vector Machine","Sullivan, G.J., Ohm, J., Han, W.-J., Wiegand, T., Overview of the high efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard (2012) IEEE Trans.

This study introduces new ensemble margin criteria to evaluate the performance of Random Forests (RF) in the context of large area land cover classification and examines the effect of different training data characteristics (imbalance and mislabelling) on classification accuracy and uncertainty. The study presents a new margin weighted confusion matrix, which used in combination with the traditional confusion matrix, provides confidence estimates associated with correctly and misclassified instances in the RF classification model. Landsat TM satellite imagery, topographic and climate ancillary data are used to build binary (forest/non-forest) and multiclass (forest canopy cover classes) classification models, trained using sample aerial photograph maps, across Victoria, Australia. Experiments were undertaken to reveal insights into the behaviour of RF over large and complex data, in which training data are not evenly distributed among classes (imbalance) and contain systematically mislabelled instances. Results of experiments reveal that while the error rate of the RF classifier is relatively insensitive to mislabelled training data (in the multiclass experiment, overall 78.3% Kappa with no mislabelled instances to 70.1% with 25% mislabelling in each class), the level of associated confidence falls at a faster rate than overall accuracy with increasing amounts of mislabelled training data. In general, balanced training data resulted in the lowest overall error rates for classification experiments (82.3% and 78.3% for the binary and multiclass experiments respectively). However, results of the study demonstrate that imbalance can be introduced to improve error rates of more difficult classes, without adversely affecting overall classification accuracy. © 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

However, current water quality modeling studies often neglect the agronomic concept of a cropping system and interactions with soils. This paper presents a participatory assessment framework involving local experts in building a shared diagnosis of nitrate losses from cropping systems in a WPA. It includes a co-designed typology of landscape units and participatory assessment of nitrate losses with the modeling software Syst'N. Results show that characteristics of cropping systems depended on soils and that nitrate losses were highest in shallow soils. Intercrop periods were identified as critical periods for nitrate leaching, which demonstrates the importance of considering pluri-annual crop rotations rather than individual crops. The framework is generic for a modeling approach based on the involvement of local experts, who define their functional system in an agronomically sound way. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cropping system; Decision support system; Landscape agronomy; Nitrate leaching; Participatory processes; Water protection area","Amossé, C., Jeuffroy, M.H., Mary, B., David, C., Contribution of relay intercropping with legume cover crops on nitrogen dynamics in organic grain systems (2014) Nutr.

This variant is a planning model that is a standard practice in business nowadays. Companies are contracting their deliveries to other companies that hire vehicles, and payment is made based on the distance covered by the vehicles. Available information on parameters in real world situations is also imprecise, and must be included in the optimization model and method. The aims of this paper are to formulate a model of this novel variant with time windows and imprecise constraints and to propose a fuzzy optimization approach and a hybrid metaheuristic for its solutions. The full proposal is applied to a real route planning problem with outsourcing, obtaining promising practical results. Customer demands and travel times are imprecise, thus capacity and time windows constraints are considered flexible and modelled as fuzzy constraints. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This can be provided by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) which are a low-cost means of collecting updated information about rivers. Another valuable resource is Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) which is a comparatively new means of improving the coverage of monitored areas because it is able to supply supplementary information to the WSN and thus support decision-making in flood risk management. However, there still remains the problem of how to combine WSN data with VGI. In this paper, an attempt is made to investigate AGORA-DS, which is a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) that is able to make flood risk management more effective by combining these data sources, i.e. WSN with VGI. This approach is built over a conceptual model that complies with the interoperable standards laid down by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) - e.g. Sensor Observation Service (SOS) and Web Feature Service (WFS) - and seeks to combine and present unified information in a web-based decision support tool. This work was deployed in a real scenario of flood risk management in the town of São Carlos in Brazil. The evidence obtained from this deployment confirmed that interoperable standards can support the integration of data from distinct data sources. In addition, they also show that VGI is able to provide information about areas of the river basin which lack data since there is no appropriate station in the area. Hence it provides a valuable support for the WSN data. It can thus be concluded that AGORA-DS is able to combine information provided by WSN and VGI, and provide useful information for supporting flood risk management. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Application case; Flood risk management; Interoperability standards; Spatial decision support system; Volunteered geographic information; Wireless sensor network","Ahmad, S., Simonovic, S.P., An intelligent decision support system for management of floods (2006) Water Resour.

To increase the use of bicycles, it is fundamental to provide bicycle-friendly environments. The scientific assessment of a bicyclist's perception of roadway environment, safety and comfort is of great interest. This study developed a methodology for categorizing bicycling environments defined by the bicyclist's perceived level of safety and comfort. Second-by-second bicycle speed data were collected using global positioning systems (GPS) on public bicycles. A set of features representing the level of bicycling environments was extracted from the GPS-based bicycle speed and acceleration data. These data were used as inputs for the proposed categorization algorithm. A support vector machine (SVM), which is a well-known heuristic classifier, was adopted in this study. A promising rate of 81.6% for correct classification demonstrated the technical feasibility of the proposed algorithm. In addition, a framework for bicycle traffic monitoring based on data and outcomes derived from this study was discussed, which is a novel feature for traffic surveillance and monitoring. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bicycle speed data; Bicycle traffic monitoring; Bicycling environments; Public bicycle; Support vector machine","Allen, D.P., Rouphail, N., Hummer, J.E., Milazzo, J.S., Operational analysis of uninterrupted bicycle facilities (1998) Transp.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, capable of prediction and diagnosis in non-linear and complex systems, are used to obtain the relationship of composition and processing parameters with said mechanical properties. Then the models are used as objective functions for the multi-objective genetic algorithms for evolving the tradeoffs between the conflicting objectives of achieving improved strength, ductility and impact toughness.

The ground response mechanism induced by shields is difficult to explain, since it engages both reliable ground deformation measurements in the field, along with relative operation parameters records of the mechanized shield. Existing empirical and analytical relations that are used for the calculation of ground settlement do not take into account the operation parameters of the shield performing the excavation. Even numerical analyses consider generally only ground characteristics and no more than simple geometrical data are required for the simulation of the shield. It is the objective here to include the operation parameters records in the interpretation of surface settlements due to Earth Pressure Balance Shield (EPBS) tunnelling. Use is made of data on ground movement deformation and EPBS operations that have been collected for Metro Projects of Athens and Thessaloniki. Such data are the ground settlements, ground qualities and EPBS operation parameters measured at the single and twin tunnels of these Metro projects. The transverse settlement troughs are drawn and their shape discussed. The ground conditions are similar over long tunnel stretches, which allows one to establish relationships between ground characteristics and EPBS operations to surface deformations. A comprehensive tunnelling data acquisition system was developed to collect information from in situ data on a ring-by-ring basis, such as geological conditions, shield operation parameters, tunnel geometry. Having utilized the aforementioned information and correlated the operation parameters to the maximum influence on ground movements, an artificial intelligence system, based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), is employed to develop predictive relations. In order to minimize the risk of ground movement, the tunnelling engineer and the EPBS pilot need to be able to make reliable prediction of settlements based on the operational data. Such an ANN algorithm has the ability to map input to output patterns i.e. all influencing parameters are related to surface settlements. It serves as a means to understand and predict ground movement behaviour induced by EPBS shield tunnelling, and deals as an indicator for construction control and for the implementation of remedial measures where needed. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Artificial neural network; Database management; Ground settlements; Machine operations; Mechanized tunnelling","Settlements Induced by Tunnelling (1995) Recommendation; Anagnostou, G., Eberhardsteiner, J., The one step solution of the advanced tunnel heading problem (2007) ECCOMAS thematic conference on computational methods in tunnelling (EURO:TUN, p. 2007. , Vienna, Austria; Anagnostou, G., The effect of tunnel advance rate on the surface settlements (2008) In: 12th international conference of IACMAG, , Goa, India; Ata, A.A., Ozdemir, I.L., Ground settlements induced by slurry shield tunnelling in stratified soils (1996) Proceedings of the North American Tunnelling’96, 1, pp. 43-50; Attewell, P.B., Taylor, R.K., (1984) Ground movements and their effects on structures, , Surrey University Press, Chapman and Hall, USA; Attewell, P.B., Woodman, J.P., Predicting the dynamics of ground settlement and its derivatives caused by tunnelling in soil (1982) Ground Eng 15(8), 36, pp. 13-22; Attiko Metro (2011) Technical documentationBiot, M.A., General theory of three-dimensional consolidation (1941) J Appl Phys, 12 (2), pp. 155-164; (2004) Tunnel lining design guide, , Thomas Telford Publishing, London; Burland, J.B., Assessment methods used in design.

The yield of steel determines how much percentage of hot metal, scrap, and iron ore are being converted into steel ingots. It represents the operational efficiency of the steelmaking shop and is considered as an important performance measure for producing a specific quantity of steel. Due to complexity of the steelmaking process and nonlinear relationship between the process parameters, modeling the input-output process parameters and accurately predicting the output yield in the steelmaking shop is very difficult and has been a major research issue. Statistical models and artificial neural networks (ANN) have been extensively studied by researchers and practitioners to model a variety of complex processes. In the present study, we consider random forests (RF), ANN, dynamic evolving neuro-fuzzy inference system (DENFIS) and support vector regression (SVR) as competitive learning tools to verify the suitability of applications of these approaches and investigate their comparative predictive ability. In the present investigation, 0.00001 of MSE is set as a goal of learning during modeling. Based on real-life data, the computational results depict that the training and testing MSE values of SVR and DENFIS are close to 0.00001 indicating that they have higher prediction ability than ANN and RF. Also, mean absolute percentage prediction errors of the proposed models confirm that the predicted yield based on each method is in good agreement with the testing datasets. Overall, SVR performs best and DENFIS the next best followed by ANN and RF methods respectively. The results suggest that the prediction precision given by SVR can meet the requirement for the actual production of steel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","5-Fold cross validation; Artificial neural networks; Dynamic evolving neural-fuzzy inference system; Modeling; Prediction; Random forests; Steelmaking process; Support vector regression","Aich, U., Banerjee, S., Modeling of EDM responses by support vector machine regression with parameters selected by particle swarm optimization (2014) Applied Mathematical Modelling, 38, pp. 2800-2818; Azadeh, A., Saberi, M., Gitiforouz, A., Saberi, Z., A hybrid simulation-adaptive network based fuzzy inference system for improvement of electricity consumption estimation (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36, pp. 11808-11817; Basak, D., Pal, S., Patranabis, D.C., Support vector regression (2007) Neural Information Processing Letters and Reviews, 11 (10), pp. 203-224; Bezerra, E.M., Ancelotti, A.C., Pardini, L.C., Rocco, J.A.F.F., Iha, K., Ribeiro, C.H.C., Artificial neural networks applied to epoxy composites reinforced with carbon and E-glass fibers: Analysis of the shear mechanical properties (2007) Materials Science and Engineering A, 464, pp. 177-185; Biau, G., Analysis of a random forests model (2012) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 13, pp. 1063-1095; Breiman, L., Bagging predictors (1996) Machine Learning, 24, pp. 123-140; Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Machine Learning, 45 (1), pp. 5-32; Breiman, L., Friedman, J.H., Olshen, R.A., Stone, C.J., (1984) Classification and Regression Trees, , Wadsworth & Brooks/Cole Advanced Books and software Monterey, CA; Caydas, U., Hascalik, A., Ekici, S., An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model for wire-EDM (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36, pp. 6135-6139; Chang, C.-C., Lin, C.-J., LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines (2011) ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2, pp. 1-27; Chapelle, O., Vapnik, V., Bousquet, O., Mukherjee, S., Choosing multiple parameters for support vectors machines (2002) Machine Learning, 46, pp. 131-159; Cooper, J.S., Kiiveri, H., Chow, E., Hubble, L.J., Webster, M.S., Muller, K.-H., Quantifying mixtures of hydrocarbons dissolved in water with a partially selective array random forests analysis (2014) Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, B, 202, pp. 279-285; Cortes, C., Vapnik, V., Support-vector networks (1995) Machine Learning, 20 (3), pp. 273-297; Erzurumlu, T., Oktem, H., Comparison of response surface model with neural network in determining the surface quality of moulded parts (2007) Materials and Design, 28 (2), pp. 459-465; Falkus, J., Pietrzkiewicz, P., Pietrzyk, W., Kusiak, J., Artificial neural network predictive system for oxygen steelmaking converter (2003) Neural Networks and Soft Computing, pp. 825-830. , Springer-Verlag; Genuer, R., Poggi, J.-M., Tuleau-Malot, C., (2008) Random Forests: Some Methodological Insights, , arXiv: 0811.3619; Gresovnik, I., Kodelja, T., Vertnik, R., Sarler, B., Application of artificial neural networks to improve steel production process (2012) Proceedings of the IASTED International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing, pp. 249-255; Hagan, M.T., Menhaj, M.B., Training feed forward networks with the Marquardt algorithm (1994) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 5, pp. 989-993; Han, M., Liu, C., Endpoint prediction model for basic oxygen furnace steel-making based on membrane algorithm evolving extreme learning machine (2014) Applied Soft Computing, 19, pp. 430-437; Haykin, S., (2009) Neural Networks and Learning Machines, , Pearson Education Inc; Jaiantilal, A., (2009) Classification and Regression by Randomforest-matlab, , http://www.code.google.com/p/randomforest-matlab, [Online].

Early detection and effective treatment is the only rescue to reduce breast cancer mortality. Accurate classification of a breast cancer tumor is an important task in medical diagnosis. Machine learning techniques are gaining importance in medical diagnosis because of their classification capability. In this paper, we propose a new, Genetically Optimized Neural Network (GONN) algorithm, for solving classification problems. We evolve a neural network genetically to optimize its architecture (structure and weight) for classification. We introduce new crossover and mutation operators which differ from standard crossover and mutation operators to reduce the destructive nature of these operators. We use the GONN algorithm to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant. To demonstrate our results, we had taken the WBCD database from UCI Machine Learning repository and compared the classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrix, ROC curves and AUC under ROC curves of GONN with classical model and classical back propagation model. Our algorithm gives classification accuracy of 98.24%, 99.63% and 100% for 50-50, 60-40, 70-30 training-testing partition respectively and 100% for 10 fold cross validation. The results show that our approach works well with the breast cancer database and can be a good alternative to the well-known machine learning methods. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Artificial Neural Network; Genetic Programming; Genetically Optimized Neural Network; Modified Crossover Operator","Abonyi, J., Szeifert, F., Supervised fuzzy clustering for the identification of fuzzy classifiers (2003) Pattern Recognition Letters, 24 (14), pp. 2195-2207; Albrecht, A.A., Lappas, G., Vinterbo, S.A., Wong, C., Ohno-Machado, L., Two applications of the lsa machine (2002) Neural Information Processing, 2002.

Box: 68511, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a well-known approach for Recommender Systems (RS). This approach extrapolates rating predictions from ratings given by user on items, which are represented by a user-item matrix filled with a rating ri,j given by an user i on an item j. Therefore, CF has been confined to this data structure relying mostly on adaptations of supervised learning methods to deal with rating predictions and matrix decomposition schemes to complete unfilled positions of the rating matrix. Although there have been proposals to apply Machine Learning (ML) to RS, these works had to transform the rating matrix into the typical Supervised Learning (SL) data set, i.e., a set of pairwise tuples (x,y), where y is the correspondent class (the rating) of the instance x∈Rk. So far, the proposed transformations were thoroughly crafted using the domain information. However, in many applications this kind of information can be incomplete, uncertain or stated in ways that are not machine-readable. Even when it is available, its usage can be very complex requiring specialists to craft the transformation. In this context, this work proposes a domain-independent transformation from the rating matrix representation to a supervised learning dataset that enables SL methods to be fully explored in RS. In addition, our transformation is said to be straightforward, in the sense that, it is an automatic process that any lay person can perform requiring no domain specialist. Our experiments have proven that our transformation, combined with SL methods, have greatly outperformed classical CF methods. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Collaborative filtering; Dimensionality reduction; Recommender system; Supervised learning","Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A., Toward the next generation of recommender systems: A survey of the state-of-the-art and possible extensions (2005) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 17, pp. 734-749; Billsus, D., Learning collaborative information filters (1998) International Conference on Machine Learning; Candès, E.J., Recht, B., Exact matrix completion via convex optimization (2009) Foundations of Computational Mathematics, 9, pp. 717-772; Caruana, R., Karampatziakis, N., An empirical evaluation of supervised learning in high dimensions (2008) On Machine Learning, pp. 96-103; Cunningham, P., Smyth, B., An assessment of machine learning techniques for review recommendation (2010) Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science, pp. 241-250; Gantner, Z., Rendle, S., Freudenthaler, C., Schmidt-Thieme, L., Mymedialite: A free recommender system library (2011) Proceedings of the Fifth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems RecSys '11, pp. 305-308. , ACM New York, NY, USA doi:; García-Cumbreras, M.A., Montejo-Ráez, A., Díaz-Galiano, M.C., Pessimists and optimists: Improving collaborative filtering through sentiment analysis (2013) Expert Systems with Applications, 40, pp. 6758-6765; Hsu, S., Wen, M., Lin, H., Lee, C., Aimed-a personalized tv recommendation system (2007) Interactive TV: A Shared Experience, pp. 166-174; Huang, G., Zhu, Q., Siew, C., Extreme learning machine: A new learning scheme of feedforward neural networks (2004) Neural Networks, 2, pp. 985-990; Huang, G.-B., Wang, D.H., Lan, Y., Extreme learning machines: A survey (2011) International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics, 2, pp. 107-122; Joshi, P., Incremental learning: Areas and methods - A survey (2012) International Journal of Data Mining & Knowledge Management Process, 2, pp. 43-51; Koren, Y., Factorization meets the neighborhood: A multifaceted collaborative filtering model (2008) Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining KDD '08, pp. 426-434. , ACM New York, NY, USA doi:; Koren, Y., Bell, R., Volinsky, C., Matrix factorization techniques for recommender systems (2009) Computer, 42, pp. 30-37; Linden, G., Smith, B., York, J., Amazon.

The set of selected requirements will be developed during the actual iteration. This selection problem can be reformulated as a search problem, allowing its treatment with metaheuristic optimization techniques. This paper studies how to apply Ant Colony Optimization algorithms to select requirements. First, we describe this problem formally extending an earlier version of the problem, and introduce a method based on Ant Colony System to find a variety of efficient solutions. The performance achieved by the Ant Colony System is compared with that of Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm, by means of computational experiments carried out on two instances of the problem constructed from data provided by the experts. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ant colony optimization; Next release problem; Search based software engineering; Software requirements","Albrecht, A.J., Gaffney, J.E., Software function, source lines of code, and development effort prediction: a software science validation (1983) IEEE Trans Softw Eng, 9 (6), pp. 639-648; Ali, S., Briand, L.C., Hemmati, H., Panesar-Walawege, R.K., A systematic review of the application and empirical investigation of search-based test case generation (2010) IEEE Trans Softw Eng, 36 (6), pp. 742-762; Arcuri, A., Fraser, G., Parameter tuning or default values?

Therefore, feature selection has become a necessary step to make the analysis more manageable and to extract useful knowledge about a given domain. A large variety of feature selection techniques are available in literature, and their comparative analysis is a very difficult task. So far, few studies have investigated, from a theoretical and/or experimental point of view, the degree of similarity/dissimilarity among the available techniques, namely the extent to which they tend to produce similar results within specific application contexts. This kind of similarity analysis is of crucial importance when two or more methods are combined in an ensemble fashion: indeed the ensemble paradigm is beneficial only if the involved methods are capable of giving different and complementary representations of the considered domain. This paper gives a contribution in this direction by proposing an empirical approach to evaluate the degree of consistency among the outputs of different selection algorithms in the context of high dimensional classification tasks. Leveraging on a proper similarity index, we systematically compared the feature subsets selected by eight popular selection methods, representatives of different selection approaches, and derived a similarity trend for feature subsets of increasing size. Through an extensive experimentation involving sixteen datasets from three challenging domains (Internet advertisements, text categorization and micro-array data classification), we obtained useful insight into the pattern of agreement of the considered methods. In particular, our results revealed how multivariate selection approaches systematically produce feature subsets that overlap to a small extent with those selected by the other methods. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Data mining; Feature selection; Knowledge discovery; Similarity measures","Abeel, T., Helleputte, T., Van De Peer, Y., Dupont, P., Saeys, Y., Robust biomarker identification for cancer diagnosis with ensemble feature selection methods (2010) Bioinformatics, 26 (3), pp. 392-398; Abusamra, H., A comparative study of feature selection and classification methods for gene expression data of glioma (2013) Procedia Computer Science, 23, pp. 5-14; Akerkar, R.A., Sajja, P.S., (2009) Knowledge-based Systems, , Jones & Bartlett Publishers Sudbury, MA, USA; Alon, U., Barkai, N., Notterman, D.A., Gish, K., Ybarra, S., Mack, D., Broad patterns of gene expression revealed by clustering analysis of tumor and normal colon tissues probed by oligonucleotide arrays (1999) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 96, pp. 6745-6750; Altidor, W., Khoshgoftaar, T.M., Van Hulse, J., Napolitano, A., Ensemble feature ranking methods for data intensive computing applications (2011) Handbook of Data Intensive Computing, pp. 349-376. , B.

Social lending has gained significant momentum recently, with some platforms reaching multi-billion dollar loan circulation in a short amount of time. On the other hand, sustainability and possible widespread adoption of such platforms depend heavily on reliable risk attribution to individual borrowers. For this purpose, we propose a random forest (RF) based classification method for predicting borrower status. Our results on data from the popular social lending platform Lending Club (LC) indicate the RF-based method outperforms the FICO credit scores as well as LC grades in identification of good borrowers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Machine learning; Peer-to-peer lending; Random forest; Risk assessment; Social lending","Aha, D., Kibler, D., Instance-based learning algorithms (1991) Machine Learning, 6, pp. 37-66; Amaral, L.A.N., Scala, A., Barthelemy, M., Stanley, H.E., Classes of small-world networks (2000) PNAS, 97, pp. 11149-11152; Backstrom, L., Huttenlocher, D., Kleinberg, J., Lan, X., Group formation in large social networks: Membership, growth, and evolution (2006) 12th ACM International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 44-54; Berger, S.C., Gleisner, F., Emergence of financial intermediaries in electronic markets: The case of online p2p lending (2009) Official Open Access Journal of VHB, 2, pp. 39-65; Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Machine Learning, 45, pp. 5-32; Chen, N., Ghosh, A., Lambert, N., Social lending (2009) 10th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce, pp. 335-344; Cortes, C., Vapnik, V., Support-vector networks (1995) Machine Learning, 20, pp. 273-297; Emekter, R., Tu, Y., Jirasakuldech, B., Lud, M., Evaluating credit risk and loan performance in online peer-to-peer (p2p) lending (2015) Applied Economics, 47, pp. 54-70; Gao, R., Feng, J., An overview study on P2P lending (2014) International Business and Management, 8, pp. 14-18; Han, L., Han, L., Zhao, H., Orthogonal support vector machine for credit scoring (2013) Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 26, pp. 848-862; Huang, C.L., Chen, M.C., Wang, C.J., Credit scoring with a data mining approach based on support vector machines (2007) Expert Systems with Applications, 33, pp. 847-856; James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., (2013) An Introduction to Statistical Learning, , Springer NY; Klafft, M., Online peer-to-peer lending: A lender's perspective (2008) International Conference on E-learning, pp. 371-375; Landwehr, N., Hall, M., Frank, E., Logistic model trees (2005) Machine Learning, 59, pp. 161-205; Lee, E., Lee, B., Herding behavior in online P2P lending: An empirical investigation (2012) Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 11, pp. 495-503; (2015) LendingClub.com, , http://www.lendingclub.com/public/about-us.action, Accessed January 27th; Lopez, S.H., Social interactions in p2p lending (2009) 3rd Workshop on Social Network Mining and Analysis, pp. 1-8; Rodgers, G.J., Zheng, D., A herding model with preferential attachment and fragmentation (2002) Physica A, pp. 375-380; Schebesch, K.B., Stecking, R., Support vector machines for classifying and describing credit applicants: Detecting typical and critical regions (2005) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 56, pp. 1082-1088; Schebesch, K.B., Stecking, R., Support vector machines for credit scoring: Extension to non standard cases (2005) Innovations in Classification, Data Science, and Information Systems, pp. 498-505. , D.

The literature has reported some decision support systems (DSSs) that are far from the state-of-the-art with regard to optimization models and methods, and several research works that do not address industrial issues. We contribute to reduce that gap by developing and describing a DSS that resulted from several iterations with a P&P company and from a thorough review of the literature on process systems engineering. The DSS incorporates relevant industrial features (which motivated the development of a specific model), exhibits important technical details (such as the connection to existing systems and user-friendly interfaces) and shows how optimization can be integrated in real world applications, enhanced by key pre- and post-optimization procedures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Continuous production; Decision support system; Lot-sizing and scheduling; MIP-based heuristics; Pulp and paper industry","Akkiraju, R., Keskinocak, P., Murthy, S., Wu, F., An agent-based approach for scheduling multiple machines (2001) Appl Intell, 14 (2), pp. 135-144; Almada-Lobo, B., Klabjan, D., Carravilla, M.A., Oliveira, J.F., Multiple machine continuous setup lot sizing with sequence-dependent setups (2010) Comput Optim Appl, 47 (3), pp. 529-552; Amorim, P., Antunes, C.H., Almada-Lobo, B., Multi-objective lot-sizing and scheduling dealing with perishability issues (2011) Ind Eng Chem Res, 50 (6), pp. 3371-3381; Amorim, P., Pinto-Varela, T., Almada-Lobo, B., Barbósa-Póvoa, A., Comparing models for lot-sizing and scheduling of single-stage continuous processes: operations research and process systems engineering approaches (2013) Comput Chem Eng, 52, pp. 177-192; Bongers, P.M., Bakker, B., Application of multi-stage scheduling (2006) Comput Aided Chem Eng, 21, pp. 1917-1922; Camargo, V., Toledo, F., Almada-Lobo, B., Three time-based scale formulations for the two-stage lot sizing and scheduling in process industries (2012) J Oper Res Soc, 63, pp. 1613-1630; Castro, P.M., Harjunkoski, I., Grossmann, I.E., New continuous-time scheduling formulation for continuous plants under variable electricity cost (2009) Ind Eng Chem Res, 48 (14), pp. 6701-6714; (2013) Key statistics - European pulp and paper industry 2012, Tech. rep.; Clark, A.R., Clark, S.J., Rolling-horizon lot-sizing when set-up times are sequence-dependent (2000) Int J Prod Res, 38 (10), pp. 2287-2307; Correia, M., Oliveira, J., Ferreira, J., Integrated resolution of assignment, sequencing and cutting problems in paper production planning (2012) Int J Prod Res, 50 (18), pp. 5195-5212; Dillenberger, C., Escudero, L.F., Wollensak, A., Zhang, W., On practical resource allocation for production planning and scheduling with period overlapping setups (1994) Eur J Oper Res, 75 (2), pp. 275-286; Dimitriadis, A., Shah, N., Pantelides, C., Rtn-based rolling horizon algorithms for medium term scheduling of multipurpose plants (1997) Comput Chem Eng, 21, pp. S1061-S1066; Drexl, A., Haase, K., Proportional lotsizing and scheduling (1995) Int J Prod Econ, 40 (1), pp. 73-87; Erdirik-Dogan, M., Grossmann, I.E., Simultaneous planning and scheduling of single-stage multi-product continuous plants with parallel lines (2008) Comput Chem Eng, 32 (11), pp. 2664-2683; Figueira, G., Oliveira Santos, M., Almada-Lobo, B., A hybrid vns approach for the short-term production planning and scheduling: a case study in the pulp and paper industry (2013) Comput Oper Res, 40 (7), pp. 1804-1818; Fleischmann, B., The discrete lot-sizing and scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup costs (1994) Eur J Oper Res, 75 (2), pp. 395-404; Fleischmann, B., Meyr, H., The general lotsizing and scheduling problem (1997) OR Spect, 19, pp. 11-21; Furlan, M., Almada-Lobo, B., Santos, M., Morabito, R., Unequal individual genetic algorithm with intelligent diversification for the lot-scheduling problem in integrated mills using multiple-paper machines (2015) Comput Oper Res, 59, pp. 33-50; Gold, N., Mohan, A., Knight, C., Munro, M., Understanding service-oriented software (2004) IEEE Softw, 21 (2), pp. 71-77; Guimar aes, L., Amorim, P., Sperandio, F., Moreira, F., Almada-Lobo, B., Annual distribution budget in the beverage industry: a case study (2014) Interfaces, 44 (6), pp. 605-626; Guimar aes, L., Klabjan, D., Almada-Lobo, B., Modeling lotsizing and scheduling problems with sequence dependent setups (2014) Eur J Oper Res, 239 (3), pp. 644-662; Harjunkoski, I., Maravelias, C., Bongers, P., Castro, P., Engell, S., Grossmann, I., Scope for industrial applications of production scheduling models and solution methods (2014) Comput Chem Eng, 62, pp. 161-193; Janak, S.L., Floudas, C.A., Kallrath, J., Vormbrock, N., Production scheduling of a large-scale industrial batch plant. i. short-term and medium-term scheduling (2006) Ind Eng Chem Res, 45 (25), pp. 8234-8252; Jankunaite, D., (2006) Pulp and paper industry - case study, SCA Forest Products AB, , http://www.balticuniv.uu.se/index.php; Karimi, I.A., McDonald, C.M., Planning and scheduling of parallel semicontinuous processes. 2.

Initially, the optimal sizing and tilt angle calculation were done for different cities of India, for low cost and zero load rejection with the available metrological data. Using the latitude, longitude and altitude of any remote location, the optimal size of a hybrid system is found through AIT. The tilt angle for the photovoltaic (PV) array to be installed in any remote location is also predicted to reduce the hourly usage of diesel generator (DG) for all the four seasons and the number of visits for manual tracking is optimized to three per year through this research. The predicted optimal values, using adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural network (ANN) are compared with the calculated values. The life cycle cost (LCC) of the optimized hybrid system is compared with the standalone PV as well as the DG system cost to prove its cost effectiveness.

Despite these significances of surface energy, they are difficult to obtain experimentally and the few available ones are subjected to certain degree of inaccuracies due to extrapolation of surface tension to 0 K. In order to cater for these difficulties, we have developed a model using computational intelligence technique on the platform of support vector regression (SVR) to establish a database of surface energies of hexagonal close packed metals (HCP). The SVR based-model was developed through training and testing SVR using fourteen experimental data of periodic metals. The developed model shows accuracy of 99.08% and 100% during training and testing phase, respectively, using test-set cross validation technique. The developed model was further used to obtain surface energies of HCP metals. The surface energies obtained from SVR-based model are closer to the experimental values than the results of the well-known existing theoretical models. The outstanding performance of this developed model in estimating surface energies of HCP metals with high degree of accuracy, in the presence of few experimental data, is a great achievement in the field of surface science because of its potential to circumvent experimental difficulties in determining surface energies of materials. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The vehicle-to-grid technology, for instance, literally turns electric vehicles into a mobile battery, enabling new areas of applications (e.g., to provide regulatory energy, to do grid-load balancing, or to buffer surpluses of energy) and business perspectives. Utilising a vehicle’s battery, however is not without a price—in this case: the driver’s mobility. Given this dependency, it is interesting that most available works consider the application of electric vehicles for energy and grid-related problems in isolation, that is, detached from mobility-related issues. The distributed artificial intelligence laboratory, or DAI-Lab, is a third-party funded research lab at Technische Universität Berlin and integrates the chair for agent technologies in business applications and telecommunication. The DAI-Lab has engaged in a large number of both, past and upcoming projects concerned with two aspects of managing electric vehicles, namely: energy and mobility. This article aims to summarise experiences that were collected during the last years and to present developed solutions which consider energy and mobility-related problems jointly. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Aabrandt, A., Andersen, P., Pedersen, A., You, S., Poulsen, B., O’Connell, N., Ostergaard, J., Prediction and optimization methods for electric vehicle charging schedules in the edison project.

The need for synthesizing realistic networks has resulted in development of various network models. In this paper, we address the problem of selecting and calibrating the model that best fits a given target network. The existing model fitting approaches mostly suffer from sensitivity to network perturbations, lack of the parameter estimation component, dependency on the size of the networks, and low accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we considered a broad range of network features and employed machine learning techniques such as genetic algorithms, distance metric learning, nearest neighbor classification, and artificial neural networks. Our proposed method, which is named ModelFit, outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines with respect to accuracy and noise tolerance in different network datasets. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of this study is to examine the performance of several interpolation techniques under typical atmospheric conditions. Several types of kriging and artificial neural networks used as spatial interpolators are here compared and evaluated against ordinary kriging, using real airborne CO<inf>2</inf> mixing-ratio data and synthetic data. The real data were measured (on December 26, 2012) between Billings and Lamont, near Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, within and above the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Predictions were made all along the flight trajectory within a total volume of 5000km3 of atmospheric air (27×33×5.6km). We evaluated (a) universal kriging, (b) ensemble neural networks, (c) universal kriging with ensemble neural network outputs used as covariates, and (d) ensemble neural networks with ordinary kriging of the residuals as interpolation tools. We found that in certain cases, when the weaknesses of ordinary kriging interpolation schemes (based on an omnidirectional isotropic variogram presumption) became apparent, more sophisticated interpolation methods were in order. In this study, preservation of the potentially nonlinear relationship between the trend and coordinates (by using neural kriging output as a covariate in a universal kriging scheme) was attempted, with varying degrees of success (it was best performer in 4 out of 8 cases). The study confirmed the necessity of selecting an interpolation approach that includes a combination of expert understanding and appropriate interpolation tools. The error analysis showed that uncertainty representations generated by the kriging methods are superior to neural networks, but that the actual error varies from case to case. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Airborne measurements; Ensemble; Neural networks; Universal kriging; Urban outflow","Ackerman, T.P., Genio, A.D.D., Ellingson, R.G., Ferrare, R.A., Klein, S.A., McFarquhar, G.M., Lamb, P.J., Verlinde, J., (2004) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program Science Plan: Current Status and Future Direcitons of the ARM Science Program, , US Department of Energy, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Washington, DC; Araújo, M.B., New, M., Ensemble forecasting of species distributions (2007) Trends Ecol.

Operation Research techniques applied in many situations, like heuristic algorithms, meta-heuristics, similarity measures, use of constraints, combinatorial algorithms and collaborative efforts provide valuable tools for this process, if augmented by other techniques known from knowledge management and information retrieval. Given the huge amount of information we are confronted with, information integration is one of the biggest challenges of this century. This paper describes methods and techniques for the information integration process. It is interesting to note that in areas such as information integration, consolidation and simplification that are not usually at the heart of Operation Research, some of the most important techniques used in this field can be applied successfully. Information integration is an important topic but, in general no really convincing approaches have been discovered, so far. By limiting the domain to the integration of image databases the problem becomes tractable, by using the mentioned techniques and also applying methods ranging from image processing, knowledge management and natural language processing to feature engineering. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Constraints observation; Feature engineering; Heuristic algorithms; Human supported artificial intelligence; Information integration; Natural language processing","Afzal, M.T., Balke, W.T., Kulathuramaiyer, N., Maurer, H., Rule based autonomous citation mining with TIERL (2010) JDIM, 8 (1), pp. 196-204; (2014) Austria-Forum, , http://Austria-forum.org/; Bikel, D.M., Schwartz, R., Weischedel, R.M., An algorithm that learns what’s in a name (1999) Mach Learn, 34 (1), pp. 211-231; Blazsik, Z., Imre, C., Kovcs, Z., Heuristic algorithms for a complex parallel machine scheduling problem (2008) CJOR, 16 (4), pp. 379-390; Carlson, A., Betteridge, J., Wang, R.C., Hruschka, E.R., Mitchell, T., Coupled semi-supervised learning for information extraction.

Therefore efficient management of the SFPH is essential. There are basically two ways to improve the SPFH performance: to reduce the travelling distance between fields and to design an efficient planning for the transport vehicles. A decision support tool has been developed for silage harvest operations to help farm managers, consultants, and technicians decide which resources they should use to minimise the cost of harvesting operations. The focus is on searching the routes that provide reduced travelling distances for the SPFH by prioritising the harvesting starting date for each farmer, and matching the SPFH and number of trucks to minimise the total cost of the maize silage harvesting cycle. The developed decision support system is compared to a real scenario in a maize harvesting season. Results show that by using the decision support tool, savings of over 15% can be obtained in distances travelled when compared with manual scheduling. Savings over 20% could be made if the restriction of using the starting harvesting dates requested by the farmers was relaxed. Under the conditions tested, if tolerance levels are not considered, the harvesting system is more sensitive to selecting correct transport management approach than to the efficient management of SPFH routes. © 2015 IAgrE.","Biomass logistics; Fleet management; Maize silage harvest","Amiama, C., Bueno, J., Álvarez, C.J., Pereira, J.M., Design and field test of an automatic data acquisition system in a self-propelled forage harvester (2008) Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 61 (2), pp. 192-200; Amiama, C., Bueno, J., Pereira, J.M., Prediction of effective field capacity in forage harvesting and diskharrowing operations (2010) Transactions of ASABE, 53 (6), pp. 1739-1745; Bentley, W., Wouldn't you like to have all of your land in one place-land fragmentation in northwest Portugal?

In this situation they have to take quick and precise decisions about how to cope with the situation. Moreover, there is not readily available technical information to support their decisions regarding the course of action they should follow to handle the agro-climatic risk. In this paper a computer model (soil water balance model) is described to assess the impact on crops yields of rainfall shortages in dry lands in Mexico. The model is linked to a knowledge based database where a farmer may find readily available information to support cropping decisions. The knowledge base activates when the computed average crop yield is less than the 50% of the expected crop yield. The knowledge base provides information on risk, potential crops, and the geographical location (counties) where the crop may succeed. Also, it provides a technology to increase water productivity under limited availability situations. Further, the model can evaluate the impact of a climate change scenario (IPCC B2). Other inputs to the model being equal, the user may shift the model to run the climate change scenario and to compare the outputs of the model to assess the climate change impact on future crops yields. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Knowledge base; Model; Risk; Water balance","Allen, R.G., Pereira, L.S., Raes, D., Smith, M., (1998), p. 300. , FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56 Crop Evapotranspiration (Guidelines for Computing Crop Water Requirements).

However, many real-world applications involve samples that are not described as feature vectors, but as (dis)similarity data. Converting vectorial data into (dis)similarity data is more easily performed than converting (dis)similarity data into vectorial data. This study proposes a stochastic iterative distance transformation model for similarity-based learning. The proposed model can be used to identify a clear class boundary in data by modifying the (dis)similarities between examples. The experimental results indicate that the performance of the proposed method is comparable with those of various vector-based and proximity-based learning algorithms. © 2015 IEEE.","Classifier design and evaluation; Data mining; Knowledge modeling; Machine learning","Alpaydin, E., (2004) Introduction to Machine Learning, pp. 85-86. , Cambridge, MA, USA: MIT Press; Altschul, S.F., Gish, W., Miller, W., Myers, E.W., Lipman, D.J., Basic local alignment search tool (1990) J.

Most of them rely on inference components heavily for detecting interesting activities or contexts. Existing work implements inference components using traditional models designed for balanced data sets, where the sizes of interesting (positive) and non-interesting (negative) data are comparable. Practically, however, the positive and negative sensing data are highly imbalanced. For example, a single daily activity such as bicycling or driving usually occupies a small portion of time, resulting in rare positive instances. Under this circumstance, the trained models based on imbalanced data tend to mislabel positive ones as negative. In this paper, we propose a new inference framework SLIM based on several machine learning techniques in order to accommodate the imbalanced nature of sensing data. Especially, guided under-sampling is employed to obtain balanced labelled subsets, followed by a similarity-based sampling that draws massive unlabelled data to enhance training. To the best of our knowledge, SLIM is the first model that considers data imbalance in mobile sensing. We prototype two sensing apps and the experimental results show that SLIM achieves higher recall (activity recognition rate) while maintaining the precision compared with five classical models. In terms of the overall recall and precision, SLIM is around 12 percent better than the compared solutions on average. © 2014 IEEE.","imbalanced sensing data; machine learning; Mobile sensing applications; semi-supervised learning; under-sampling","Campbell, A.T., Eisenman, S.B., Lane, N.D., Miluzzo, E., Peterson, R.A., Lu, H., Zheng, X., Ahn, G.-S., The rise of people-centric sensing (2008) IEEE Internet Comput., 12 (4), pp. 12-21. , Jul./Aug; Lane, N.D., Miluzzo, E., Lu, H., Peebles, D., Choudhury, T., Campbell, A.T., A survey of mobile phone sensing (2010) IEEE Commun.

The approach constructs a database that associates ambient radio signals with physical locations in training phase, and then estimates the location by finding the most similar signal pattern within the database. To achieve robust and accurate location estimation, the training phase should be conducted across the entire target space. In practice, however, a user may only access limited or authorized places in a building, that causes degradation in accuracy. In this paper, we present a smartphone-based autonomous indoor war-walking scheme, which automatically constructs the location fingerprint database, even covering unvisited locations. While a smartphone user explores the target area, the proposed system tracks the user's trajectory and simultaneously trains the location fingerprint database. Furthermore, our scheme interpolates radio signals in the database with an appropriate radio propagation model, and supplements fingerprints for unvisited places. As a result, although a user may sparsely explore the target site, the scheme returns the complete database. We implemented our solution and demonstrated the feasibility of the solution. © 2014 IEEE.","Data interpolation; indoor positioning system; localization; machine learning; war-walking","Honkavirta, V., Perala, T., Ali-Loytty, S., Piche, R., A comparative survey of WLAN location fingerprinting methods (2009) Proc.

A fundamental assumption for these approaches is that the documents in the collection are all about one topic. However, in reality users' interests can be diverse and the documents in the collection often involve multiple topics. Topic modelling, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), was proposed to generate statistical models to represent multiple topics in a collection of documents, and this has been widely utilized in the fields of machine learning and information retrieval, etc. But its effectiveness in information filtering has not been so well explored. Patterns are always thought to be more discriminative than single terms for describing documents. However, the enormous amount of discovered patterns hinder them from being effectively and efficiently used in real applications, therefore, selection of the most discriminative and representative patterns from the huge amount of discovered patterns becomes crucial. To deal with the above mentioned limitations and problems, in this paper, a novel information filtering model, Maximum matched Pattern-based Topic Model (MPBTM), is proposed. The main distinctive features of the proposed model include: (1) user information needs are generated in terms of multiple topics; (2) each topic is represented by patterns; (3) patterns are generated from topic models and are organized in terms of their statistical and taxonomic features; and (4) the most discriminative and representative patterns, called Maximum Matched Patterns, are proposed to estimate the document relevance to the user's information needs in order to filter out irrelevant documents. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model by using the TREC data collection Reuters Corpus Volume 1. The results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art term-based models and pattern-based models. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","information filtering; pattern mining; relevance ranking; Topic model; user interest model","Robertson, S., Zaragoza, H., Taylor, M., Simple BM25 extension to multiple weighted fields (2004) Proc. 13th ACM Int.

Feature selection is usually a critical preprocessing step for many machine-learning applications such as clustering and classification. In this paper, we focus on feature selection for supervised classification which targets at finding features that can best predict class labels. Traditional greedy search algorithms incrementally find features based on the relevance of candidate features and the class label. However, this may lead to suboptimal results when there are redundant features that may interfere with the selection. To solve this problem, we propose a subset selection algorithm that considers both the selected and remaining features' relevances with the label. The intuition is that features, which do not have better alternatives from the feature set, should be selected first. We formulate the selection problem as maximizing the dependency margin which is measured by the difference between the selected feature set performance and the remaining feature set performance. Extensive experiments on various data sets show the superiority of the proposed approach against traditional algorithms. © 2014 IEEE.","Conditionally independent; dependency margin; feature selection; forward greedy search; redundant feature","Liu, H., Evolving feature selection (2005) IEEE Intell.

These - and many others - represent perfect examples of the opportunities and difficulties presented by Big Data: the available information often arrives from a variety of sources and has diverse features so that learning from all the sources may be valuable but integrating what is learned is subject to the curse of dimensionality. This paper develops and analyzes algorithms that allow efficient learning and decision-making while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. We formalize the information available to the learner/decision-maker at a particular time as a context vector which the learner should consider when taking actions. In general the context vector is very high dimensional, but in many settings, the most relevant information is embedded into only a few relevant dimensions. If these relevant dimensions were known in advance, the problem would be simple - but they are not. Moreover, the relevant dimensions may be different for different actions. Our algorithm learns the relevant dimensions for each action, and makes decisions based in what it has learned. Formally, we build on the structure of a contextual multi-armed bandit by adding and exploiting a relevance relation. We prove a general regret bound for our algorithm whose time order depends only on the maximum number of relevant dimensions among all the actions, which in the special case where the relevance relation is single-valued (a function), reduces to Õ(T2(2√-1)); in the absence of a relevance relation, the best known contextual bandit algorithms achieve regret Õ(T(D+1)/(D+2)), where D is the full dimension of the context vector. Our algorithm alternates between exploring and exploiting and does not require observing outcomes during exploitation (so allows for active learning). Moreover, during exploitation, suboptimal actions are chosen with arbitrarily low probability. Our algorithm is tested on datasets arising from network security and online news article recommendations. © 2015 IEEE.","active learning; Contextual bandits; dimensionality reduction; learning relevance; online learning; recommender systems; regret","Tekin, C., Van Der-Schaar, M., Discovering, learning and exploiting relevance (2014) Proc.

We undertook a thorough validation of three versions of the hybrid-mechanistic wind risk model, ForestGALES, and a statistical logistic regression model, against observed damage in a Scottish upland conifer forest following a major storm. Statistical analysis demonstrated that increasing tree height and local wind speed during the storm were the main factors associated with increased damage levels. All models provided acceptable discrimination between damaged and undamaged forest stands but there were trade-offs between the accuracy of the mechanistic models and model bias. The two versions of the mechanistic model with the lowest bias gave very comparable overall results at the forest scale and could form part of a decision support system for managing forest wind damage risk. © 2015.","Decision support system; Forest disturbance; Mechanistic modelling; Risk modelling; Validation; Wind damage","Albrecht, A., Hanewinkel, M., Bauhus, J., Kohnle, U., How does silviculture affect storm damage in forests of south-west Germany?

They have very nice theoretical properties and have proven to be efficient in many real life applications but the design of SVM training algorithms often gives rise to challenging optimization issues. We propose here to review the basics of Support Vector Machine learning from a multi-agent optimization perspective. Multi-agents systems break down complex optimization problems into elementary ""oracle"" tasks and perform a collaborative solving process resulting in a self-organized solution of the complex problems. We show how the SVM training problem can also be ""tackled"" from this point of view and provide several perspectives for binary classification, hyperparameters selection, multiclass learning as well as unsupervised learning. This conceptual work is illustrated through simple examples in order to convey the ideas and understand the behavior of agent cooperation. The proposed models provide simple formulations of complex learning tasks that are sometimes very difficult to solve with classical optimization strategies. The ideas that are discussed open up perspectives for the design of new distributed cooperative learning systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper outlines the design and implementation of a prototype web-based spatial decision support system (SDSS), referred to as the Community Adaptation Viewer (CAV), to assist adaptation planning. Thin-client, Javascript enabled web-SDSS software was constructed to allow interaction with urban infrastructure, and support ""on-the-fly"" assessment of social and economic vulnerability. Facilitated, decision-making workshops were conducted with small groups of stakeholders to evaluate the effectiveness of the prototype. The test case illustrates that high levels of information integration are practical to achieve, and that the SDSS can significantly enhance the ability of communities to conduct elaborate, geographically-specific climate change adaptation planning. Given the long time frame required to fulfil some adaptation plans, it is crucial that communities begin to develop and invest in adaptation strategies as soon as possible. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptation; Climate change; Flood risk; Spatial decision support; Web-based software","Aggett, G., McColl, C., Evaluating decision support systems for PPGIS applications (2006) Cartogr.

To fulfill such a maximization aim, an optimal-distance-based transmission strategy is put forward on the basis of ant colony optimization (ACO). First, by introducing two notions, most energy-efficient distance and most energy-balanced distance, a local optimal-distance achievement mechanism is presented not only for a high energy efficiency, but also a good energy balancing in WSNs. Furthermore, by working out a network lifetime evaluation method, a global optimal-distance acquirement scheme is developed to achieve energy depletion minimization for sensor nodes with maximal energy consumption throughout the network. Finally, it is proved by simulations that our findings significantly outperform the state-of-the-art solutions. © 2014 IEEE.","good energy balancing; high energy efficiency; network lifetime evaluation; Wireless sensor networks","Pantazis, N.A., Nikolidakis, S.A., Vergados, D.D., Energy-efficient routing protocols in wireless sensor networks: A survey (2013) IEEE Commun.

Deposition and accumulation of scaling minerals may occur in oilfields due to the incompatibility existing between foreign fluids injected into the medium and indigenous formation water. Deposition of these minerals in porous media may lead to severe permeability loss, formation damage and hydrocarbon production decline. This paper describes a modeling study representing permeability reduction due to scale deposition by employing an approach based on Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Coupled Simulated Annealing (CSA), generally referred to as CSA-LSSVM. To this end, almost 1306 experimental data were assembled from the literature aiming to build a comprehensive and reliable model. Applicability of the CSA-LSSVM model was then evaluated in the range of data employed in this study and well accordance was observed between model predictions and experimental measurements yielding an overall correlation coefficient (R2) 0.999. At the end, permeability reduction data gathered from the literature were analyzed for outlier diagnosis using the leverage statistical algorithm along with providing full details of the implemented method. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","CSA; LSSVM; Permeability; Porous media; Scale deposition; Water flooding","Ahmed, S.J., (2004) Laboratory Study on Precipitation of Calcium Sulphate in Berea Sand Stone Cores, , King Fahd University Dhahran, SA; Allaga, D.A., Wu, G., Sharma, M.M., Lake, L.W., Barium and calcium sulfate precipitation and migration inside sandpacks (1992) SPE Form.

Boosting operates by learning multiple functions with subsequent functions focusing on incorrect instances where the previous functions predicted the wrong label. Despite considerable success, boosting still has difficulty on data sets with certain types of problematic training data (e.g., label noise) and when complex functions overfit the training data. We propose a novel cluster-based boosting (CBB) approach to address limitations in boosting for supervised learning systems. Our CBB approach partitions the training data into clusters containing highly similar member data and integrates these clusters directly into the boosting process. CBB boosts selectively (using a high learning rate, low learning rate, or not boosting) on each cluster based on both the additional structure provided by the cluster and previous function accuracy on the member data. Selective boosting allows CBB to improve predictive accuracy on problematic training data. In addition, boosting separately on clusters reduces function complexity to mitigate overfitting. We provide comprehensive experimental results on 20 UCI benchmark data sets with three different kinds of supervised learning systems. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CBB approach compared to a popular boosting algorithm, an algorithm that uses clusters to improve boosting, and two algorithms that use selective boosting without clustering. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Clustering Algorithms; Machine Learning","Reyzin, L., Schapire, R., How boosting the margin can also boost classifier complexity (2006) Proc.

We present the first phase of a system with the potential to attribute energy-related events to an individual occupant of a space and provide occupant-specific energy usage feedback in an uninstrumented space (e.g., home or office). This initial phase focuses on collecting the electromagnetic field (EMF) radiated by several common appliances to determine a unique signature for each appliance. It also implements a machine learning algorithm to classify appliances from an incoming EMF data file. The proposed approach has been prototyped with hardware realization. The results obtained on tested appliances indicate the EMF sensor's ability and potential to develop a system for providing occupant-specific energy feedback. © 2014 IEEE.","Decision Trees; EMF sensor; EMF signatures; Energy consumption","(2009) Use of Energy in the United States Explained, , Energy Inf.

We present a simple and effective method to generate a classifier of face images, by training a linear classification algorithm on a massive dataset entirely assembled and labelled by automated means. In doing so, we perform the largest experiment on face gender recognition so far published, reporting the highest performance yet. Four million images and more than 60,000 features are used to train online classifiers. By using an ensemble of linear classifiers, we achieve an accuracy of 96.86% on the most challenging public database, labelled faces in the wild (LFW), 2.05% higher than the previous best result on the same dataset (Shan, 2012). This result is relevant both for the machine learning community, addressing the role of large datasets, and the computer vision community, providing a way to make high quality face gender classifiers. Furthermore, we propose a general way to generate and exploit massive data without human annotation. Finally, we demonstrate a simple and effective adaptation of the Pegasos that makes it more robust. © 2015ElsevierB.V.Allrightsreserved 2015.","Big data; Gender classification; On-line learning","Shan, C., Learning local binary patterns for gender classification on real-world face images (2012) Pattern Recognit.

It uses electronic ink-tracing files without having any information about form structure. Given a form format, the ink-tracing files are used to build the BN by providing the possible relationships between corresponding fields using conditional probabilities, that goes from individual fields up to the complete model construction. To simplify the BN, we sub-divide a single form into three different areas: header, body and footer, and integrate them together, where we study three fundamental BN learning algorithms: Naive, Peter & Clark and maximum weighted spanning tree. Under this framework, we validate it with a real-world industrial problem i.e., electronic note-taking in form processing.

Such systems typically weight the sentiment conveyed by text segments in accordance with these segments' roles in the structure of a text, as identified by deep linguistic processing. Conversely, state-of-the-art machine learning polarity classifiers typically aim to exploit patterns in vector representations of texts, mostly covering the occurrence of words or word groups in these texts. However, since structural aspects of content have been shown to contain valuable information as well, we propose to use structure-based features in vector representations of text. We evaluate the usefulness of our novel features on collections of English reviews in various domains. Our experimental results suggest that, even though word-based features are indispensable to good polarity classifiers, structure-based sentiment information provides valuable additional guidance that can help significantly improve the polarity classification performance of machine learning classifiers. The most informative features capture the sentiment conveyed by specific rhetorical elements that constitute a text's core or provide crucial contextual information. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Machine learning; Rhetorical structure; Sentiment analysis; Support vector machines","Pingdom, (2012) Internet 2011 in Numbers, , http://royal.pingdom.com/2012/01/17/internet-2011-in-numbers/, available online; Mangnoesing, G., Van Bunningen, A., Hogenboom, A., Hogenboom, F., Frasincar, F., An empirical study for determining relevant features for sentiment summarization of online conversational documents (2012) 13th International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE 2012), 7651 VOL., pp. 567-579. , Lecture Notes in Computer Science Springer; Hogenboom, A., Heerschop, B., Frasincar, F., Kaymak, U., De Jong, F., Multi-lingual support for lexicon-based sentiment analysis guided by semantics (2014) Decision Support Systems, 66 (1), pp. 43-53; Madden, S., From Databases to Big Data (2012) IEEE Internet Computing, 16 (3), pp. 4-6; Chan, S., Beyond keyword and cue-phrase matching: A sentence-based abstraction technique for information extraction (2006) Decision Support Systems, 42 (2), pp. 759-777; Chang, C., Hsu, C., Lui, S., Automatic information extraction from semi-structured web pages by pattern discovery (2003) Decision Support Systems, 35 (1), pp. 129-147; Wang, X., Jin, X., Chen, M., Zhang, K., Shen, D., Topic mining over asynchronous text sequences (2012) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 24 (1), pp. 156-169; Hogenboom, A., Hogenboom, F., Frasincar, F., Schouten, K., Van Der Meer, O., Semantics-based information extraction for detecting economic events (2013) Multimedia Tools and Applications, 64 (1), pp. 27-52; Balahur, A., Hermida, J., Montoyo, A., Detecting implicit expressions of emotion in text: A comparative analysis (2012) Decision Support Systems, 53 (4), pp. 742-753; Feldman, R., Techniques and applications for sentiment analysis (2013) Communications of the ACM, 56 (4), pp. 82-89; Montoyo, A., Martinez-Barco, P., Balahur, A., Subjectivity and sentiment analysis: An overview of the current state of the area and envisaged developments (2012) Decision Support Systems, 53 (4), pp. 675-679; Reyes, A., Rosso, P., Making objective decisions from subjective data: Detecting irony in customer reviews (2012) Decision Support Systems, 53 (4), pp. 754-760; Jansen, B., Zhang, M., Sobel, K., Chowdury, A., Twitter power: Tweets as electronic word of mouth (2009) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 60 (11), pp. 2169-2188; Rui, H., Liu, Y., Whinston, A., Whose and what chatter matters? the effect of tweets on movie sales (2013) Decision Support Systems, 55 (4), pp. 863-870; Yu, X., Liu, Y., Huang, X., An, A., Mining online reviews for predicting sales performance: A case study in the movie domain (2012) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 24 (4), pp. 720-734; Yu, Y., Duan, W., Cao, Q., The impact of social and conventional media on firm equity value: A sentiment analysis approach (2013) Decision Support Systems, 55 (4), pp. 919-926; Pang, B., Lee, L., Opinion mining and sentiment analysis (2008) Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval, 2 (1), pp. 1-135; Liu, B., Sentiment analysis and opinion mining (2012) Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies, , Morgan & Claypool Publishers; Heerschop, B., Goossen, F., Hogenboom, A., Frasincar, F., Kaymak, U., De Jong, F., Polarity analysis of texts using discourse structure (2011) 20th ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2011), pp. 1061-1070. , Association for Computing Machinery; Hogenboom, A., Bal, M., Frasincar, F., Bal, D., Kaymak, U., De Jong, F., Lexicon-based sentiment analysis by mapping conveyed sentiment to intended sentiment (2014) International Journal of Web Engineering and Technology, 9 (2), pp. 125-147; Chenlo, J., Hogenboom, A., Losada, D., Sentiment-based ranking of blog posts using rhetorical structure theory (2013) 18th International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems (NLDB 2013), 7934 VOL., pp. 13-24. , Lecture Notes in Computer Science Springer; Devitt, A., Ahmad, K., Sentiment polarity identification in financial news: A cohesion-based approach (2007) 45th Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics (ACL 2007), pp. 984-991. , Association for Computational Linguistics; Taboada, M., Voll, K., Brooke, J., (2008) Extracting Sentiment As A Function of Discourse Structure and Topicality, Tech.

They must be executed successfully to obtain the desired results. Unfortunately, faults may happen during its execution due to the dynamic networks or the information asymmetry between developers and users. Therefore, designing effective failure recovery mechanism to ensure the reliability of the composite model execution is essential. Progress has been made in the web service composition field to obtain limited failure recovery capabilities, but not fully applicable to composite models since model services are informational services in essence which do not change the world conditions. This paper proposes a unified framework, integrated with a process ontology and multiple recovery strategies that can provide valuable failure recovery recommendations intelligently. The recovery strategies have been greatly enhanced in providing greater failure recovery capability. Feasibility and efficiency of this framework have been illustrated and tested. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","AI planning; Distributed model composition; Failure recovery; Semantic web","Agarwal, V., Chafle, G., Mittal, S., Srivastava, B., Understanding approaches for web service composition and execution (2008) Proceedings of the 1st Bangalore Annual Compute Conference; Anderson, B.B., Hansen, J.V., Lowry, P.B., Creating automated plans for semantic web applications through planning as model checking (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36 (7), pp. 10595-10603; Baresi, L., Ghezzi, C., Guinea, S., Towards self-healing service compositions.

Cost-sensitive feature selection over the past 10 years has seen increasingly rapid advances. Recently, a fast randomized algorithm was designed for this problem. Unfortunately, the performance of algorithms is heavily dependent on the size of datasets. In this paper, we propose an optimal randomized algorithm which adopts the restart strategy in the fast randomized algorithm for minimal test cost feature selection. The restart strategy can effectively address this limitation which depends on the size of datasets. There are two major stages in our algorithm: the addition stage and the deletion stage. In the addition stage, we obtain a subset to represent the original attributes. In this stage, the randomized mechanism helps us to select a subset rapidly. In the deletion stage, we remove redundant attributes by using the restart strategy to further improve the efficiency. Compared with the fast randomized algorithm, the effective of our algorithm increases sharply in the same runtime. Meanwhile, our algorithm reduces about a quarter of the runtime under the same number of experiments. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Feature selection; Restart strategy; Test cost; Time constraint","Pawlak, Z., Rough sets (1982) Int J Comput Inf Sci, 11, pp. 341-356; Zhao, H., Min, F., Zhu, W., Test-cost-sensitive attribute reduction of data with normal distribution measurement errors (2013) Math Probl Eng, 2013, pp. 1-12; Ślȩzak, D., Ziarko, W., The investigation of the bayesian rough set model (2006) Int J Approx Reason, 40, pp. 81-91; Wang, X.Z., He, Y.L., Wang, D.D., Non-naive bayesian classifiers for classification problems with continuous attributes (2014) IEEE Trans Cybern, 44 (1), pp. 21-39; Nakamatsu, K., Abe, J.M., Suzuki, A., Annotated semantics for defeasible deontic reasoning.

This paper introduces a novel framework for nonlinear metric learning, called kernel density metric learning (KDML), which is easy to use and provides nonlinear, probability-based distance measures. KDML constructs a direct nonlinear mapping from the original input space into a feature space based on kernel density estimation. The nonlinear mapping in KDML embodies established distance measures between probability density functions, and leads to accurate classification on datasets for which existing linear metric learning methods would fail. It addresses the severe challenge to distance-based classifiers when features are from heterogeneous domains and, as a result, the Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance between original feature vectors is not meaningful. We also propose two ways to determine the kernel bandwidths, including an adaptive local scaling approach and an integrated optimization algorithm that learns the Mahalanobis matrix and kernel bandwidths together. KDML is a general framework that can be combined with any existing metric learning algorithm. As concrete examples, we combine KDML with two leading metric learning algorithms, large margin nearest neighbors (LMNN) and neighborhood component analysis (NCA). KDML can naturally handle not only numerical features, but also categorical ones, which is rarely found in previous metric learning algorithms. Extensive experimental results on various datasets show that KDML significantly improves existing metric learning algorithms in terms of classification accuracy. © 2014 IEEE.","classification; kernel density estimation; large margin nearest neighbors; metric learning; neighborhood components analysis","Wang, F., Sun, J., Survey on distance metric learning and dimensionality reduction (2014) Data Mining Knowl.

Measures to preserve this species are urgent. Honeybees inhabit several different environments, from swamps to deserts, from high mountains to the African savannah. They are classified into several different subspecies, each one adapted to a particular set of environmental characteristics. The identification of subspecies is based on morphometric features from the entire bee body, but in the last years features from the fore wings have proven to be very efficient for classification. Several methods have been developed to perform the automatic classification through images of bee wings, and geometric morphometrics has been reported to achieve good results in terms of consumed time and reliability of the results. However, there has been no study evaluating the impact of feature selection and new classification methods on the identification performance. We here evaluate seven combinations of feature selectors and classifiers by their hit ratio with real bee wing images. Feature selection proved to be beneficial to all the evaluated combinations and the Naïve Bayes classifier combined with a correlation-based feature selector achieved the best results. These conclusions can benefit researches that rely on classification by geometric morphometrics features, both for bees and for other animal species. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Apis mellifera; Feature selection; Geometric morphometrics; Machine learning","Basheer, I.A., Hajmeer, M., Artificial neural networks: fundamentals, computing, design, and application (2000) J.

Recently, the learning of sparsifying transforms for data has received interest. The advantage of the transform model is that it enables cheap and exact computations. In Part I of this work, efficient methods for online learning of square sparsifying transforms were introduced and investigated (by numerical experiments). The online schemes process signals sequentially, and can be especially useful when dealing with big data, and for real-time, or limited latency signal processing applications. In this paper, we prove that although the associated optimization problems are non-convex, the online transform learning algorithms are guaranteed to converge to the set of stationary points of the learning problem. The guarantee relies on a few simple assumptions. In practice, the algorithms work well, as demonstrated by examples of applications to representing and denoising signals. © 2015 IEEE.","big data; convergence guarantees; dictionary learning; machine learning; online learning; Sparse representations; sparsifying transforms","Ravishankar, S., Wen, B., Bresler, Y., Online sparsifying transform learning-part I: Algorithms (2015) IEEE J.

This has led to the emergence of multiple forensic applications based on the use of ENF signals. Examples of such applications include validating the time-of-recording of an ENF-containing multimedia signal or estimating its recording location based on concurrent reference signals from power grids. In this paper, we examine a novel ENF-based application that infers the power grid in which the ENF-containing multimedia signal was recorded without relying on the availability of concurrent power references. We investigate features based on the statistical differences in ENF variations between different power grids to serve as signatures for the region-of-recording of the media signal. We use these features in a multiclass machine learning implementation that is able to identify the grid-of-recording of a signal with high accuracy. In addition, we explore techniques for building multiconditional learning systems that can adapt to changes in the noise environment between the training and testing data. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Electric network frequency; information forensics; location-of-recording estimation; machine learning; power grids","Hajj-Ahmad, A., Garg, R., Wu, M., ENF based location classification of sensor recordings Proc.

Moreover, some industries uses third-part manufacturing to increase the production capacity for short periods. This paper proposes, implements and evaluates an ACO algorithm to solve the parallel machine scheduling problem with outsourcing allowed. The goal is to minimize the sum of outsource and delay costs (since, in many practical situations, the delay generates fine). To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to address this problem. In order to evaluate the algorithm proposed, a mathematical programming model of the problem is also presented and implemented. The ACO algorithm proposed is composed of three sequential transition rules, each one responsible for one different decision: the first one decides the next job to be scheduled; the second decides the machine to schedule a job and the third decides if the job must be outsourced or not. Computational results show that this algorithm, for instances of size larger or equal to 20 jobs, could reach better solutions than the ones found using the mathematical programming method when the commercial solver used has its running time limited by 1 h. Moreover, the times required to reach a solution were significantly smaller when the ACO is executed. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ant colony optimization; Outsourcing; Parallel machine scheduling problem","Ali Berrichi, A., Yalaoui, F., Efficient bi-objective ant colony approach to minimize total tardiness and system unavailability for a parallel machine scheduling problem (2013) International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology; Antelo, M., Bru, L., Outsourcing or restructuring: The dynamic choice (2010) International Journal of Production Economics, 123, pp. 1-7; Arenales, M., Armentano, V., Morabito, R., Yanasse, H., (2007) Pesquisa operacional.

Each algorithm generates best results for a particular set of input features and configurations of the objects/regions in the input image (environment). To obtain the best possible result of processing in a reliable manner, we propose an algorithm selection approach that selects the best algorithm for a each input image. The proposed algorithm selection starts by first selecting an algorithm using low level features such as color intensity, histograms, spectral coefficients or so and a user given context if available. The resulting high-level image description is analyzed for logical inconsistencies (contradictions) and image regions that must be processed using a different algorithm are selected. The high-level description and the optional user-given context are used by a Bayesian Network to estimate the cause of the error in the processing. The same Bayesian Network also generates new candidate algorithm for each region containing the contradiction in an iterative manner. This iterative selection stops when the high-level inconsistencies are all resolved or no more different algorithms can be selected. We also show that when inconsistencies can be detected, our framework is able to improve high-level description when compared with single algorithms. In order for such complex and iterative processing being computationally tractable we also introduce a hardware platform based on reconfigurable VLSI that is well suited as the platform of the proposed approach. We show that the algorithm selected approach is ideally suited for either a hybrid type VLSI processor or for a Logic-In-Memory processing platform. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Algorithm selection; Bayesian networks; Contour extraction; Image processing","Chau, C.-P., Siu, W.-C., Adaptive dual-point hough transform for object recognition (2004) J Comput Vision Image Underst, 96, pp. 1-16; Krivic, J., Solina, F., Part-level object recognition using superquadrics (2004) Int J Comput Vision Image Underst, 95, pp. 105-126; Kosecka, J., Zhang, W., Extraction, matching, and pose recovery based on dominant rectangular structures (2005) Int J Comput Vision Image Underst, 100, pp. 274-293; Leibe, B., Leonardis, A., Schiele, B., Robust object detection with interleaved categorization and segmentation (2008) Int J Comput Vision, 77, pp. 259-289; Hoiem, D., Efros, A.A., Hebert, M., (2008) Closing the loop on scene interpretation, , In: Proc. computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR; Heitz, G., Gould, S., Saxena, A., Koller, D., (2008) Cascaded classification models: combining models for holistic scene understanding, , In, Neural information processing systems (NIPS:; Li, L.-J., Socher, R., Fei-Fei, L., Towards total scene understanding: classification (2009) annotation and segmentation in an automatic framework, , In, Computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR:; Ladicky, L., Russell, C., Kohli, P., Torr, P., Graph cut based inference with co-occurrence statistics (2010) In: Proceedings of the 11th European conference on computer vision; Brox, T., Bourdev, L., Maji, S., Malik, J., Object segmentation by alignment of poselet activations to image contours (2011) In: IEEE international conference on computer vision and pattern recognition; Ion, A., Carreira, J., Sminchisescu, C., Probabilistic joint image segmentation and labeling (2011) In: 25th conference on neural information processing systems; Carreira, J., Li, F., Sminchisescu, C., Object recognition by sequential figure-ground ranking (2012) Int J Comput Vision, 98 (3), pp. 243-262; Matsuyama, T., Knowledge-based aerial image understanding systems and expert systems for image processing (1987) IEEE Trans Geosci Remote Sens GE-25(3), p. 305; Hotz, L., Neumann, B., Scene interpretation as a configuration task. tech (2005) rep; Ferryman, J., Borg, M., Thirde, D., Fusier, F., Valentin, V., Bremond, F., Thonnat, M., Kampel, M., Automated scene understanding for airport aprons (2005) In: Proceedings of 18th Australian joint conference on artificial intelligence, , Springer, Sidney:; Perera, A.G.A., Brooksby, G., Hoogs, A., Doretto, G., Moving object segmentation using scene understanding (2006) In: Conference on computer vision and pattern recognition; Kembhavi, A., Yeh, T., Davis, L., Why did the person cross the road (there)?

Recently, an efficient algorithm for mining class association rules, named CAR-Miner, has been proposed. It, however, consumes a lot of memory for storing the Obidsets (sets of object identifiers that contain itemsets) of itemsets and requires a lot of time to compute the intersection between two Obidsets, especially in the large datasets. This paper proposes an improved algorithm for mining class association rules that uses the difference between two Obidsets (d2O) to save memory usage and run time. Firstly, the d2O concept is developed. A strategy for reducing the storage space and computation time of d2O is then derived. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than CAR-Miner in terms of run time and memory usage. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

More in detail, it is based on the knowledge of the uncertainty of the features constituting the 3D image (obtained processing a pair of two 2D stereoscopic images) and on a suitable statistical approach providing a confidence level to the classification result. These pieces of information are then managed in order to improve the classification performance in terms of correct classification and false reject percentages. The experimental results, obtained applying the methodology on an Active Appearance Models algorithm for feature detection and triangulating the 3D features, show that, compared with a basic approach (which generally does not take into account the uncertainty on 3D features), the proposed methodology allows to significantly improve the classification performance even in scenarios characterized by a high uncertainty. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This way, feature selection has become an important issue on these researching areas. Nevertheless, as in past years the number of patterns and, more specifically, the number of features to be selected have grown very fast, parallel processing constitutes an important tool to reach efficient approaches that make possible to tackle complex problems within reasonable computing times. In this paper we propose parallel multi-objective optimization approaches to cope with high-dimensional feature selection problems. Several parallel multi-objective evolutionary alternatives are proposed, and experimentally evaluated by using some synthetic and BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) benchmarks. The experimental results show that the cooperation of parallel evolving subpopulations provides improvements in the solution quality and computing time speedups depending on the parallel alternative and data profile. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

DNA pooling is an attempt to address this issue by combining multiple DNA samples prior to genotyping. Instead of genotyping the DNA samples of the individuals, a mixture of DNA samples (i.e. the pool) from the individuals is genotyped only once. This greatly reduces the cost of genotyping. Pooled samples are subject to greater genotyping inaccuracies than individual samples. Wrong genotyping will lead to wrong biological conclusions. It is thus required to calibrate the resulting genotypes (allele frequencies). Methods: We present a regression based approach to translate raw array output to allele frequency. During training, few pools and the individuals that constitute the pools are genotyped. Given the genotypes of individuals that constitute the pool, we compute the true allele frequency. We then train a regression algorithm to produce a mapping between the raw array outputs to the true allele frequency. We test the algorithm using pool samples withheld from the training set. During prediction, we use this map to genotype pools with no prior knowledge of the individuals constituting the pools. Results and discussion: After data quality control we have available a dataset comprised of 912 pools. We estimate allele frequency using three approaches: the raw data, a commonly used piecewise linear transformation, and the proposed local-global learner fusion method. The resulting RMS errors for the three approaches are 0.135, 0.120, and 0.080 respectively. © 2015.","Allele frequency calibration; DNA pooling; Machine learning; Microarray; SNP genotyping","Barratt, B.J., Payne, F., Rance, H.E., Nutland, S., Todd, J., Clayton, D.G., Identification of the sources of error in allele frequency estimations from pooled DNA indicates an optimal experimental design (2009) Ann.

Considering that the water quality of a given water body is necessarily evaluated through the analysis of some biological, physical and chemical parameters, mathematical and computational models able to describe the behavior of such parameters can be a useful tool, given their ability to generate scenarios and, as a consequence, the possibility to support decisions regarding water resources management. In this work Inverse Problems techniques are applied to estimate the source parameters (location and intensity) of a hypothetical conservative pollutant released in estuarine waters. The case study considered here is the Macaé River estuary, located in the Brazilian southeast coast. The pollutant transport was modeled by the advection-diffusion equation. For the source location estimation were used the Luus-Jaakola (LJ), the particle collision algorithm (PCA) and the ant colony optimization (ACO) methods, and to estimate the source intensity was used the golden section (GS) method. In this study, synthetic sampling data of concentrations with and without noise were used. For the noiseless data, all methods have successfully achieved the objective function target low value in more than 95% of executions. On the other hand, for the data with ±5% of noise level, that happened only in 80% of the runs. Considering the number of different estimated points on the location and also the computational cost, the method LJ-GS showed the best performance. The results of this study demonstrated the feasibility of the inverse problem approach to estimate with satisfactory accuracy the location and intensity of a given pollutant source released in estuarine environments, which can also contribute to possible environmental liabilities identification. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Despite a myriad of research work in the last two decades, optimization of traffic signals in network level is still an open research problem. This paper for the first time employs advanced cuckoo search optimization algorithm for optimally tuning parameters of intelligent controllers. Neural Network (NN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are two intelligent controllers implemented in this study. For the sake of comparison, we also implement Q-learning and fixed-time controllers as benchmarks. Comprehensive simulation scenarios are designed and executed for a traffic network composed of nine four-way intersections. Obtained results for a few scenarios demonstrate the optimality of trained intelligent controllers using the cuckoo search method. The average performance of NN, ANFIS, and Q-learning controllers against the fixed-time controller are 44%, 39%, and 35%, respectively. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For its early management and accurate prognosis, there is a need to develop automated and non-invasive computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technique(s). The present study proposes a novel region-of-interest (ROI) based CAD technique using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to discriminate PD patients from healthy subjects. A volumetric 3D T1-weighted (1 mm isovoxel) MRI of 30 PD patients and age & gender matched 30 healthy subjects is acquired on a 1.5 T MRI scanner. Five well-documented regions affected in PD, namely substantia nigra (SN), thalamus, hippocampus, frontal lobe (FL) and mid-brain are analyzed individually and in combinations of pairs and triplets. Features are constructed from gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) values of voxel from these regions. A small set of discriminating and non-redundant features is selected using mutual information based approach in conjunction with unpaired two-tailed two-sample t-test based ranking. A decision model is built with the help of support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier. The performance of the decision model is evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy with leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to differentiate PD from healthy subjects with a maximum accuracy of 86.67% with SN for GM and combination of SN & FL for WM; and outperforms the voxel-based morphometry method. Furthermore, loss in GM and WM volume and gain in CSF volume is observed in PD patients in comparison to healthy subjects. The excellent performance of the proposed method is beneficial for clinicians as it can be used as a decision support system which requires less time and efforts in diagnosing PD. In addition, it also encourages the application of CAD in medical domain. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Iron supplement and especially Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) have become the treatment of choice for that anemia. However, it is very complicated to find an adequate treatment for every patient in each particular situation since dosage guidelines are based on average behaviors, and thus, they do not take into account the particular response to those drugs by different patients, although that response may vary enormously from one patient to another and even for the same patient in different stages of the anemia. This work proposes an advance with respect to previous works that have faced this problem using different methodologies (Machine Learning (ML), among others), since the diversity of the CKD population has been explicitly taken into account in order to produce a general and reliable model for the prediction of ESA/Iron therapy response. Furthermore, the ML model makes use of both human physiology and drug pharmacology to produce a model that outperforms previous approaches, yielding Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) of the Hemoglobin (Hb) prediction around or lower than 0.6. g/dl in the three countries analyzed in the study, namely, Spain, Italy and Portugal. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Anemia; Chronic Kidney Disease; Hemoglobin; Machine learning; Prediction","Lankhorst, C.E., Wish, J.B., Anemia in renal disease. diagnosis and management (2010) Blood Rev., 24 (1), pp. 39-47; Ly, J., Marticorena, R., Donnelly, S., Red blood cell survival in chronic renal failure (2004) Am.

In the past, competition on the manufacturing of the bearing outer rings has primarily focused on the product hardness. Other quality characteristics of stain yield and roundness performance have recently become equally critical to fulfill customer satisfaction. To simultaneously meet all requirement criteria, the multiple response surface optimisation has focused on the use of desirability function approach to combine multiple response criteria into a single performance measure and to determine the optimal process design parameters of a pre-heat and heat chamber heaters, number of vacuum, gas fan speed in quenching chamber and partial gas pressure. This study proposed integrated algorithms with Taguchi orthogonal design and analysis and desirability function approach in forms of the path of composite ascent. There are three phases which use the conventional aspect of the steepest ascent via influential parameters, designed for moving toward the optiumum, use the ant colony optimisation (ACO) and hunting search (HuS) mechanism to present getting stuck at the local optimum. Results demonstrate that the integrated algorithms with the ACO and HuS elements are superior to the use of conventional composite ascent algorithm on average of 15.11 and 16.43 % improvement, respectively, for the overall responses. The confirmation tests on the actual manufacturing process based on the predicted operating conditions were verified and carried out to show statistically significant improvement at 95 % confidence interval. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ant colony optimisation;

For the semisupervised tensor classification, the existing transductive support tensor machine (TSTM) needs to resort to iterative technique, which is very time-consuming. In order to overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we extend the concave-convex procedure-based transductive support vector machine (CCCP-TSVM) to the tensor patterns and propose a low-rank approximation-based TSTM, in which the tensor rank-one decomposition is used to compute the inner product of the tensors. Theoretically, concave-convex procedure-based TSTM (CCCP-TSTM) is an extension of the linear CCCP-TSVM to tensor patterns. When the input patterns are vectors, CCCP-TSTM degenerates into the linear CCCP-TSVM. A set of experiments is conducted on 23 semisupervised classification tasks, which are generated from seven second-order face data sets, three third-order gait data sets, and two third-order image data sets, to illustrate the performance of the CCCP-TSTM. The results show that compared with CCCP-TSVM and TSTM, CCCP-TSTM provides significant performance gain in terms of test accuracy and training speed. © 1992-2012 IEEE.","Concave-convex procedure; semi-supervised tensor classification; tensor rank-one decomposition; transductive support tensor machine (TSTM); transductive support vector machine (TSVM)","Joachims, T., Transductive inference for text classification using support vector machines Proc. 16th Int.

The cascaded model is a two-level network in which the outputs of the first level (J<inf>SC</inf>, V<inf>OC</inf>, and FF) are the inputs of the second level, and the ultimate end-point is the overall PCE of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The model combines quantum chemical methods and machine learning methods, further including quantum chemical calculations, data division, feature selection, regression, and validation steps. To improve the efficiency of the model and reduce the redundancy and noise of the molecular descriptors, six feature selection methods (multiple linear regression, genetic algorithms, mean impact value, forward selection, backward elimination, and +n-m algorithm) are used with the support vector machine. The best established cascaded model predicts the PCE values of DSSCs with a MAE of 0.57 (%), which is about 10% of the mean value PCE (5.62%). The validation parameters according to the OECD principles are R2(0.75), Q2(0.77), and Qcv2 (0.76), which demonstrate the great goodness-of-fit, predictivity, and robustness of the model. Additionally, the applicability domain of the cascaded QSAR model is defined for further application. This study demonstrates that the established cascaded model is able to effectively predict the PCE for organic dye sensitizers with very low cost and relatively high accuracy, providing a useful tool for the design of dye sensitizers with high PCE. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","dye-sensitizer solar cells; machine learning methods; organic dye sensitizers; power conversion efficiency; quantitative structure activity relationship; quantum chemical calculations","O'regan, B., Grätzel, M., (1991) Nature, 353, p. 737; Grätzel, M., (2009) Acc.

A multitude of sensors and systems have been developed to assist people in traffic monitoring. Camera-based systems have enjoyed wide adoption over the last decade, partially substituting for more traditional techniques. Methods based on road-pavement vibration are not as common as camera-based systems. However, vibration sensors may be of interest when sensors must be out of sight and insensitive to environmental conditions, such as fog. We present and discuss our work on detection and classification of vehicles by measurement of road-pavement vibration and by means of supervised machine learning. We describe the entire processing chain from sensor data acquisition to vehicle classification and discuss our results for the task of vehicle detection and the task of vehicle classification separately. Using data for a single vibration sensor, our results show a performance ranging between 94% and near 100% for the detection task (1340 samples) and between 43% and 86% for the classification task (experiment specific, between 454 and 1243 samples). 2015 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC","Digital Signal Processing; Machine Learning; Road Vehicle Detection and Classification; Vibration Sensors",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929603518

The answer to this question turns on the more fundamental question: what is intelligence? I propose that two metaphors for intelligence are informative. On the one hand is intelligence through top-down engineered computation and code, what might be called the executive metaphor for intelligence. On the other is emergent intelligence, in which intelligence emerges as the outcome of an infinitude of negotiations between multitudinous cognitive agents. Emergent intelligence is the logic of the core biological principle of homeostasis: the emergence of persistent and low-entropy disequilibria. Architecture and engineering, in contrast, have long been immersed in the executive metaphor for intelligence. I suggest architects and engineers will be able to build a truly intelligent building when they embody within their constructions the emergent metaphor for intelligence. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","adaptability; artificial intelligence; cognitive studies; ecological design; evolutionary systems",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929593774

Mc-FCFLN network consists of two components: a cognitive component and a meta-cognitive one. A fully complex-valued functional link network (FCFLN) is a cognitive component and the self-regulatory learning method is its meta-cognitive component. As the network does not possess hidden layers, the multi-variable polynomials are represented in the input layer for capturing the nonlinear relationship between the input and the output sample. Moreover, when the sample is presented to the Mc-FCFLN network, the meta-cognitive component decides what to learn, when to learn, and how to learn depending on the knowledge gained by the FCFLN network and the novel information present in the sample. The network can learn sample one after the other and thus the drawback existing with the batch learning strategy can be eliminated while orthogonal least square principle is used for selecting the best polynomial and the recursive least square update is used for tuning the network. Multi-category and binary datasets chosen from the UCI machine learning repository is used for the validation of the proposed classifier. Lastly, a performance comparison of the Mc-FCFLN applied for classification problems shows better classification ability when compared with the other existing classifiers in the literature. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To this aim, a soil bin facility assisted with a single-wheel tester was used for the synthesis of the objective parameter. Four levels of slip were induced to the wheel along with three levels of velocity and two wheel loads. The stochastic characteristic of soil–wheel interactions promoted the authors to apply two promising artificial intelligence approaches of artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and compare the results with the statistical approach of multiple linear regression (MLR). Various structures of ANN and ANFIS tools were constructed to obtain the best representations. Two statistical performance criteria of mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (Formula presented.) were employed to assess the potential of the constructed models. In view of the employed criteria, it was divulged that the supervised ANN outperformed the ANFIS model with MSE and (Formula presented.) values of 0.02615 and 0.93628, respectfully, where ANFIS model yielded MSE and (Formula presented.) values equal to 0.0439 and 0.8494, respectfully. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","ANFIS; ANN; MLR; Single-wheel; Soil bin",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929428437

Crack detection using microwave sensors is typically based on human observation of change in the sensor’s signal (pattern) depicted on a high-resolution screen of the test equipment. However, as demonstrated in this work, implementing artificial intelligence to classify cracked from non-cracked surfaces has appreciable impact in terms of sensing sensitivity, cost, and automation. Furthermore, applying artificial intelligence for post-processing data collected from microwave sensors is a cornerstone for handheld test equipment that can outperform rack equipment with large screens and sophisticated plotting features.

Resilience has sometimes been favored for threats that are unknown, unquantifiable, systemic, and unlikely/catastrophic. This paper addresses the suitability of each paradigm for such threats, finding that they are comparably suitable. Threats are rarely completely unknown or unquantifiable; what limited information is typically available enables the use of both paradigms. Either paradigm can in practice mishandle systemic or unlikely/catastrophic threats, but this is inadequate implementation of the paradigms, not inadequacy of the paradigms themselves. Three examples are described: (a) Venice in the Black Death plague, (b) artificial intelligence (AI), and (c) extraterrestrials. The Venice example suggests effectiveness for each paradigm for certain unknown, unquantifiable, systemic, and unlikely/catastrophic threats. The AI and extraterrestrials examples suggest how increasing resilience may be less effective, and reducing threat probability may be more effective, for certain threats that are significantly unknown, unquantifiable, and unlikely/catastrophic. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Artificial intelligence; Catastrophe; Extraterrestrials; Plague; Resilience; Risk; Uncertainty",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929428324

It is also characterised by a lack of evidence-based data on uncertain risks of in particular engineered nanomaterials. The present paper aims at deepening understanding of the collective decision making context at international level using the grounded theory approach as proposed by Glaser and Strauss in “The Discovery of Grounded Theory” (1967). This starts by discussing relevant concepts from different fields including sociological and political studies of international relations as well as political philosophy and ethics. This analysis of current trends in international law making is taken as starting point for exploring the role that a software decision support tool could play in multi-stakeholder global governance of nanotechnologies. These theoretical ideas are then compared with the current design of the SUN Decision Support System (SUNDS) under development in the European project on Sustainable Nanotechnologies (SUN, www.sun-fp7.eu). Through constant comparison, the ideas are also compared with requirements of different stakeholders as expressed during a user workshop.

Recently, it has come to our attention that a number of misplaced notions and misunderstandings are being dissipated on the relationships between ELM and some earlier works. This paper wishes to clarify that (1) ELM theories manage to address the open problem which has puzzled the neural networks, machine learning and neuroscience communities for 60 years: whether hidden nodes/neurons need to be tuned in learning, and proved that in contrast to the common knowledge and conventional neural network learning tenets, hidden nodes/neurons do not need to be iteratively tuned in wide types of neural networks and learning models (Fourier series, biological learning, etc.). Unlike ELM theories, none of those earlier works provides theoretical foundations on feedforward neural networks with random hidden nodes; (2) ELM is proposed for both generalized single-hidden-layer feedforward network and multi-hidden-layer feedforward networks (including biological neural networks); (3) homogeneous architecture-based ELM is proposed for feature learning, clustering, regression and (binary/multi-class) classification. (4) Compared to ELM, SVM and LS-SVM tend to provide suboptimal solutions, and SVM and LS-SVM do not consider feature representations in hidden layers of multi-hidden-layer feedforward networks either. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Extreme learning machine; Feedforward neural network; QuickNet; Radial basis function network; Random vector functional link; Randomness",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929427683

As a worn milling tool might irreversibly damage a workpiece, there is a vital demand for a TCM system to evaluate the tool wear progress, or equivalently the resultant surface roughness, nonintrusively. To build up a condition monitoring system for HSM processes, sensor signals are to be utilized to form a reference model that reflects the performance of the system. Therefore, a desired reference model has to apply more efficient feature extraction and artificial intelligence techniques to be more repeatable and generalizable. This paper illustrates the performance of clustering techniques on high-speed end milling experimental data. Studied clustering methods are applied to the wavelet features of force and vibration signals to illustrate the repeatability of their results. It is shown that clustering methods can coarsely capture the status of the process and can be applied for fault diagnosis and TCM purposes. It is also discussed how the application of clustering methods may improve the performance of existing reference models toward the more efficient utilization of available experimental data and to develop easily generalizable reference models. Finally, a possible application of clustering results is discussed comparing with state-of-the-art papers.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929601028

In P-DeLP,a conclusion succeeds if there exists an argument that entails the conclusion and this argument is found to be undefeated by a warrant procedure that systematically explores the universe of arguments in order to present an exhaustive synthesis of the relevant chains of pros and cons for the given conclusion. Recently, we have proposed a new warrant recursive semantics for P-DeLP, called Recursive P-DeLP (RP-DeLP for short), based on the claim that the acceptance of an argument should imply also the acceptance of all its sub-arguments which reflect the different premises on which the argument is based. This paper explores the relationship between the exhaustive dialectical analysis-based semantics of P-DeLP and the recursive-based semantics of RP-DeLP, and analyses a non-monotonic inference operator for RP-DeLP which models the expansion of a given program by adding new weighted facts associated with warranted conclusions. Given the recursive-based semantics of RP-DeLP, we have also implemented an argumentation framework for RP-DeLP that is able to compute not only the output of warranted and blocked conclusions, but also explain the reasons behind the status of each conclusion. We have developed this framework as a stand-alone application with a simple text-based input/output interface to be able to use it as part of other artificial intelligence systems. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","argumentation; Defeasible reasoning; dialectical semantics; non-monotonic inference; recursive semantics",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929603554

However, there are some difficulties in this type of definition, because a property that defines itself leads to a kind of circular argument. In this study, we address this self-referential problem by category theory. In category theory, the identity arrow can be decomposed into a monomorphism and an epimorphism, which are called a section and a retraction, respectively. We consider the level of difference between the arrow and its elements as being retractions. By taking account of interaction between these different levels, we show that dynamical properties emerge through the identity function.

However, available labeled data are insufficient in many applications. Active learning (AL) and domain adaptation (DA) are two strategies to minimize the required amount of labeled data for model training. AL requires the domain expert to label a small number of highly informative examples to facilitate classification, while DA involves tuning the source domain knowledge for classification on the target domain. In this paper, we demonstrate how AL can efficiently minimize the required amount of labeled data for DA. Since the source and target domains usually have different distributions, it is possible that the domain expert may not have sufficient knowledge to answer each query correctly. We exploit our active DA framework to handle incorrect labels provided by domain experts.

The study used both hyperspectral measurements and RGB images of waste and gold-bearing particles from the Sunrise Dam Gold Mine as input to the discriminating method. Advanced feature extraction methods were employed to capture visual cues such as texture and colour from the RGB images, which were combined with hyperspectral features to give nine types of representative features. Feature selection was applied to groups of the representative features and resulting feature subsets were evaluated using three machine learning algorithms, namely a support vector machine, a naïve Bayes classifier, and a majority decision table, to identify a highly informative subset of features. Cost-sensitive training was used to minimise the nominal profit lost due to sorting error based on real cost values from the milling process, with the aim of economically balancing the ore acceptance rate with the waste rejection rate. A cost-blind support vector machine achieved an ore acceptance rate of 84 % and a waste rejection rate of 87 %, which resulted in $0.98 nominal profit lost per tonne of crushed rock particles. Cost-sensitive training reduced the nominal profit lost to $0.34 per tonne, undercutting the costs associated with refining all particles by $0.24 per tonne. © 2015 International Association for Mathematical Geosciences","Feature selection; Gold; Hyperspectral reflectance; MetaCost; Ore classification; Support vector machine",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929193542

For this purpose, a set of data collected from 32 children with different attention skills is analyzed during their interaction with a set of puzzle games. The authors of this study hypothesize that participants with better performance may have quantifiably different eye-movement patterns from users with poorer results. The use of eye trackers outside the research community may help to extend their potential with available intelligent therapies, bringing state-of-the-art technologies to users. The use of gaze data constitutes a new information source in intelligent therapies that may help to build new approaches that are fully-customized to final users’ needs. This may be achieved by implementing machine learning algorithms for classification. The initial study of the dataset has proven a 0.88 (±0.11) classification accuracy with a random forest classifier, using cross-validation and hierarchical tree-based feature selection. Further approaches need to be examined in order to establish more detailed attention behaviors and patterns among children with and without attention problems. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Attention; Children; Eye tracker; Intelligent therapies; Serious games","Samuelsson, I.P., Carlsson, M.A., The playing learning child: Towards a pedagogy of early childhood (2008) Scand.

There have been a lot of interests in this field because haplotypes have been shown to contain promising data for disease association research. It is proved that haplotype reconstruction in Minimum Error Correction model is an NP-hard problem. Therefore, several methods such as clustering techniques, evolutionary algorithms, neural networks and swarm intelligence approaches have been proposed in order to solve this problem in appropriate time. In this paper, we have focused on various evolutionary clustering techniques and try to find an efficient technique for solving haplotype reconstruction problem. It can be referred from our experiments that the clustering methods relying on the behaviour of honey bee colony in nature, specifically bees algorithm and artificial bee colony methods, are expected to result in more efficient solutions.

Gradient learning models aim at learning the gradient vector of some target functions in supervised learning problems, which can be further used to applications, such as variable selection, coordinate covariance estimation, and supervised dimension reduction. However, existing GL models are not robust to outliers or heavy-tailed noise. This paper provides an RGL framework to address this problem in both regression and classification. This is achieved by introducing a robust regression loss function and proposing a robust classification loss. Moreover, our RGL algorithm works in an instance-based kernelized dictionary instead of some fixed reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which may provide more flexibility. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, a simple computational algorithm based on gradient descent is provided and the convergence of the proposed method is also analyzed. We then apply the proposed RGL model to applications, such as nonlinear variable selection and coordinate covariance estimation. The efficiency of our proposed model is verified on both synthetic and real data sets.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929191754

The obstetricians describe CTG shortly as a continuous electronic record of the baby's heart rate took from the mother's abdomen. The acquired information is necessary to visualize unhealthiness of the embryo and gives an opportunity for early intervention prior to happening a permanent impairment to the embryo. The aim of the machine learning methods is by using attributes of data obtained from the uterine contraction (UC) and fetal heart rate (FHR) signals to classify as pathological or normal.

Firstly, the discriminant feature learning is proposed to learn the cross-modality feature representation. Then, we used common subspace learning based method to reduce the obtained cross-modality features. Finally, Voting ELM is utilized as the classifier to improve the recognition accuracy and to speed up the feature learning process.

The classic imputation strategy based on the K nearest neighbours (KNN) has been widely used to solve the plague problem. However, former studies do not give much attention to feature relevance, which has a significant impact on the selection of nearest neighbours. As a result, biased results may appear in similarity measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel method to impute missing data, named feature weighted grey KNN (FWGKNN) imputation algorithm. This approach employs mutual information (MI) to measure feature relevance. We present an experimental evaluation for five UCI datasets in three missingness mechanisms with various missing rates. Experimental results show that feature relevance has a non-ignorable influence on missing data estimation based on grey theory, and our method is considered superior to the other four estimation strategies. Moreover, the classification bias can be significantly reduced by using our approach in classification tasks. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Feature relevance; Grey theory; K nearest neighbours; Missing data; Mutual information",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929120038

The emergence of stochastically varying network environments critically affects routing in WMNs. Any routing policy meant for WMNs must be quickly adaptive and evolve in a decentralized self organizing and self configuring manner. This paper firstly proposes formulation of a soft computing i.e. fuzzy logic based hybrid performance metric which includes per flow (throughput, delay and jitter) as well as per node (residual energy of the node) parameters. This fuzzy logic based hybrid performance metric enumerates the integrated link cost (ILC) which is used as distance measure between two adjacent nodes. The paper further proposes three routing algorithms based upon nature inspired computing approaches namely firefly algorithm, Big Bang Big Crunch and Ant Colony Optimization. The proposed routing approaches aim at finding the minimal ILC path within a stipulated time constraint. The time constraint is governed by the mobility of network nodes. Extensive simulations were conducted for various WMN topologies. The results of the proposed approaches have been compared with two commonly used conventional approaches and were found to be far more superior. It was also observed that the self organizing capability of the proposed nature inspired routing approaches effectively reduces the complexity and makes a network quite adaptive to the dynamic network behavior found in WMNs. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Ant Colony Optimization; Big Bang Big Crunch; Firefly algorithm; Nature inspired computing; Wireless mesh network",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929095520

It is significant and feasible to utilize the big data to make better decisions by machine learning techniques. In this paper, we focus on batch reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs) with large discrete or continuous state spaces, aiming to learn the best possible policy given a fixed amount of training data. The batch RL algorithms with handcrafted feature representations work well for low-dimensional MDPs. However, for many real-world RL tasks which often involve high-dimensional state spaces, it is difficult and even infeasible to use feature engineering methods to design features for value function approximation. To cope with high-dimensional RL problems, the desire to obtain data-driven features has led to a lot of works in incorporating feature selection and feature learning into traditional batch RL algorithms. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on automatic feature selection and unsupervised feature learning for high-dimensional batch RL. Moreover, we present recent theoretical developments on applying statistical learning to establish finite-sample error bounds for batch RL algorithms based on weighted L<inf>p</inf> norms.

The compensation capability of UPQC is enhanced by the optimal regulation of DC link voltage. Among all power quality (PQ) distortions, voltage sag is the severe PQ problem that significantly deteriorates the regulation of DC link voltage. The conventional approaches utilize a fixed gain PI controller that increases the error between the reference and actual DC link voltage under sag condition. This ultimately results in poor compensation of PQ distortions at the point of common coupling. To enhance compensation capability, the performance of ACT is examined with analytical and artificial intelligence techniques. The model reference adaptive system (MRAS) is used in the analytical method for online self tuning PI controller. For artificial intelligence technique, the off-line trained ANFIS is processed in the simulation studies. The performance of ACT based UPQC is validated in Matlab/Simulink and the obtained results are compared with conventional scheme.

In order to derive such result, some assumptions on the problem are required; moreover, even when convergence is fast, the constants characterizing the bounds are often quite loose. In this work, we prove new Rademacher complexity (RC) based bounds, which do not require any additional assumptions for achieving a fast convergence rate (Formula presented.) in the optimistic case and a slow rate (Formula presented.) in the general case. At the same time, they are characterized by smaller constants with respect to other state-of-the-art RC fast converging alternatives in literature. The results proposed in this work are obtained by exploiting the fundamental work of Talagrand on concentration inequalities for product measures and empirical processes. As a further issue, we also provide the extension of the results to the semi-supervised learning framework, showing how additional unlabeled samples allow improving the tightness of the derived bound. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Fast rates; Performance estimation; Rademacher complexity; Statistical learning theory",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929104006

The Mahalanobis distance builds an accurate relationship between each variable and its corresponding category. It is utilized to calculate the local distance between vectors in MTS. Then we use DTW to align those MTS which are out of synchronization or with different lengths. After that, how to learn an accurate Mahalanobis distance function becomes another key problem. This paper establishes a LogDet divergence-based metric learning with triplet constraint model which can learn Mahalanobis matrix with high precision and robustness.

There are many parameters which have great influence on springback. Hence, selection of appropriate controllable parameters may lead to spingback reduction. In the present work an attempt has been made to find optimal combination of L-bending parameters (i.e. die temperature, step distance, lower punch radius, die clearance and step height) regarding minimum springback. Here, combination of finite element model (which was validated through trial experiments) and Taguchi experimental design were used to form design matrix. Then adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was then applied to correlate intelligent relationships between process inputs and springback. The accuracy of developed ANFIS model was compared with FE model and experimental testing data. Finally, the teaching learning based optimization algorithm was combined with the developed ANFIS model to minimize the springback.

Most existing social network platforms, however, face the challenges of dealing with undesirable users and their malicious spam activities that disseminate content, malware, viruses, etc. to the legitimate users of the service. The spreading of spam degrades user experience and also negatively impacts server-side functions such as data mining, user behavior analysis, and resource recommendation. In this paper, an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based supervised machine is proposed for effective spammer detection. The work first constructs the labeled dataset through crawling Sina Weibo data and manually classifying corresponding users into spammer and non-spammer categories. A set of features is then extracted from message content and user behavior and applies them to the ELM-based spammer classification algorithm. The experiment and evaluation show that the proposed solution provides excellent performance with a true positive rate of spammers and non-spammers reaching 99 and 99.95 %, respectively. As the results suggest, the proposed solution could achieve better reliability and feasibility compared with existing SVM-based approaches. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Extreme learning machine; Machine learning; Social network; Spammer",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928974824

Among the families of LA, Estimator Algorithms (EAs) are certainly the fastest, and of these, the family of discretized algorithms are proven to converge even faster than their continuous counterparts. However, it has recently been reported that the previous proofs for -optimality for all the reported algorithms for the past three decades have been flawed. We applaud the researchers who discovered this flaw, and who further proceeded to rectify the proof for the Continuous Pursuit Algorithm (CPA). The latter proof examines the monotonicity property of the probability of selecting the optimal action, and requires the learning parameter to be continuously changing. In this paper, we provide a new method to prove the -optimality of the Discretized Pursuit Algorithm (DPA) which does not require this constraint, by virtue of the fact that the DPA has, in and of itself, absorbing barriers to which the LA can jump in a discretized manner. Unlike the proof given (Zhang et al., Appl Intell 41:974–985, 3) for an absorbing version of the CPA, which utilizes the single-action Hoeffding’s inequality, the current proof invokes what we shall refer to as the “multi-action” version of the Hoeffding’s inequality. We believe that our proof is both unique and pioneering. It can also form the basis for formally showing the -optimality of the other EAs that possess absorbing states. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Convergence; DPA; Learning automata; Machine learning; Optimality; Pursuit algorithms",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928978582

DTW in combination with one-nearest neighbor, one of the simplest machine learning methods, has been difficult to convincingly outperform on the time series classification task. In this paper, we present a simple technique for time series classification that exploits DTW’s strength on this task. But instead of directly using DTW as a distance measure to find nearest neighbors, the technique uses DTW to create new features which are then given to a standard machine learning method. We experimentally show that our technique improves over one-nearest neighbor DTW on 31 out of 47 UCR time series benchmark datasets. In addition, this method can be easily extended to be used in combination with other methods. In particular, we show that when combined with the symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) method, it improves over it on 37 out of 47 UCR datasets. Thus the proposed method also provides a mechanism to combine distance-based methods like DTW with feature-based methods like SAX. We also show that combining the proposed classifiers through ensembles further improves the performance on time series classification. © 2015 The Author(s)","Dynamic time warping; Symbolic aggregate approximation; Time series classification",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928969452

Fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) error parameters such as scale factors, biases and misalignment errors are relatively unstable, especially with the environmental disturbances and the aging of fiber coils. These uncalibrated error parameters are the main reasons that the precision of FOG-based strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) degraded. This research is mainly on the application of a novel artificial fish swarm algorithm (NAFSA) on FOG error coefficients recalibration/identification. First, the NAFSA avoided the demerits (e.g., lack of using artificial fishes’ pervious experiences, lack of existing balance between exploration and exploitation, and high computational cost) of the standard AFSA during the optimization process. To solve these weak points, functional behaviors and the overall procedures of AFSA have been improved with some parameters eliminated and several supplementary parameters added. Second, a hybrid FOG error coefficients recalibration algorithm has been proposed based on NAFSA and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) approaches. This combination leads to maximum utilization of the involved approaches for FOG error coefficients recalibration. After that, the NAFSA is verified with simulation and experiments and its priorities are compared with that of the conventional calibration method and optimal AFSA. Results demonstrate high efficiency of the NAFSA on FOG error coefficients recalibration. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Error coefficients recalibration; Fiber optic gyroscope; Monte Carlo simulation; Novel artificial fish swarm algorithm; Swarm intelligence optimization","Li, X., Shao, Z., Qian, J., An optimizing method based on autonomous animate: Fish swarm algorithm (2002) Syst.

Kinetic studies revealed three distinct stages of the biosorption process. The pseudo-second order model and the Langmuir model described well the kinetics and equilibrium of the biosorption process, with a determination coefficient, R2>0.99. The value of the mean free energy of adsorption, E, is less than 16kJ/mol at 25°C, suggesting that, at low temperature, the dominant process involved in Cd(II) biosorption by dead T. viride is the chemical ion-exchange. With the temperature increasing to 40-50°C, E values are above 16kJ/mol, showing that the particle diffusion mechanism could play an important role in Cd(II) biosorption.The studies on T. viride growth in Cd(II) solutions and its bioaccumulation performance showed that the living biomass was able to bioaccumulate 100% Cd(II) from a 50. mg/L solution at pH 6.0.The influence of pH, biomass dosage, metal concentration, contact time and temperature on the bioremoval efficiency was evaluated to further assess the biosorption capability of the dead biosorbent. These complex influences were correlated by means of a modeling procedure consisting in data driven approach in which the principles of artificial intelligence were applied with the help of support vector machines (SVM), combined with genetic algorithms (GA). According to our data, the optimal working conditions for the removal of 98.91% Cd(II) by T. viride were found for an aqueous solution containing 26.11. mg/L Cd(II) as follows: pH 6.0, contact time of 3833. min, 8. g/L biosorbent, temperature 46.5°C.

Current attempts for event detection utilize a variety of approaches including statistical, heuristics, machine learning, and optimization methods. Several existing event detection systems share a common feature in which alarms are obtained separately for each of the water quality indicators. Unifying those single alarms from different indicators is usually performed by means of simple heuristics. A salient feature of the current developed approach is using a statistically oriented model for discrete choice prediction which is estimated using the maximum likelihood method for integrating the single alarms. The discrete choice model is jointly calibrated with other components of the event detection system framework in a training data set using genetic algorithms. The fusing process of each indicator probabilities, which is left out of focus in many existing event detection system models, is confirmed to be a crucial part of the system which could be modelled by exploiting a discrete choice model for improving its performance. The developed methodology is tested on real water quality data, showing improved performances in decreasing the number of false positive alarms and in its ability to detect events with higher probabilities, compared to previous studies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Event detection; Logit analysis; Water distribution systems; Water quality; Water security","Adams, J.A., Mccarty, D., Real-time on-line monitoring of drinking water for waterborne pathogen contamination warning (2007) Int.

Most of the work in SRL has focused on modeling and learning from data that only contain discrete variables. As many important problems are characterized by the presence of both continuous and discrete variables, there has been a growing interest in developing hybrid SRL formalisms. Most of these formalisms focus on reasoning and representational issues and, in some cases, parameter learning. What has received little attention is learning the structure of a hybrid SRL model from data. In this paper, we fill that gap and make the following contributions. First, we propose hybrid relational dependency networks (HRDNs), an extension to relational dependency networks that are able to model continuous variables. Second, we propose an algorithm for learning both the structure and parameters of an HRDN from data. Third, we provide an empirical evaluation that demonstrates that explicitly modeling continuous variables results in more accurate learned models than discretizing them prior to learning. © 2015 The Author(s)","Hybrid domains; Statistical relational learning; Structure learning",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928742219

Feed in Tariff mechanism has been applied since 2011 in Malaysia to expand utilization of renewable energy for electricity generation. In this study, a broad range of data is gathered to develop a comprehensive system dynamics model to evaluate the impacts of Feed in Tariff mechanism on the generation mix of Malaysia during a 20-year period between 2011 and 2030. Results demonstrate that although the policy may lead to a satisfactory level of target achievement but the Malaysian government may face an increasing shortage in its RE fund budget starting around 2019 unless it increases its income sources by rising the surcharges on electricity bills or decreases its expenditures by optimizing the amount of FiT payments in different periods. The sensitivity analysis illustrates that the more funding will not lead to a more sustainable generation mix unless it is paid in the right time and in the right direction. Using this model, policymakers can carry out analysis to determine the amount of money that must be collected from the electricity consumers through the surcharges on electricity bills as well as the amount of feed in tariff to be paid for different renewable resources in different periods. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Decision support system; Electricity generation modelling; Energy policy; Feed in tariff; System dynamics","Chua, S.C., Oh, T.H., Green progress and prospect in Malaysia (2011) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 15, pp. 2850-2861; Oh, T.H., Pang, S.Y., Chua, S.C., Energy policy and alternative energy in Malaysia: issues and challenges for sustainable growth (2010) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 14, pp. 1241-1252; Muis, Z.A., Hashim, H., Manan, Z., Taha, F., Douglas, P., Optimal planning of renewable energy-integrated electricity generation schemes with CO2 reduction target (2010) Renew Energy, 35, pp. 2562-2570; (2010), Tenth Malaysia Plan 2011-2015.

Although a variety of hashing methods have been proposed, most of them make some implicit assumptions about the statistical or geometrical structure of data. In fact, few hashing algorithms can adequately handle all kinds of data with different structures. When considering hybrid structure datasets, different hashing algorithms might produce different and possibly inconsistent binary codes. Inspired by the successes of classifier combination and clustering ensembles, in this paper, we present a novel combination strategy for multiple hashing results, named consensus hashing. By defining the measure of consensus of two hashing results, we put forward a simple yet effective model to learn consensus hash functions which generate binary codes consistent with the existing ones. Extensive experiments on several large scale benchmarks demonstrate the overall superiority of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art hashing algorithms. © 2015 The Author(s)",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928752680

This is not always the case, and in situations where data is limited, transfer learning can be applied to compensate for the lack of information by learning from several sources. In this work, we present a novel methodology for inducing a Temporal Nodes Bayesian Network (TNBN) when training data is scarce by applying a transfer learning strategy. A TNBN is a probabilistic graphical model that offers a compact representation for dynamic domains by defining multiple time intervals in which events can occur. Learning a TNBN poses additional challenges to learning traditional Bayesian networks due to the incorporation of time intervals. Our proposal incorporates novel approaches to transfer knowledge from several TNBNs to learn the structure, parameters and intervals of a target TNBN. To evaluate our algorithm, we performed experiments with a synthetic network, where we created auxiliary models by altering the structure, parameters and temporal intervals of the original model. Results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of retrieving a reliable model even when few records are available for the target domain. We also performed experiments with a real-world data set belonging to the medical domain of HIV, where we were able to learn some documented mutational pathways and their temporal relations by applying transfer learning. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Bayesian networks; Knowledge transfer; Temporal reasoning; Transfer learning",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929093483

However, due to the exponential growth of online images, it is necessary to consider searching among large scale images, which is very time-consuming and unscalable. Hence, we need to pay much attention to the efficiency of image detection. In this paper, we propose a fast feature aggregating method for image copy detection which uses machine learning based hashing to achieve fast feature aggregation. Since the machine learning based hashing effectively preserves neighborhood structure of data, it yields visual words with strong discriminability. Furthermore, the generated binary codes leads image representation building to be of low-complexity, making it efficient and scalable to large scale databases.

In order to ensure the health and vigor of the species we depend upon for food and fiber, assisted migration strategies may need to be implemented. This is especially true for long-lived forest trees. Multinomial logit regression was used to develop a Categorical Universal Response Function (CURF) to delineate deployment zones for loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) using 15-year measurements from the Western Gulf Forest Tree Improvement Program (WGFTIP) Geographic Seed Source Study (GSSS). The CURF uses performance categories for the response variable, and the model assigns the probabilities with which the performance for a given seed source will fall into these various categories. First and second powers of minimum temperature of the coldest month, summer precipitation, and variation measures of these two metrics at both the seed source site of origin and the test location were used as independent variables. Planted tree volume, accounting for both survival and growth, was used as the response variable. Model performance was good, with the AUC score ranging from 0.785 to 0.808, depending on (1) whether or not the variable interactions were included and (2) the variable selection criterion used (AIC or BIC). Resulting models were then applied to historic weather patterns to illustrate inferred deployment zones for three seed sources. The projected performance generally agreed with the current consensus on loblolly pine seed movement guidelines. The models developed here can be readily implemented in a Decision Support System as they (1) suggest sets of adapted loblolly pine families from which foresters can choose based on local knowledge, (2) can be easily expanded to include other variables, and (3) can be applied to outputs from projected climate scenarios to extrapolate into the future. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Assisted migration; Categorical Universal Response Function; Climate change; Pinus taeda; Seed deployment; Universal Response Function","Agresti, A., (2007) An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis, , John Wiley and Sons Inc., Hoboken, NJ; Aitken, S.N., Yeaman, S., Holliday, J.A., Wang, T.L., Curtis-McLane, S., Adaptation, migration or extirpation: climate change outcomes for tree populations (2008) Evol.

With embedded systems being more and more intertwined and working together not only with each other, but also with their environments as cyber physical systems (CPSs), more streamlined development workflows are employed to handle the increasing complexity during a system’s design phase. SystemC is a C++ library for the design of hardware/software systems, enabling the designer to quickly prototype, e.g., a distributed CPS without having to decide about particular implementation details (such as whether to implement a feature in hardware or in software) early in the design process. Thereby, this approach reduces the initial implementation’s complexity by offering an abstract layer with which to build a working prototype. However, as SystemC is based on C++, analyzing designs becomes a difficult task due to the complex language features that are available to the designer. Several fundamentally different approaches for analyzing SystemC designs have been suggested. This work illustrates several different SystemC analysis approaches, including their specific advantages and shortcomings, allowing designers to pick the right tools to assist them with a specific problem during the design of a system using SystemC. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Analysis; AOP; ESL; Hardware/software co-design; Machine learning; Parsers; SystemC","Grosse, D., Drechsler, R., (2010) Quality-Driven Systemc Design, , Springer: New York, NY, USA; Marquet, K., Moy, M., Karkare, B.A., Theoretical and Experimental Review of SystemC Front-Ends (2010) Proceedings of the Forum on Specification and Design Languages (FDL), Southampton, pp. 124-129. , UK, 14–16 September; Fey, G., Große, D., Cassens, T., Genz, C., Warode, T., Drechsler, R., ParSyC: An Efficient SystemC Parser (2004) Proceedings of Theworkshop on Synthesis and System Integration of Mixed Information Technologies (SASIMI), pp. 148-154. , Kanazawa, Japan, 18–19 October; Parr, T.J., Dietz, H.G., Cohen, W., (1990) Purdue Compiler-Construction Tool Set, , Purdue University, School of Electrical Engineering: West Lafayette, IN, USA; Parr, T.J., Quong, R.W., ANTLR: A predicated-LL (k) parser generator (1995) Softw.

A Decision Support System (DSS) can help to optimize effective use of the scarce human resources available. In this paper we present a DSS that merges predictive policing capabilities with a patrolling districting model, for the design of predictive patrolling areas. The proposed DSS, developed in close collaboration with the Spanish National Police Corps (SNPC), defines partitions of the territory under the jurisdiction of a district that are efficient and balanced at the same time, according to the preferences of a decision maker. To analyze the crime records provided by the SNPC, a methodology for the description of spatially and temporally indeterminate crime events has been developed. The DSS has been tested with a case study in the Central District of Madrid. The results of the experiments show that the proposed DSS clearly outperforms the patrolling area definitions currently in use by the SNPC. To compare the solutions in terms of efficiency loss, we discuss how to build an operational envelope for the problem considered, which can be used to identify the range of performances associated with different patrolling strategies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Decision Support Systems; Multi-criteria decision-making; Police Districting Problem; Predictive policing; Time series forecasting","Benveniste, R., Solving the combined zoning and location problem for several emergency units (1985) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 36 (5), pp. 0433-0450; Bivand, R., Lewin-Koh, N., (2014) Maptools: Tools for Reading and Handling Spatial Objects, , http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=maptools, R package version 0.8-29; Bivand, R., Rundel, C., (2014) Rgeos: Interface to Geometry Engine-Open Source (GEOS), , http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgeos, R package version 0.3-4; Bivand, R.S., Pebesma, E., Gomez-Rubio, V., (2013) Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R, , http://www.asdar-book.org/, Second edition Springer-Verlag; Block, R.L., Block, C.R., (1995) Crime and Place, chapter ""Space, Place and Crime: Hot Spot Areas and Hot Places of Liquor-Related Crime"", pp. 145-183. , Criminal Justice Press/Willow Tree Press; Bodily, S., Police sector design incorporating preferences of interest groups for equality and efficiency (1978) Management Science, 24 (12), p. 01301; Brantingham, P.J., Brantingham, P., (1984) Patterns in Crime, , Prentice-Hall; Bursik, R.J., Grasmick, H.G., (1993) Neighborhoods and Crime: The Dimensions of Effective Community Control, , Lexington Books; Camacho-Collados, M., Liberatore, F., Angulo, J.M., A multi-criteria police districting problem for the efficient and effective design of patrol sector (2015) European Journal of Operations Research; Caplan, J.M., Kennedy, L.W., (2011) Risk Terrain Modeling Compendium, , Rutgers Center on Public Security; Caplan, J.M., Kennedy, L.W., Miller, J., Risk terrain modeling: Brokering criminological theory and GIS methods for crime forecasting (2011) Justice Quarterly, 28 (2), pp. 0360-0381; Chaiken, J., Dormont, P., A patrol car allocation model: Background (1978) Management Science, 24 (12), pp. 01280-01290; Chaiken, J., Dormont, P., A patrol car allocation model: Capabilities and algorithms (1978) Management Science, 24 (12), pp. 01291-01300; Chaturapruek, S., Breslau, J., Yazdi, D., Kolokolnikov, T., McCalla, S.G., Crime modeling with Levy flights (2013) SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, 73 (4), pp. 01703-01720; Chen, P., Yuan, H., Li, D., Space-time analysis of burglary in Beijing (2013) Security Journal, 26 (1), pp. 1-15; Church, R.L., Scaparra, M.P., Analysis of facility systems reliability when subject to attack or a natural disaster (2007) Critical Infrastructure: Reliability and Vulnerability: Advances in Spatial Science, pp. 221-241. , A.T.

We study minimizing coherent risk measures under a norm equality constraint with the use of robust optimization formulation. Not only existing coherent risk measures but also a new coherent risk measure is investigated by setting a new uncertainty set. The norm equality constraint itself has a practical meaning or plays a role to prevent a meaningless solution, the zero vector, in the context of portfolio optimization or binary classification in machine learning, respectively. For such advantages, the convexity is sacrificed in the formulation. However, we show a condition for an input of our problem which guarantees that the nonconvex constraint is convexified without changing the optimality of the problem. If the input does not satisfy the condition, we propose to solve a mixed integer optimization problem by using the (Formula presented.) or (Formula presented.)-norm. The numerical experiments show that our approach has good performance for portfolio optimization and binary classification and also imply its flexibility of modelling that makes it possible to deal with various coherent risk measures. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Binary classification; Coherent risk measure minimization; Nonconvexity; Portfolio optimization; Robust optimization",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929095712

In directional or horizontal wellbores, such calculations are becoming more complicated due to the inclined wellbore sections, since gravitational force components are required to be considered properly. Even though there are numerous studies performed on pressure drop estimation for multiphase flow in inclined pipes, not as many studies have been conducted for multiphase flow in annular geometries with eccentricity. In this study, the frictional pressure losses are examined thoroughly for liquid-gas multiphase flow in horizontal eccentric annulus.Pressure drop measurements for different liquid and gas flow rates are recorded. Using the experimental data, a mechanistic model based on the modification of Lockhart and Martinelli [18] is developed. Additionally, 4 different computational intelligence techniques (nearest neighbor, regression trees, multilayer perceptron and Support Vector Machines - SVM) are modeled and developed for pressure drop estimation.The results indicate that both mechanistic model and computational intelligence techniques estimated the frictional pressure losses successfully for the given flow conditions, when compared with the experimental results. It is also noted that the computational intelligence techniques performed slightly better than the mechanistic model. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Horizontal annuli; Liquid-gas flow; Neural networks; Pressure drop; SVM; Underbalanced drilling","Alizadehdakhel, A., Rahimi, M., Sanjari, J., Alsairafi, A.A., CFD and artificial neural network modeling of two-phase flow pressure drop (2009) Int Commun Heat Mass Transfer, 36 (8), pp. 850-856; Barnea, D., A unified model for predicting flow pattern transitions for the whole range of pipe inclinations (1987) Int J Multiphase Flow, 13 (1), p. 1; Beggs, H.D., Brill, J.P., A study of two-phase flow in inclined pipes (1973) J Petrol Technol, p. 607. , Trans., AIME, 255; Bendiksen, K.H., Malnes, D., Moe, R., Nuland, S., The dynamic two-fluid model OLGA: theory and application (1991) SPE Prod Eng, 6, pp. 171-180; Belt, R., Djoric, B., Kalali, S., Duret, E., Larrey, D., Comparison of commercial multiphase flow simulators with experimental and field databases (2011) Presented at BHR Group's multiphase production technology conference in Cannes; Caetano, E.F., Shoham, O., Brill, J.P., Upward vertical two-phase flow through an annulus.

This study developed an evolutionary metaheuristic intelligence model for efficiently and accurately estimating reinforcement loads. The proposed model improves the prediction capability of the firefly algorithm (FA) by integrating intelligent components, namely, a chaotic map, an adaptive inertia weight, and a Lévy flight. The enhanced FA is then used to optimise the hyperparameters for a least squares support vector regression model. The proposed model was validated using a database of 15 wall case studies (94 data points in total) via a cross-validation algorithm. The method was then compared with conventional prediction methods in terms of the accuracy for predicting the reinforcement tensile loads of GRS structures. The cross-validation results demonstrated that the proposed model has a superior accuracy and mean absolute percentage errors lower than 10%. Moreover, a comparison with the baseline models and empirical methods indicate that the evolutionary metaheuristic intelligence model provides a significant improvement in terms of the root mean square errors (by 63.61-92.30%).

Thus, biological principles of organization should also be the principles underlying mental operations. Practopoiesis states that the key for achieving intelligence through adaptation is an arrangement in which mechanisms laying at a lower level of organization, by their operations and interaction with the environment, enable creation of mechanisms laying at a higher level of organization. When such an organizational advance of a system occurs, it is called a traverse. A case of traverse is when plasticity mechanisms (at a lower level of organization), by their operations, create a neural network anatomy (at a higher level of organization). Another case is the actual production of behavior by that network, whereby the mechanisms of neuronal activity operate to create motor actions. Practopoietic theory explains why the adaptability of a system increases with each increase in the number of traverses. With a larger number of traverses, a system can be relatively small and yet, produce a higher degree of adaptive/intelligent behavior than a system with a lower number of traverses. The present analyses indicate that the two well-known traverses - neural plasticity and neural activity - are not sufficient to explain human mental capabilities. At least one additional traverse is needed, which is named anapoiesis for its contribution in reconstructing knowledge e.g., from long-term memory into working memory. The conclusions bear implications for brain theory, the mind-body explanatory gap, and developments of artificial intelligence technologies. © 2015 The Authors.","Adaptive systems; Cybernetics; Intelligent behavior; Neurophysiology","Abraham, W.C., Bear, M.F., Metaplasticity: the plasticity of synaptic plasticity (1996) Trends Neurosci., 19 (4), pp. 126-130; Ahima, R.S., Flier, J.S., Adipose tissue as an endocrine organ (2000) Trends Endocrinol.

The big push in recent years has been on the design of universal learning machines using optimization methods linear in the parameters, such as the Echo State Network, the Extreme Learning Machine and the Kernel Adaptive filter. We call this class of learning machines convex universal learning machines or CULMs. The purpose of the paper is to compare the methods behind these CULMs, highlighting their features using concepts of vector spaces (i.e. basis functions and projections), which are easy to understand by the computational intelligence community. We illustrate how two of the CULMs behave in a simple example, and we conclude that indeed it is practical to create universal mappers with convex adaptation, which is an improvement over backpropagation. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",,"Principe, J., Euliano, N., Lefebvre, C., (2000) Neural and Adaptive Systems: Fundamentals Through Simulations, , Hoboken, NJ: Wiley; Bishop, C.M., (1995) Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition, , New York: Oxford Univ.

Most of this activity has been performed using medium to low resolution imagery. There are only a few studies using highspatial resolutionimagery and machine learning image classification algorithms for mapping heterogeneouswetland plantcommunities. This study addresses this void by analyzing whether machine learning classifierssuch as decisiontrees (DT) and artificial neural networks (ANN) can accurately classify graminoid/sedgecommunities usinghigh resolution aerial imagery and image texture data in the Everglades National Park, Florida.In addition tospectral bands, the normalized difference vegetation index, and first- and second-order texturefeatures derivedfrom the near-infrared band were analyzed. Classifier accuracies were assessed using confusiontablesand the calculated kappa coefficients of the resulting maps. The results indicated that an ANN(multilayerperceptron based on backpropagation) algorithm produced a statistically significantly higheraccuracy(82.04 %) than the DT (QUEST) algorithm (80.48 %) or the maximum likelihood (80.56 %)classifier (α<0.05). Findings show that using multiple window sizes provided the best results. First-ordertexture featuresalso provided computational advantages and results that were not significantly different fromthose usingsecond-order texture features. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Plant communities; Remote sensing; Very high resolution imagery; Wetland","Armentano, T.V., Sah, J.P., Ross, M.S., Jones, D.T., Cooley, H.C., Smith, C.S., Rapid responses of vegetation to hydrological changes in Taylor Slough, Everglades National Park, Florida, USA (2006) Hydrobiologia, 569 (1), pp. 293-309; Ashish, D., McClendon, R.W., Hoogenboom, G., Land-use classification of multispectral aerial images using artificial neural networks (2009) International Journal of Remote Sensing, 30 (8), pp. 1989-2004; Baker, C., Lawrence, R., Montagne, C., Patten, D., Mapping wetlands and riparian areas using Landsat ETM+ imagery and decision-tree-based models (2006) Wetlands, 26 (2), pp. 465-474; Barbosa, I., Mapping wetland environments in the Brazilian Savannah from high resolution IKONOS image data.

Individuals and small organizations can benefit from using state-of-the-art services and infrastructure, while large companies are attracted by the flexibility and the speed with which they can obtain the services. Service providers compete to offer the most attractive conditions at the lowest prices. However, the environmental impact and legal aspects of cloud solutions pose additional challenges. Indeed, the new cloud-related techniques for resource virtualization and sharing and the corresponding service level agreements call for new optimization models and solutions.

Occasionally, only few records that indicate defective units are available and they are classified as a minority group in a large database. Such a situation leads to an imbalanced data set problem, wherein it engenders a great challenge to deal with by applying machine-learning techniques for obtaining effective solution. In addition, the database may comprise overlapping samples of different classes. This paper introduces two models of evolutionary fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) neural networks to deal with the imbalanced data set problems in a semiconductor manufacturing operations. In particular, both the FAM models and hybrid genetic algorithms are integrated in the proposed evolutionary artificial neural networks (EANNs) to classify an imbalanced data set. In addition, one of the proposed EANNs incorporates a facility to learn overlapping samples of different classes from the imbalanced data environment. The classification results of the proposed evolutionary FAM neural networks are presented, compared, and analyzed using several classification metrics. The outcomes positively indicate the effectiveness of the proposed networks in handling classification problems with imbalanced data sets. © 2012 IEEE.","Hybrid genetic algorithms (GAs) imbalanced data classification; supervised adaptive resonance theory (ART) neural networks; wafer defect detection","Kumar, N., Kennedy, K., Gildersleeve, K., Abelson, R., Mastrangelo, C.M., Montgomery, D.C., A review of yield modelling techniques for semiconductor manufacturing (2006) Int.

The proposed system, which runs on a smartphone, keeps the simplicity of a standard bolus calculator while enhancing its performance by providing more adaptability and flexibility. This is achieved by means of applying a retrospective optimization of the insulin bolus therapy using a novel combination of run-to-run (R2R) that uses intermittent continuous glucose monitoring data, and case-based reasoning (CBR). The validity of the proposed approach has been proven by in-silico studies using the FDA-accepted UVa-Padova type 1 diabetes simulator. Tests under more realistic in-silico scenarios are achieved by updating the simulator to emulate intrasubject insulin sensitivity variations and uncertainty in the capillarity measurements and carbohydrate intake. The CBR(R2R) algorithm performed well in simulations by significantly reducing the mean blood glucose, increasing the time in euglycemia and completely eliminating hypoglycaemia. Finally, compared to an R2R stand-alone version of the algorithm, the CBR(R2R) algorithm performed better in both adults and adolescent populations, proving the benefit of the utilization of CBR. In particular, the mean blood glucose improved from 166 ± 39 to 150 ± 16 in the adult populations (p = 0.03) and from 167 ± 25 to 162 ± 23 in the adolescent population (p = 0.06). In addition, CBR(R2R) was able to completely eliminate hypoglycaemia, while the R2R alone was not able to do it in the adolescent population. 2168-2194 © 2014 IEEE.

Specifically, necessary and sufficient conditions for equivalent, control-theoretic characterizations of the proposed balanced coordinated resource allocation design problem are derived, which are based on a new notion of semiobservability and a new semistable Lyapunov equation. With this theory, we first unveil a striking connection between the balanced coordinated network resource allocation design problem and optimal semistable control theory by means of a stochastic optimal semistable control technique. Then we convert this optimal control-based design problem into a constrained, nonlinear optimization problem to look for possible numerical solutions to the original balanced coordinated resource allocation algorithm design problem. To this end, we propose a class of randomized swarm optimization-based numerical algorithms called multiagent coordination optimization to solve the constrained, nonlinear optimization problem. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate the proposed design framework and an application of a target search problem for threat detection and resource allocation is presented to further show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2013 IEEE.","Compartmental models; load balancing; multiagent coordination; network systems; nonconvex optimization; numerical optimization; optimal control; resource allocation; semistability; swarm intelligence; task assignment","Committee on network science for future army applications (2005) Network Science., , National Research CouncilWashington, DC, USA: Nat.

These methods however have to rely on very complex, power hungry algorithms, implemented on the system backend, in order to achieve acceptable levels of accuracy. In size, and therefore power-constrained EEG systems, an alternative approach to the problem of data reduction is online data selection, in which simpler algorithms select potential epileptiform activity for discontinuous recording but accurate analysis is still left to a medical practitioner. Such a diagnostic decision support system would still provide doctors with information relevant for diagnosis while reducing the time taken to analyze the EEG. For wearable systems with limited power budgets, data selection algorithm must be of sufficiently low complexity in order to reduce the amount of data transmitted and the overall power consumption. In this paper, we present a low-power hardware implementation of an online epileptic seizure data selection algorithm with encryption and data transmission and demonstrate the tradeoffs between its accuracy and the overall system power consumption. We demonstrate that overall power savings by data selection can be achieved by transmitting less than 40% of the data. We also show a 29% power reduction when selecting and transmitting 94% of all seizure events and only 10% of background EEG. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Sisodiya, S., Etiology and management of refractory epilepsies (2007) Nat.

The input noisy distance measurements are first embedded by Diffusion embedding and then by Isomap. This allows to better estimate the intrinsic network geometry and derive improved adaptive bases, that are used to estimate the global localization via $L<inf>1</inf> regression. We then introduce the Augmented Dual Embedding by computationally augmenting the set of measured distances and computing the dual embedding. This significantly improves the scheme's robustness and accuracy. We also propose a straightforward approach to preprocessing the noisy distances via the triangle inequality.

We consider the optimality of ranking algorithms through minimization of the theoretical risk which combines pairwise ranking errors of ordinal categories with differential ranking costs. The extension shows that for a certain class of convex loss functions including exponential loss, the optimal ranking function can be represented as a ratio of weighted conditional probability of upper categories to lower categories, where the weights are given by the misranking costs. This result also bridges traditional ranking methods such as proportional odds model in statistics with various ranking algorithms in machine learning. Further, the analysis of multipartite ranking with different costs provides a new perspective on non-smooth listwise ranking measures such as the discounted cumulative gain and preference learning.

In learning to rank, the performance of a ranking model is strongly affected by the number of labeled examples in the training set; on the other hand, obtaining labeled examples for training data is very expensive and time-consuming. This presents a great need for the active learning approaches to select most informative examples for ranking learning; however, in the literature there is still very limited work to address active learning for ranking. In this paper, we propose a general active learning framework, expected loss optimization (ELO), for ranking. The ELO framework is applicable to a wide range of ranking functions. Under this framework, we derive a novel algorithm, expected discounted cumulative gain (DCG) loss optimization (ELO-DCG), to select most informative examples. Then, we investigate both query and document level active learning for raking and propose a two-stage ELO-DCG algorithm which incorporate both query and document selection into active learning. Furthermore, we show that it is flexible for the algorithm to deal with the skewed grade distribution problem with the modification of the loss function. Extensive experiments on real-world web search data sets have demonstrated great potential and effectiveness of the proposed framework and algorithms. © 2014 IEEE.","Active Learning; Expected Loss Optimization; Ranking","Abe, N., Mamitsuka, H., Query learning strategies using boosting and bagging (1998) Proc. 15th Int.

However, the generation of this kind of teaching material implies serious difficulties, mainly in terms of coding efforts. This work describes how to use an authoring tool, Easy Java Simulations, to build interactive simulations using FreeFem++ (Hecht F 2012 J. Numer. Math. 20 251) as a PDE solver engine. It makes possible to build simulations where students can change parameters, the geometry and the equations themselves getting an immediate feedback. But it is also possible for them to edit the simulations to set deeper changes. The process is ilustrated with some basic examples. These simulations show PDEs in a pedagogic manner and can be tuned by no experts in the field, teachers or students.

In this paper, we therefore extend a successful previous neural network model of learning multisensory integration in the superior colliculus (SC) by top-down, attentional input and train it on different classes of cross-modal stimuli. The network not only learns to integrate cross-modal stimuli, but the model also reproduces neurons specializing in different combinations of modalities as well as behavioral and neurophysiological phenomena associated with spatial and feature-based attention. Importantly, we do not provide the model with any information about which input neurons are sensory and which are attentional. If the basic mechanisms of our model-self-organized learning of input statistics and divisive normalization-play a major role in the ontogenesis of the SC, then this work shows that these mechanisms suffice to explain a wide range of aspects both of bottom-up multisensory integration and the top-down influence on multisensory integration. © 2015 The Authors.","Attention; Multisensory integration; Self-organization; Superior colliculus","Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 19 (6), pp. 716-723; Alais, D., Burr, D., The ventriloquist effect results from near-optimal bimodal integration (2004) Current Biology, 14 (3), pp. 257-262; Anastasio, T., Patton, P., A two-stage unsupervised learning algorithm reproduces multisensory enhancement in a neural network model of the corticotectal system (2003) The Journal of Neuroscience, 23 (17), pp. 6713-6727; Andersen, S.K., Müller, M., Hillyard, S.A., Color-selective attention need not be mediated by spatial attention (2009) Journal of Vision, 9 (6); Bauer, J., Wermter, S., Learning multi-sensory integration with self-organization and statistics (2013), pp. 7-12. , In Artur Garcez, Luis Lamb, and Pascal Hitzler (Eds.), Ninth international workshop on neural-symbolic learning and reasoning NeSy'13, AugustBauer, J., Wermter, S., Self-organized neural learning of statistical inference from high-dimensional data (2013), pp. 1226-1232. , In F.Rossi, (Ed.), International joint conference on artificial intelligence IJCAI, AugustBauer, J., Dávila-Chacón, J., Wermter, S., Modeling development of natural multi-sensory integration using neural self-organisation and probabilistic population codes (2014) Connection Science, pp. 1-19; Beck, J., Ma, W., Kiani, R., Hanks, T., Churchland, A., Roitman, J., Shadlen, M., Pouget, A., Probabilistic population codes for Bayesian decision making (2008) Neuron, 60 (6), pp. 1142-1152; Berson, D., Retinal and cortical inputs to cat superior colliculus: composition, convergence and laminar specificity (1988) Progress in brain research, 75, pp. 17-26. , Elsevier; Born, S., Ansorge, U., Kerzel, D., Feature-based effects in the coupling between attention and saccades (2012) Journal of Vision, 12 (11); Bruce, C., Goldberg, M., Bushnell, M., Stanton, G., Primate frontal eye fields.

For ensemble learning, differences among the output graphs provide the required base classifier diversity and lead to improved performance in the increasing size of the ensemble. We study different methods of forming the ensemble prediction, including majority voting and two methods that perform inferences over the graph structures before or after combining the base models into the ensemble. We put forward a theoretical explanation of the behaviour of multilabel ensembles in terms of the diversity and coherence of microlabel predictions, generalizing previous work on single target ensembles. We compare our methods on a set of heterogeneous multilabel benchmark problems against the state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, including multilabel AdaBoost, convex multitask feature learning, as well as single target learning approaches represented by Bagging and SVM. In our experiments, the random graph ensembles are very competitive and robust, ranking first or second on most of the datasets. Overall, our results show that our proposed random graph ensembles are viable alternatives to flat multilabel and multitask learners. © 2014, The Author(s).","Ensemble methods; Graphical models; Kernel methods; Multilabel classification; Structured output","Argyriou, A., Evgeniou, T., Pontil, M., Convex multi-task feature learning (2008) Machine Learning, 73 (3), pp. 243-272; Bian, W., Xie, B., Tao, D., Corrlog: Correlated logistic models for joint prediction of multiple labels (2012) Proceedings of the Fifteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS-12), 22, pp. 109-117; Breiman, L., Bagging predictors (1996) Machine Learning, 24, pp. 123-140; Brown, G., Kuncheva, L.I., Good and bad diversity in majority vote ensembles (2010) Multiple classifier systems, pp. 124-133. , Berlin: Springer; Cristianini, N., Shawe-Taylor, J., (2000) An introduction to support vector machines and other kernel-based learning methods (1st ed.), , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Demšar, J., Statistical comparisons of classifiers over multiple data sets (2006) The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 7, 30p; Dunn, O.J., Multiple comparisons among means (1961) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 56 (293), pp. 52-64; Esuli, A., Fagni, T., Sebastiani, F., Boosting multi-label hierarchical text categorization (2008) Information Retrieval, 11 (4), pp. 287-313; Freund, Y., Schapire, R.E., A decision-theoretic generalization of on-line learning and an application to boosting (1997) Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 55 (1), pp. 119-139; Friedman, M., The use of ranks to avoid the assumption of normality implicit in the analysis of variance (1937) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 32 (200), pp. 675-701; Krogh, A., Vedelsby, J., Neural network ensembles, cross validation, and active learning (1995) Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 231-238. , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Rajaraman, A., Ullman, J., (2011) Mining of massive datasets, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Ralaivola, L., Swamidass, S., Saigo, H., Baldi, P., Graph kernels for chemical informatics (2005) Neural Networks, 18, pp. 1093-1110; Rousu, J., Saunders, C., Szedmak, S., Shawe-Taylor, J., Kernel-based learning of hierarchical multilabel classification models (2006) The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 7, pp. 1601-1626; Rousu, J., Saunders, C., Szedmak, S., Shawe-Taylor, J., Efficient algorithms for max-margin structured classification (2007) In Predicting structured data, pp. 105-129; Schapire, R., Singer, Y., Improved boosting algorithms using confidence-rated predictions (1998) Proceedings of the Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory, pp. 80-91. , New York: ACM Press; Schapire, R.E., Singer, Y., Boostexter: A boosting-based system for text categorization (2000) Machine Learning, 39 (2-3), pp. 135-168; Schölkopf, B., Smola, A., (2001) Learning with Kernels, , MIT Press, Cambridge, MA; Su, H., Rousu, J., Multi-task drug bioactivity classification with graph labeling ensembles.

This variation especially hampers the application of otherwise successful supervised-learning techniques which, in order to perform well, often require a large amount of labeled training data that is exactly representative of the target data. We therefore propose to use transfer learning for image segmentation. Transfer-learning techniques can cope with differences in distributions between training and target data, and therefore may improve performance over supervised learning for segmentation across scanners and scan protocols. We present four transfer classifiers that can train a classification scheme with only a small amount of representative training data, in addition to a larger amount of other training data with slightly different characteristics. The performance of the four transfer classifiers was compared to that of standard supervised classification on two magnetic resonance imaging brain-segmentation tasks with multi-site data: white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid segmentation; and white-matter-/MS-lesion segmentation. The experiments showed that when there is only a small amount of representative training data available, transfer learning can greatly outperform common supervised-learning approaches, minimizing classification errors by up to 60%. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Image Segmentation; machine learning; magnetic resonance imaging; pattern recognition; Transfer learning","Anbeek, P., Probabilistic segmentation of brain tissue in MR imaging (2005) Neuroimage, 27 (4), p. 795; Anbeek, P., Vincken, K.L., Van Osch, M.J.P., Bisschops, R.H.C., Grond Der J.Van, Automatic segmentation of different-sized white matter lesions by voxel probability estimation (2004) Med.

Some works conducted over the last years have pointed out that such algorithms are generally susceptible to deception, notably in the form of attacks carefully constructed to evade detection. Various learning schemes have been proposed to overcome this weakness. One such system is Keyed IDS (KIDS), introduced at DIMVA '10. KIDS' core idea is akin to the functioning of some cryptographic primitives, namely to introduce a secret element (the key) into the scheme so that some operations are infeasible without knowing it. In KIDS the learned model and the computation of the anomaly score are both key-dependent, a fact which presumably prevents an attacker from creating evasion attacks. In this work we show that recovering the key is extremely simple provided that the attacker can interact with KIDS and get feedback about probing requests. We present realistic attacks for two different adversarial settings and show that recovering the key requires only a small amount of queries, which indicates that KIDS does not meet the claimed security properties. We finally revisit KIDS' central idea and provide heuristic arguments about its suitability and limitations. © 2015 IEEE.","Adversarial classification; anomaly detection; intrusion detection systems; secure machine learning","Barreno, M., Nelson, B., Sears, R., Joseph, A.D., Tygar, J.D., Can machine learning be secure?

They are based on full initial ratings in a user-item matrix. However, most of the time in group recommender systems, this matrix is sparse and users' preferences are unknown. This deficiency may make memory-based collaborative filtering unsuitable for group recommender systems. This paper, improves memory-based techniques for group recommendation systems by resolving the data sparsity problem. The core of the proposed method is based on a support vector machine learning model that computes similarities between items. This method employs calculated similarities and enhances basic memory-based techniques. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method overcomes the memory-based techniques. It also indicates that the presented work outperforms the latent factor approach, which is very efficient in sparse conditions. Finally, it is indicated that the proposed method gives a better performance than existing approaches on generating group recommendations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Collaborative filtering technique; Group recommendation system; Item-based approach; Sparsity problem; User-based approach","Al-Shamri, M.Y.H., Power coefficient as a similarity measure for memory-based collaborative recommender systems (2014) Expert Systems with Applications, 41 (13), pp. 5680-5688; Amer-Yahia, S., Roy, S.B., Chawlat, A., Das, G., Yu, C., Group recommendation: Semantics and efficiency (2009) Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 2 (1), pp. 754-765; Ardissono, L., Goy, A., Petrone, G., Segnan, M., Torasso, P., Intrigue: Personalized recommendation of tourist attractions for desktop and hand held devices (2003) Applied Artificial Intelligence, 17 (89), pp. 687-714; Baltrunas, L., Makcinskas, T., Ricci, F., Group recommendations with rank aggregation and collaborative filtering (2010) The Proceedings of the Fourth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems; Bell, R., Koren, Y., Volinsky, C., Modeling Relationships at Multiple Scales to Improve Accuracy of Large Recommender Systems (2007) The Proceedings of the 13th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining; Berkovsky, S., Freyne, J., Group-based recipe recommendations: Analysis of data aggregation strategies (2010) The Proceedings of the Fourth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems; Billsus, D., Pazzani M. ., J., Learning collaborative information filters (1998) The Proceedings of the Fifteenth International Conference on Machine Learning; Breese J. ., S., Heckerman, D., Kadie, C., Empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering (1998) The Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, , Madison, Wisconsin; Chao D. ., L., Balthrop, J., Forrest, S., Adaptive radio: Achieving consensus using negative preferences (2005) Proceedings of the 2005 International ACM SIGGROUP Conference on Supporting Group Work; Chee, S., Han, J., Wang, K., RecTree: An Efficient Collaborative Filtering Method (2001) Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery, 2114, pp. 141-151. , Y.

Wafer defects are a serious problem that could cause massive losses to the companies' yield. The defects occur as a result of a lengthy and complex fabrication process involving hundreds of stages, and they can create unique patterns. If these patterns were to be identified and classified correctly, then the root of the fabrication problem can be recognized and eventually resolved. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely accepted and are well suited for such classification-/identification problems. However, none of the existing ML model's performance exceeds 96% in identification accuracy for such tasks. In this paper, we develop a state-of-the-art classifying algorithm using multiple ML techniques, relying on a general-regression-network-based consensus learning model along with a powerful randomization technique. We compare our proposed method with the widely used ML models in terms of model accuracy, stability, and time complexity. Our method has proved to be more accurate and stable as compared to any of the existing algorithms reported in the literature, achieving its accuracy of 99.8%, stability of 1.128, and TBM of 15.8 s. © 2015 IEEE.","ensembles; machinelearning; neural-networks; randomization; Semiconductor wafer defect patterns","Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), (2014) February Semiconductor Sales Up 11.4 Percent Compared to Last Year, , http://www.semiconductors.org/news/201404/04/press_releases_2013/february_semiconductor_sales_up_11.4_percent_compared_to_last_year/, [Online].

A total of nine machine learning models are applied to perform classification of the medical data sets. A number of useful performance metrics which include accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, as well as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve are computed. In addition to the original data sets, noisy data sets are generated to evaluate the robustness of the classifiers against noise. The 10-fold cross validation method is used to compute the performance statistics, in order to ensure statistically reliable results pertaining to classification of the ECG and Korotkoff signals are produced. The outcomes indicate that while logistic regression models perform the best with the original data set, ensemble machine learning models achieve good accuracy rates with noisy data sets. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Among existing approaches to addressing this problem, the active learning (AL) and semisupervised learning (SSL) techniques have attracted much attention in recent years. AL usually involves a labor-intensive human-labeling process while SSL, although avoiding human labeling by assigning pseudolabels to unlabeled data, may introduce incorrect pseudolabels and thus deteriorate classification performance. To overcome these drawbacks, a novel approach named collaborative active and semisupervised learning (CASSL) is proposed in this paper. CASSL combines AL and SSL to invoke a collaborative labeling process by both human experts and classifiers. Specifically, an AL-based pseudolabel verification procedure is performed for gradually improving the pseudolabeling accuracy to facilitate SSL. Meanwhile, only those unlabeled data with low pseudolabeling confidence in SSL will become the query candidates in AL. We evaluate the performance of CASSL on three hyperspectral data sets and compare it with that of two state-of-the-art hyperspectral image classification methods. Experimental results reveal the superiority of CASSL. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Active learning (AL); hyperspectral image classification; remote sensing; semisupervised learning (SSL)","Neville, R., Staenz, K., Szeredi, T., Lefebvre, J., Hauff, P., Automatic endmember extraction from hyperspectral data for mineral exploration (1999) Proc. 21st Can.

However, because SWE varies significantly over space, the estimation of SWE at the catchment scale based on a single-point measurement is error-prone. We propose low-cost, lightweight methods for near-real-time estimation of mean catchment-wide SWE using existing infrastructure, wireless sensor networks, and machine learning algorithms. Because snowpack distribution is highly nonlinear, we focus on Genetic Programming (GP), a nonlinear, white-box, inductive machine learning algorithm. Because we did not have access to near-real-time catchment-scale SWE data, we used available data as ground truth for machine learning in a set of experiments that are successive approximations of our goal of catchment-wide SWE estimation. First, we used a history of maritime snowpack data collected by manual snow courses. Second, we used distributed snow depth (HS) data collected automatically by wireless sensor networks. We compared the performance of GP against linear regression (LR), binary regression trees (BT), and a widely used basic method (BM) that naively assumes non-variable snowpack. In the first experiment set, GP and LR models predicted SWE with lower error than BM. In the second experiment set, GP had lower error than LR, but outperformed BT only when we applied a technique that specifically mitigated the possibility of over-fitting. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Genetic programming; Machine learning; Snow water equivalent; Snowpack modeling; Wireless sensor network","Adams, W.P., Areal differentiation of snow cover in east central Ontario (1976) Water Resour.

Hence, early detection of MI events is critical for effective preventative therapies, potentially reducing avoidable mortality. One approach for early disease prediction is the use of risk prediction models developed using machine learning techniques. One important component of these models is to provide clinicians with the flexibility to customize (e.g., the prediction range) and use the risk prediction model that they deemed most beneficial for their patients. Therefore, in this paper, we develop MI prediction models and investigate the effect of sample age and prediction resolution on the performance of MI risk prediction models. The cardiovascular health study dataset was used in this study. Results indicate that the prediction model developed using SVM algorithm is capable of achieving high sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy of 95.3%, 84.8%, and 90.1%, respectively, over a time span of 6 years. Both sample age and prediction resolution were found not to have a significant impact on the performance of MI risk prediction models developed using subjects aged 65 and above. This implies that risk prediction models developed using different sample age and prediction resolution is a feasible approach. These models can be integrated into a computer aided screening tool which clinicians can use to interpret and predict the MI risk status of the individual patients after performing the necessary clinical assessments (e.g., cognitive function, physical function, electrocardiography, general changes to health/lifestyle, and medications) required by the models. This could offer a means for clinicians to screen the patients at risk of having MI in the near future and prescribe early medical intervention to reduce the risk. 2168-2194 © 2014 IEEE.

By applying fuzzy inference and nonlinear correlation measurement, the effects of the samples with low confidence can be reduced. Further, a new approach for determining the error interval of regression results is proposed to avoid the control system malfunction. Tests are carried out on modified COMS electric vehicles, with two battery packs each consists of 24 50 Ah LiFePO4 batteries. The effectiveness of the method is proven by the test and the comparison with other popular methods.","Electric vehicle; Lithium battery; Nonlinear correlation; State of charge; Support vector machine","Klass, V., Behm, M., Lindbergh, G., A support vector machine-based state-of-health estimation method for lithium-ion batteries under electric vehicle operation (2014) J.

Two main categories of PV modeling are available: the parametric and the nonparametric. In this paper, a methodology using a nonparametric PV model is proposed, using as inputs several forecasts of meteorological variables from a Numerical Weather Forecast model, and actual AC power measurements of PV plants. The methodology was built upon the R environment and uses Quantile Regression Forests as machine learning tool to forecast AC power with a confidence interval. Real data from five PV plants was used to validate the methodology, and results show that daily production is predicted with an absolute cvMBE lower than 1.3%. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Numerical Weather Prediction; PV plant; PV power forecast; Quantile Regression; Random Forest; Weather Research and Forecasting","Almeida, M.P., http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13348, Perpiñán, O., December 2014.

This study introduces a device annotation method that supports the consistent description of the functional attributes of cardiac devices and evaluates how this method can detect device changes from a CIED registry. We designed the Cardiac Device Ontology, an ontology of CIEDs and device functions. We annotated 146 cardiac devices with this ontology and used it to detect therapy changes with respect to atrioventricular pacing, cardiac resynchronization therapy, and defibrillation capability in a French national registry of patients with implants (STIDEFIX). We then analyzed a set of 6905 device replacements from the STIDEFIX registry. Ontology-based identification of therapy changes (upgraded, downgraded, or similar) was accurate (6905 cases) and performed better than straightforward analysis of the registry codes (F-measure 1.00 versus 0.75 to 0.97). This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of ontology-based functional annotation of devices in the cardiac domain. Such annotation allowed a better description and in-depth analysis of STIDEFIX. This method was useful for the automatic detection of therapy changes and may be reused for analyzing data from other device registries. © 2013 IEEE.","Biomedical informatics; decision support systems; information management; knowledge-based systems; pacemakers","Bardy, G.H., Lee, K.L., Mark, D.B., Poole, J.E., Packer, D.L., Boineau, R., Domanski, M., Ip, J.H., Amiodarone or an implantable cardioverterdefibrillator for congestive heart failure (2005) N.

TBL provides students with opportunities to not only learn course content better than in the traditional lecture-based setting, but also to develop various transferable professional skills, such as self-directed independent learning, problem solving, and interpersonal team skills. Because of these potential benefits, TBL was adapted as the principal teaching and learning strategy in a two-course sophomore-level electric circuit theory sequence, where it has been used since 2010. This paper describes beneficial changes that have evolved in the implementation of TBL in the circuit theory sequence. Those changes have been based, in part, on student evaluations of the strategy, which are described. Finally, instruments used to assess student learning in the TBL-taught courses are also described. They provide evaluation information that suggests the described revised version of TBL is an effective way to facilitate learning of both technical content and several professional skills in the sophomore-level electric circuit theory sequence. © 2014 IEEE.","Learning groups; student-centered active learning; teaching electric circuit theory; team-based learning","Prince, M.J., Does active learning work?

The proposed approach is based on the integration of three techniques: Case Base Reasoning, Choquet integral and ontology. It has the following advanced features: (1) user-oriented ontology is used as source of knowledge to extract pertinent information about stakeholder's preferences and needs; (2) semantic web rule language is considered to provide the system with enhanced semantic capabilities and support personalized case representation; (3) a CBR-personalized retrieval mechanism is designed to provide a user with an optimum itinerary that meets his personal needs and preferences. The above features lead to a personalized and optimum itinerary search that meets the user's needs as specified in their queries such as fuel consumption, environmental impact, optimum route, time management etc. This has the potential to effectively manage fright movement according to stakeholder's needs and alleviate congestion problems in urban areas. The proposed intelligent decision support system (Onto-CBR) is implemented to an itinerary search problem for freight transportation users in urban areas. Its performance is further compared to an itineraries search system that was proposed by the authors in an earlier publication. Both approaches are compared in terms of their ability to meet user's personal preferences and achieve accuracy in case retrieval. The experimental results showed the ability of the proposed system to improve the accuracy of case retrieval and reduce retrieval time prominently. The ability of the proposed system tailor the search to stakeholders needs, improve the accuracy of case retrieval and facilitate the search process are among the main positive features of the proposed intelligent decision support system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the production part, the batch-processing machines have fixed capacity and the jobs have arbitrary sizes and processing times. Jobs in a batch can be processed together, provided that the total size of the jobs in the batch does not exceed the machine capacity. The processing time of a batch is the largest processing time of all the jobs in the batch. In the distribution part, the vehicles have identical transport capacity and all the deliveries are done by a third-party logistic (3PL) provider. The objective is to minimize the total cost of production and distribution for the manufacturer. Since the problem is NP-hard in the strong sense, we propose an improved ant colony optimization method to solve the production part, and a heuristic method for the distribution part. We derive a lower bound for the optimal total cost. We generate a large number of random data to test the performance of the proposed heuristic versus the lower bound. Our results show that the performance of the heuristic is excellent while the running time is no more than five seconds for 200 jobs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
