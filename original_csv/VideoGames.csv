In a repeated measures experiment, seven experienced players played five popular dance exer-games on separate days. Exertion was measured using indirect calorimetry. Hedonic experience was measured using questions about engagement and game-flow. Platform and software usability was determined by questionnaire and percent time spent in non-play activities (menu interfaces, software loading). Mean MET levels ranged from 4.26 to 9.18 during gameplay, depending on the game. Player engagement and game-flow were closely related to MET activity. Usability scores were closely related to time spent in non-play activities. Games with increased MET levels and higher usability scores were reflected in higher engagement and game-flow scores. Degree of interface embodiment did not affect these outcomes. Based on these results, problems in usability are barriers to engagement. Designing games that provide a balance of challenge, immersion, and engagement is a difficult task. These results demonstrate the importance of examining players of varying skill levels in order to fully understand the interaction of physical exertion, platform usability and player engagement. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy expenditures; Engagement; Flow; MET; Usability; Video game","Ainsworth, B.E., Haskell, W.L., Herrmann, S.D., Meckes, N., Bassett, D.R., Tudor-Locke, C., 2011 Compendium of physical activities: A second update of codes and MET values (2011) Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 43 (8), pp. 1575-1581; Bailey, B.W., McInnis, K., Energy cost of exergaming: A comparison of the energy cost of 6 forms of exergaming (2011) Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, 165 (7), pp. 597-602; Baranowski, T., Baranowski, J., O'Connor, T., Lu, A.S., Thompson, D., Is enhanced physical activity possible using active videogames?

Previous research has focused mainly on behavior in massively multiplayer online role-playing games; therefore, in the current study we sought to extend on this research by examining the connections between personality traits and behaviors in video games more generally. Two hundred and nineteen university students completed measures of personality traits, psychopathic traits, and a questionnaire regarding frequency of different behaviors during video game play. A principal components analysis of the video game behavior questionnaire revealed four factors: Aggressing, Winning, Creating, and Helping. Each behavior subscale was significantly correlated with at least one personality trait. Men reported significantly more Aggressing, Winning, and Helping behavior than women. Controlling for participant sex, Aggressing was negatively correlated with Honesty-Humility, Helping was positively correlated with Agreeableness, and Creating was negatively correlated with Conscientiousness. Aggressing was also positively correlated with all psychopathic traits, while Winning and Creating were correlated with one psychopathic trait each. Frequency of playing video games online was positively correlated with the Aggressing, Winning, and Helping scales, but not with the Creating scale. The results of the current study provide support for previous research on personality and behavior in massively multiplayer online role-playing games. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Aggression; Massively multiplayer online role-playing games; Online; Personality; Psychopathy; Video games","Ashton, M.C., Lee, K., Empirical, theoretical, and practical advantages of the HEXACO model of personality structure (2007) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 11, pp. 150-166; Ashton, M.C., Lee, K., The HEXACO-60: A short measure of the major dimensions of personality (2009) Journal of Personality Assessment, 91, pp. 340-345; Ashton, M.C., Lee, K., De Vries, R.E., The HEXACO Honesty-Humility, Agreeableness, and Emotionality factors: A review of research and theory (2014) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 18, pp. 139-152; Ashton, M.C., Lee, K., Perugini, M., Szarota, P., De Vries, R.E., Di Blas, L., A six-factor structure of personality-descriptive adjectives: Solutions from psycholexical studies in seven languages (2004) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 86, pp. 356-366; Axelsson, A.-S., Regan, T., Playing online (2006) Playing Video Games: Motives, Responses, and Consequences, pp. 291-306. , P.

Compared to college students, few studies have directly examined the potential impact of violent video games on youth and current evidence is mixed. The current article attempts to address this with three studies examining violent game play in youth aged 12-18. In Study 1, youth were randomized to play closely matched action games with either violent or non-violent content. Youth were given the opportunity to act aggressively using an ice water task. Study 2 was a conceptual replication of Study 1, with slower narrative games rather than action games. Study 3 examined the issue in a correlational study of youth, contrasting exposure to violent video games in youth's personal lives to their exposure to violence in controversial books while controlling for other variables including family, peer and personality variables. None of the studies provided evidence for concerns linking video game violence to aggressive behaviors or reduced empathy in youth. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A general issue in exploiting such approach concerns the breadth of the population that can be reached by serious games. Indeed, serious games need to be actively played and this can restrict their user population, because there are people who have no experience with video games or do not like them or do not have the proper hardware to play them. Moreover, there are organizational contexts in which a non-interactive presentation is preferred because it can be given in a more convenient and less costly way with simple traditional media, i.e., printed materials, slides or videos. This paper deals with the possibility of generating and using a non-interactive version of the experience provided by serious games. First, we propose a serious game that simulates a mass emergency caused by a terror attack in a train station. To obtain design guidance, we explore psychological models that explain how people are motivated to protect themselves from danger. Then, we generate the non-interactive version of the terror attack simulation and we contrast it with the interactive version. Results of our study show that both versions of the simulation can provide positive outcomes in learning, risk severity perception and self-efficacy, but they differ in how much they affect user's threat appraisal and emotional response. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Emergency preparedness; Evaluation; Interactivity; Protection Motivation Theory; Serious games; Simulation","Andreassi, J.L., (2007) Psychophysiology, , 5th ed.

One relevant issue among the possible video game effects on behavior is related to violence and aggression tendencies. The debate on this topic is still open and highlights the importance of considering possible mediating factors, such as moral positioning (e.g., preferences for evil/good characters/choices in video games), empathy, and personality of video gamers. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between moral positioning of video gamers and personality traits, aggression tendencies, and social abilities. 224 players completed an online survey including ad hoc questions about their preferences for evil/good characters and choices in video games and several validated questionnaires to assess their dispositional traits. Results showed that gamers' preferences for playing evil characters were negatively associated with extraversion, agreeableness, and empathy. Aggression was only partially correlated with evil moral positioning; specifically, in terms of physical aggression. Moreover, evil moral positioning in video games did not predict aggressive tendencies, but partially predicted low levels of empathic ability in players. The findings are discussed with reference to a social conception of video game play and to possible implications for the educational context. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Aggression; Agreeableness; Empathy; Extraversion; Morality; Video game","Albiero, P., Ingoglia, S., Lo Coco, A., Contributo all'adattamento Italiano dell'Interpersonal Reactivity Index (2006) Testing-Psicometria-Metodologia, 13 (2); Anderson, C., Bushman, B.J., Effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: A meta-analytic review of the scientific literature (2001) Psychological Science: A Journal of the American Psychological Society/APS, 12, pp. 353-359; Anderson, C.A., Dill, K.E., Video games and aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behavior in the laboratory and in life (2000) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78, pp. 772-790; Anderson, C.A., Shibuya, A., Ihori, N., Swing, E.L., Bushman, B.J., Sakamoto, A., Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behavior in eastern and western countries: A meta-analytic review (2010) Psychological Bulletin, 136, pp. 151-173; Arsenio, W.F., Lemerise, E.A., Aggression and moral development: Integrating social information processing and moral domain models (2004) Child Development, 75, pp. 987-1002; Barnett, M.A., Vitaglione, G.D., Harper, K.K.G., Quackenbush, S.W., Steadman, L.A., Valdez, B.S., Late adolescents' experiences with and attitudes toward videogames (1997) Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 27, pp. 1316-1334; Bartholow, B.D., Bushman, B.J., Sestir, M.A., Chronic violent video game exposure and desensitization to violence: Behavioral and event-related brain potential data (2006) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 42, pp. 532-539; Bartholow, B.D., Sestir, M.A., Davis, E.B., Correlates and consequences of exposure to video game violence: Hostile personality, empathy, and aggressive behavior (2005) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31, pp. 1573-1586; Björkvist, K., Österman, K., Kaukiainen, A., Social intellicence-empathy = aggression?

We first review the concept of attention networks that link changes in orienting, alerting and executive control to brain networks. Network training through video games or computer exercises can improve aspects of attention. The extent of transfer beyond the trained task is a controversial issue. Mindfulness is a form of meditation that keeps attention focused on the current moment.

We adopt a micro-econometric approach and use household survey data from Cameroon. Our results show that young and educated individuals are more likely to use the Internet in Cameroon. The probability of using the Internet is also higher for male, as well as for English-speaking and computer savvy individuals. Moreover, Internet users are more likely to have family abroad. We also find that Internet usage patterns differ across gender, age and education. For instance, older generations are less likely to use the Internet as a leisure activity (video, game, music). College educated people are also more likely to go online to search information than to have entertainment usage. These results provide evidence of digital divide in the Internet access, but also in the usage patterns on the African continent in particular in African countries that are at the early stages of Internet diffusion. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Africa; Digital divide; Internet adoption; Internet usage","Akhtar, S., Song, S., The Internet in Africa: global forces, African challenges (1998) Afr Dev Rev, 10 (1), pp. 162-172; Andres, L., Cuberes, D., Diouf, M., Srebrisky, T., (2008) The diffusion of Internet: a cross-country analysis, , Clemson University.

In this paper, we propose Query-by-Gaming scheme for spatio-temporal querying that can benefit from gaming controller for building queries. By using Query-by-Gaming, we introduce our spatio-temporal querying and retrieval system named as GStar to interactively build subsequent spatio-temporal queries to determine if a state is directly reachable from current state and eventual spatio-temporal queries to know whether a spatial state is reachable from a current state. Queries are built using features of gaming controller by displaying the original video frames rather than on a graphical interface using a mouse or a keyboard. GStar has three main components: building the query, searching and retrieval of clips, and displaying query results. The queries are applied to an indexing structure called semantic sequence state graph (S3G) and results of the query are displayed dynamically to provide timely feedback to the user. Experimental results and user interface are provided for a tennis video database. Users define desired game state (player and ball position) using an interactive interface at multiple points in time and GStar automatically retrieves all rallies that contain both states. Finally, the user interface evaluation comparing gamepad-based interface and mouse interface for spatio-temporal querying has been studied. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Query-by-Gaming; Spatio-temporal databases; Spatio-temporal querying","Jain, V., Aygun, R., SMART: a grammar-based semantic video modeling and representation (2008) Proceedings of IEEE Southeastcon, pp. 247-251. , 3-6 April; Naik, M., Jain, V., Aygun, R.S., S3G: a semantic sequence state graph for indexing spatio-temporal data-a tennis video database application (2008) Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC), pp. 66-73; Erwig, M., Schneider, M., Spatio-temporal predicates (2002) IEEE Trans.

To examine this issue, dyads performed a video game in which they moved a dot to the target of their choice out of a set of targets. By having each participant control the dot movements in only one dimension (orthogonal to their partner) and by varying the target locations, participants took on different roles. By chance, they also could have congruent or incongruent intentions prior to the movements. In a decider-follower scenario, where one actor decided on the target, judgments of control and judgments of performance depended on whether a prior intention was instantiated, but not on actor role. This finding is consistent with we-mode processing. When participants had conflicting intentions that needed to be resolved online, both the dominant and the nondominant participant showed a marked reduction in the perceived quality of the performance. Thus, dynamic intention negotiation reduced we-mode processing and shifted it toward I-mode processing. The nondominant actor also reported a strongly reduced sense of control. Implications for theories on the sense of agency and for applied settings are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Joint action; Metacognition; Mixed linear models; Performance evaluation; Sense of agency","Babcock, L., Loewenstein, G., Explaining bargaining impasse: The role of self-serving biases (1997) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 11, pp. 109-126; Blakemore, S.J., Wolpert, D.M., Frith, C.D., Abnormalities in the awareness of action (2002) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 6 (6), pp. 237-242; Böckler, A., Knoblich, G., Sebanz, N., Effects of co-actor's focus of attention on task performance (2012) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 38 (6), pp. 1404-1415; Brainard, D.H., The Psychophysics Toolbox (1997) Spatial Vision, 10, pp. 433-436; Caruso, E.M., Epley, N., Bazerman, M.H., The costs and benefits of undoing egocentric responsibility assessments in groups (2006) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 91, pp. 857-871; David, N., Newen, A., Vogeley, K., The ''sense of agency'' and its underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms (2008) Consciousness and Cognition, 17, pp. 523-534; Dewey, J.A., Pacherie, E., Knnoblich, G., The phenomenology of controlling a moving object with another person (2014) Cognition, 132, pp. 383-397; Fisher, R.A., On the 'probable error' of a coefficient of correlation deduced from a small sample (1921) Metron, 1, pp. 3-32; Gallotti, M., Frith, C.D., Social cognition in the we-mode (2013) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 17 (4), pp. 160-165; Haggard, P., Conscious intention and motor cognition (2005) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 9 (6), pp. 290-295; Haggard, P., Tsakiris, M., The experience of agency (2009) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 18 (4), pp. 242-246; Knoblich, G., Kircher, T., Deceiving oneself about being in control: Conscious detection of changes in visuo-motor coupling (2004) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 30, pp. 657-666; Knoblich, G., Repp, B., Inferring agency from sound (2009) Cognition, 111, pp. 248-262; Kovács, A.M., Teglas, E., Endress, A.D., The social sense: Susceptibility to others' beliefs in human infants and adults (2010) Science, 330 (6012), pp. 1830-1834; Metcalfe, J., Greene, M.J., Metacognition of agency (2007) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 136, pp. 184-199; Obhi, S.S., Hall, P., Sense of agency and intentional binding in joint action (2011) Experimental Brain Research, 211, pp. 655-662; Obhi, S.S., Hall, P., Sense of agency in joint action: Influence of human and computer co-actors (2011) Experimental Brain Research, 211, pp. 663-670; Oldfield, R.C., The assessment and analysis of handedness: The Edinburgh inventory (1971) Neuropsychologia, 9, pp. 97-113; Pacherie, E., The phenomenology of action: A conceptual framework (2008) Cognition, 107, pp. 179-217; Pacherie, E., How does it feel to act together?

However, this has not yet been tested. To that end, we studied postural sway and VIMS induced by motion and still images. Method 15 Participants were exposed to motion- and still images in separate sessions. Motion images consisted of video clips taken from a first person shooter game. Still images consisted of stills taken every 10 s from these same clips. Before, during, and after exposure, VIMS was rated and postural sway was measured. Sway path length, standard deviation and short- and long-term scaling components of the centre of pressure were calculated as measures of postural sway. Results VIMS scores obtained during and after exposure to motion images were significantly higher compared to scores obtained before, and directly after exposure to still images. The sway path length, standard deviation in anteroposterior direction and short-term scaling components in mediolateral and anteroposterior direction increased significantly during exposure to motion and still images. Conclusion In this experiment motion- and still images caused different levels of VIMS, but comparable increases in postural sway. We assume VIMS was caused by a mismatch between visual and vestibular motion cues. The increase in sway during exposure to still images can be explained by visual effects present in still images. The lack of vection in the motion images may explain why sway was not larger when viewing these motion images as compared to viewing the still images. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The survey screened for the presence and characteristics of the main recognized substance and behavioral addictions (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, other drugs, gambling, compulsive shopping, intensive exercise, Internet and mobile phone overuse, intensive work involvement, and overeating) in a three-month period. Key aspects of addiction were measured for each reported behavior, including negative outcomes, emotional triggers (positive and negative emotional contexts), search for stimulation or pleasure, loss of control, and cognitive salience.Latent class analysis allowed us to identify three theoretically and clinically relevant subgroups of individuals. The first class groups problematic users, i.e., addiction-prone individuals. The second class groups at-risk users who frequently engage in potentially addictive behaviors to regulate emotional states (especially overinvolvement in common behaviors such as eating, working, or buying). The third class groups individuals who are not prone to addictive behaviors.The existence of different groups in the population sheds new light on the distinction between problematic and non-problematic addiction-like behaviors. © 2015 The Authors.

Twenty-two young female soccer players watched video clips of 3 vs. 3 small-sided games and, after occlusion, had to reproduce the positions of the players. Recall performance was measured by calculating the spatial error of the recalled player positions at the moment of occlusion and at consecutive 33. ms increments. We analyzed player positions relative to each other, by assessing geometric pattern features in terms of angles between players, and we transformed the data into real-world coordinates to exclude the effects of the 2D perspective in the video clips. The results showed that the participants anticipated the movements of the patterns. In real-world coordinates, the more experienced players anticipated the pattern further in advance than the less experienced players and demonstrated a higher search rate, a shorter fixation duration and a higher fixation order. The differences in recall accuracy between the defensive and offensive elements were not consistent across the methods of analysis and, therefore, we propose that perspective effects of the video clip should be taken into account in further research. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Anticipation; Expertise; Gaze behavior; Methods of analysis; Pattern recall","Abdel-Aziz, Y.I., Karara, H.M., Direct linear transformation from comparator coordinates into objects space coordinates in close-range photogrammetry (1971) Proceedings of the symposium on close-range photogrammetry, pp. 1-18. , Urbana, IL: American Society of Photogrammetry; Abernethy, B., Russell, D.G., The relationship between expertise and visual search strategy in a racquet sport (1987) Human Movement Science, 6, pp. 283-319; Allard, F., Graham, S., Paarsalu, M.E., Perception in sport: Basketball (1980) Journal of Sport Psychology, 2, pp. 14-21; Borgeaud, P., Abernethy, B., Skilled perception of volleyball defense (1987) Journal of Sport Psychology, 9, pp. 400-406; Chase, W.G., Simon, H.A., Perception in chess (1973) Cognitive Psychology, 4, pp. 55-81; De Groot, A.D., (1965) Thought and choice in chess, , Mouton, The Hague, The Netherlands; Didierjean, A., Marmèche, E., Anticipatory representation of visual basketball scenes by novice and expert players (2005) Visual Cognition, 7, pp. 149-158; Dokter, R., (1993) The Dutch vision on youth soccer, , Koninklijke Nederlandsche Voetbalbond, Zeist, Netherlands; Finke, R.A., Freyd, J.J., Shyi, G.C.-W., Implied velocity and acceleration induce transformations of visual memory (1986) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 115, pp. 175-188; Freyd, J.J., Finke, R.A., A velocity effect for representational momentum (1985) Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society, 23, pp. 443-446; Gorman, A.D., Abernethy, B., Farrow, D., Investigating the anticipatory nature of pattern perception in sport (2011) Memory & Cognition, 39, pp. 894-901; Gorman, A.D., Abernethy, B., Farrow, D., Classical pattern recall tests and the prospective nature of expert performance (2012) The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 65, pp. 1151-1160; Gorman, A.D., Abernethy, B., Farrow, D., The expert advantage in dynamic pattern recall persists across both attended and unattended display elements (2013) Attention, Perception & Psychophysics, 75, pp. 835-844; Gorman, A.D., Abernethy, B., Farrow, D., Is the relationship between pattern recall and decision-making influenced by anticipatory recall?

Eleven children (mean age 8.09 years) and ten adults participated in the study. Each participant played two digital games, Slap Stream and Kung Foo, from EyeToy Play software. Eye movements were recorded using Mobile Eye eyetracker. Eye-hand coordination strategies and the time when virtual object appeared, the gaze shifted to the object, the reach started, the gaze shifted away, and the reach ended were coded from the video. The latencies between these events were computed and compared between adults and children and between games. The fixation duration, number of fixations, and number of gaze points were also computed for each game's areas of interests. Results showed that (1) all participants used multiple eye-hand strategies while playing active video games with some strategies more than others; (2) the Kung Foo game (with one target appearing on the screen) and the Slap Stream game (with potentially multiple targets appearing on the screen) induced different latencies and gaze points between children and adults; and (3) children had longer latencies and shorter fixation durations than adults. The study thus provides in-depth understanding of different patterns of eye-hand coordination in relations to active video game playing. The significant differences in coordinative control strategies found between adults and children as well as between game types provide a basis for further research in both child development and game-based learning fields. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Although cloud gaming services are getting more and more popular recently, its performance is highly limited by the network bandwidth and latency. This work makes use of the unique characteristics of human visual system (HVS) of video game players to improve bandwidth efficiency. In this work, discussions about the characteristics of game players' HVS are conducted. The discussions can be further extended to all interactive video on demand systems. Then, some schemes of extracting region of interest and key frames from gaming videos are raised. Based on that, a Macro-block level rate control scheme is proposed based on region of interest and scene-change detection. The simulation results show that, under the same bandwidth constraint, the video quality of proposed method outperforms other methods. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The method was developed to analyze the video recordings of facial expressions depicted during a collaborative game played as a part of the Mars-500 experiment. In this experiment, six astronauts were isolated for 520 days in a space station to simulate a flight to Mars. Seven time-dependent components of facial expressions were extracted from the video recordings of the experiment. To interpret these dynamic components, we proposed a mathematical model of emotional events. Genetic programming was used to find the locations, types, and intensities of the emotional events as well as the way the recorded facial expressions represented reactions to them. By classification of different statistical properties of the data, we found that there are significant relations between the facial expressions of different crew members and a memory effect between the collective emotional states of the crew members. The model of emotional events was validated on previously unseen video recordings of the astronauts. We demonstrated that both genetic search and optimization of the parameters improve the accuracy of the proposed model. This method is a step toward automating the analysis of affective expressions in terms of the cognitive appraisal theory of emotion, which relies on the dependence of the expressed emotion on the causing event.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929224206

SON negativity, an early wave in the mismatch negativity latency range, has been proposed as a potential event-related potential (ERP) index of the automatic preattentive detection of SON. SON negativity is probably not a general measure of familiarity, as it is not elicited by the subject's parent's name. We further investigated the specificity of this response by testing whether it is elicited by a name to which subjects were strongly but only temporarily familiarized. Findings: Subjects performed a task to detect an arbitrary unfamiliar name for forty minutes. Then, that name was presented randomly and equiprobably with nine novel unfamiliar names while they played a video game and tried to ignore the sounds. SON negativity was not elicited, even when subjects spontaneously noticed hearing the familiarized name. Conclusions: The finding supports the notion that SON negativity represents a specific ERP measure of the early preattentive detection of SON, rather than a general measure of familiarity. © 2015 Tateuchi et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Attention; Event-related potentials; Familiarity; Orienting response; Self reference; The self",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929009064

Existing evidence suggests a possible route for attaining togetherness – interpersonal synchrony, the fine-grained sensory-motor coordination that promotes social connectedness. Here, we investigated the physiological characteristics of togetherness using a practice from theater and dance, the mirror game. Pairs of expert improvisers jointly improvised synchronized linear motion, while their motion tracks and cardiovascular activity were continuously monitored. Players also provided dynamic ratings of togetherness while watching video recordings of their games. We identified periods of togetherness using kinematic and subjective markers and assessed their physiological characteristics. The kinematic and the subjective measures of togetherness showed some agreement, with more extensive game periods being marked by the subjective than the kinematic one. Game rounds with high rates of togetherness were characterized by increased players’ cardiovascular activity, increased correlation of players’ heart rates (HRs), and increased motion intensity. By comparing motion segments with similar motion intensity, we showed that moments of togetherness in the mirror game were marked by increased players’ HRs, regardless of motion intensity. This pattern was robust for the subjectively defined periods of togetherness, while showing a marginal effect for the kinematically defined togetherness. Building upon similar findings in flow research we suggest that the observed increase of players’ HRs during togetherness periods in the mirror game might indicate the enhanced engagement and enjoyment reported by performers going into ‘the zone.’ The suggested approach, combining temporal measurements of kinematic, physiological and subjective responses, demonstrates how the dynamics of spontaneously emerging dyadic states can be studied empirically. © 2015 Noy, Levit-Binunand Golland.","Arousal; Dyadic physiology; Group flow; Interpersonal synchrony; Joint improvisation; Social coordination; Togetherness","Babiloni, F., Astolfi, L., Social neuroscience and hyperscanning techniques: Past, present and future (2012) Neurosci.

One of the challenges is maintaining the quality of service due to scarce resources in wireless communications and heavy loadings from heterogeneous demands. A promising solution is combining multicasting and scalable video coding (SVC) techniques via cross-layer design, which has been shown to effectively enhance the quality of multimedia content delivery service in the literature. Nevertheless, most existing works on SVC multicasting system focus on the static scenarios, where a snapshot of user demands is given and remains the same. In addition, the economic value of the SVC multicasting system, which is an important issue from the service provider's perspective, has seldom been explored. In this paper, we study a subscription-based SVC multicasting system with stochastic user arrival and heterogeneous user preferences. A stochastic framework based on the multidimensional Markov decision process (M-MDP) is proposed to study the negative network externality existing in the proposed system and theoretically evaluate the corresponding system efficiency. A game-theoretic analysis is conducted to understand the rational demands from heterogeneous users under different subscription pricing schemes. By transforming the original dynamic and complex M-MDP revenue optimization problem into a traditional average-reward MDP problem, we show that the optimal pricing strategy that maximizes the expected revenue of the service provider can be derived efficiently. Moreover, the overall user's valuation on the system, e.g., social welfare, is maximized under such an optimal pricing strategy. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed solutions is evaluated through simulations. © 2014 IEEE.

Unlike video streaming, which is one-way traffic, video chat features distributed two-way traffic relayed via base stations, where resource allocation of a client affects the video quality seen by its communicating partner. In this paper, we study the mechanism design of this application via dynamic pricing, and seek efficiency and fairness of resource utilization. Specifically, we assume that the base station relays video bitstreams and charges a service price on the clients based on the transmission power consumption. Based on the price and a given power budget, the clients allocate bitrate and power for video coding and transmission such that the service price and the distortion seen by their partners are minimized. We study such network dynamics in Stackelberg game-theoretic framework. To solve the problem, we propose a complexity-scalable video encoding method and a power-rate-distortion (PRD) model for video chat. The model is more accurate in describing the PRD characteristics, yet of lower complexity in online updates of its coefficients. Based on the PRD model, we derive the distributed rate and power allocations for the clients. We show that a simple pricing update in the base stations is sufficient for optimal pricing. The proposed algorithms are optimal and converge to the Stackelberg equilibrium. Existing SNR- and power-based pricing schemes could not ensure fairness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a hybrid pricing scheme that balances these conflicting criteria. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior performance of the proposed methods and solutions. © 1999-2012 IEEE.","Joint rate and power allocation; pricing mechanism; Stackelberg game; video coding; wireless video chat","Baliga, J., Ayre, R.W.A., Hinton, K., Tucker, R.S., Energy consumption in wired and wireless access networks (2011) IEEE Commun.

However, current P2P systems are suffering from ""free-riding"" due to the peers' selfish nature. In this paper, we propose a credit-based incentive mechanism to encourage peers to cooperate with each other in a heterogeneous network consisting of wired and wireless peers. The proposed mechanism can provide differentiated service to peers with different credits through biased resource allocation. A Stackelberg game is formulated to obtain the optimal pricing and purchasing strategies, which can jointly maximize the revenue of the uploader and the utilities of the downloaders. In particular, peers' heterogeneity and selfish nature are taken into consideration when designing the utility functions for theStackelberg game. It is shown that the proposed resource allocation scheme is effective in providing service differentiation for peers and stimulating them to make contribution to the P2P streaming system. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","credit-based incentive mechanism; Game thoery; heterogeneous networks; network optimization; peer-to-peer networks; Stackelberg game","Kang, X., Wu, Y., A game-theoretic approach for cooperation stimulation in peer-to-peer streaming networks Proc.

Approximately 33% of fire fighter injuries result from exposure to fire leading to the possibility of reducing these injuries through training fire fighters to make better decisions, particularly when under stress. Simulation (and virtual simulation in particular) offers a safe and cost-effective alternative to practice with real fire, offering entry level training to aid fire fighters to reach a specific competency level. With the ubiquity of video game play and advent of new consumer-level physical interfaces for video games (e.g., the Nintendo Wii Fit balance-board and the Microsoft Kinect), serious games (games whose primary purpose is education and training), are able to provide users with innovative interactive techniques that are highly engaging and immersive. This paper reviews the development of serious games and virtual simulation applications that may be utilized for training in the fire service. Current technology allows for the simulation of fire spread and smoke movement along with training certain fire fighting skills and incident command co-ordination. To date, gaming technology is not capable of providing a real world scenario that is completely and faithfully accurate in a dynamic virtual environment. Future work could utilize serious games to also recreate the decision making processes and the physical requirements that fire fighters encounter in an emergency situation. These could be incorporated into a simulation environment where the physical and psychological stresses are analogous to live fire fighting situations. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Consumer electronics; Fire fighting; Physiology; Training; Virtual reality","Austin, C.C., Dussault, G., Ecobichon, D.J., Municipal firefighter exposure groups, time spent at fires and use of self-contained-breathing-apparatus (2001) Am J Ind Med, 40 (6), pp. 683-692; Baker, S.J., Grice, J., Roby, L., Matthews, C., Cardiorespiratory and thermoregulatory response of working in fire-fighter protective clothing in a temperate environment (2000) Ergonomics, 43 (9), pp. 1350-1358; Duncan, H.W., Gardner, G.W., Barnard, R.J., Physiological responses of men working in fire fighting equipment in the heat (1979) Ergonomics, 22 (5), pp. 521-527; Lusa, S., Louhevaara, V., Kinnunen, K., Are the job demands on physical work capacity equal for young and aging firefighters?

In the World Wide Web, however, this is different: the representation of three-dimensional scenes in a browser is only a few years old and so far, shadows play at most a minor role. Still, shadows are an important factor in the human perception of three-dimensional worlds, since they increase in general not only the authenticity of a scene, but at the same time provide important clues about where an object is placed in space. The JavaScript-based open-source framework X3DOM plays an essential role in the 3D web development, because it provides an approach for the integration of declarative 3D in HTML5. However, it provides only rudimentary shadow techniques, which are insufficient to today's requirements. In this work, this problem is addressed by first examining existing shadow mapping techniques for their suitability for use in the web. Based on this we provide a concept to improve the shadow representation for X3DOM. We implemented and validated our concept showing the benefit.

The reviews are often ranked based on user helpfulness votes to minimize the review information overload problem. This paper examines the factors that contribute towards helpfulness of online reviews and builds a predictive model. The proposed predictive model extracts novel linguistic category features by analysing the textual content of reviews. In addition, the model makes use of review metadata, subjectivity and readability related features for helpfulness prediction. Our experimental analysis on two real-life review datasets reveals that a hybrid set of features deliver the best predictive accuracy. We also show that the proposed linguistic category features are better predictors of review helpfulness for experience goods such as books, music, and video games. The findings of this study can provide new insights to e-commerce retailers for better organization and ranking of online reviews and help customers in making better product choices. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This research tests and compares the prosocial effects of two of the most prototypical emotions on a range of prosocial intentions and behaviors. Emotion-inducing videos were used to instigate states of moral elevation (felt when witnessing a moral virtue) and/or moral outrage (felt when witnessing a moral transgression). Although elevation and outrage are derived from opposing appraisals, separate strands of research show that they both instigate a desire to help others. The current research tests the appraisal tendency framework to explore whether elevation and outrage increase prosociality across moral domains or whether their prosocial effects are domain specific. Results of Experiment 1 showed that elevation, but not outrage, increased donations to charity (i.e., benevolence domain). Experiment 2 showed that outrage, but not elevation, increased prosocial political action intentions (i.e., justice domain). Experiment 3 showed that outrage, but not elevation, increased compensation in a third-party bystander game (i.e., justice domain). This research shows that although elevation and outrage both inspire a desire to help others, they affect distinct types of prosocial behaviors, offering support for the appraisal tendency framework. Applied and theoretical implications are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Appraisal tendency framework; Elevation; Moral emotion; Outrage; Prosocial behavior","Abrams, D., Hogg, M.A., Social identity and self-categorization (2010) The Sage handbook of prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination, pp. 179-193. , Sage Publications, Los Angeles, J.F.

Methods: Two clinical, controlled and prospective studies were conducted, one with 19 nulliparous women without urinary symptoms, who were evaluated by both electromyography and digital palpation (DP) and another with 27 postmenopausal women with mixed urinary symptoms (assessed by both ICIQ UI-SF and ICIQ-OAB), evaluated by vaginal dynamometry and DP, with a total of 46 women in both studies. This protocol was designed so that the participant would play a video game, seated on a pressure base platform, while commanding it through her pelvic movements. Using a virtual reality game, five activities were performed during 30 min, twice a week, with a total of 10 sessions. Results: A significant increase in PFM strength was found in both the nulliparous (p = 0.0001) and the postmenopausal (p = 0.0001) groups of women, as ascertained by DP. A significant increase in postmenopausal women’s muscle strength and endurance assessed by dynamometry (p = 0.05) and a concomitant decrease in their urinary symptoms, were observed. Conclusion: This virtual reality program promoted an increase in PFM contractility and a decrease in postmenopausal urinary symptoms. © 2015 The International Urogynecological Association","Digital palpation; Electromyography; Muscle strength dynamometer; Pelvic floor; Urinary symptoms; Virtual reality exposure therapy",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928683991

A number of studies have attempted to evaluate media contents, especially TV commercials using various neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG). Yet neurophysiological examination of detailed cognitive and affective responses in viewers is still required to provide practical information to marketers. Here, this study develops a method to analyze temporal patterns of EEG data and extract affective and cognitive indices such as happiness, surprise, and attention for TV commercial evaluation. Methods: Twenty participants participated in the study. We developed the neurophysiological indices for TV commercial evaluation using classification model. Specifically, these model-based indices were customized using individual EEG features. We used a video game for developing the index of attention and four video clips for developing indices of happiness and surprise. Statistical processes including one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) and the cross validation scheme were used to select EEG features for each index. The EEG features were composed of the combinations of spectral power at selected channels from the cross validation for each individual. The Fisher's linear discriminant classifier (FLDA) was used to estimate each neurophysiological index during viewing four different TV commercials. Post hoc behavioral responses of preference, short-term memory, and recall were measured. Results: Behavioral results showed significant differences for all preference, short-term memory rates, and recall rates between commercials, leading to a 'high-ranked' commercial group and a 'low-ranked' group (P < 0.05). Neural estimation of happiness results revealed a significant difference between the high-ranked and the low-ranked commercials in happiness index (P < 0.01). The order of rankings based on happiness and attention matched well with the order of behavioral response rankings. In the elapsed-time analysis of the highest-ranked commercial, we could point to visual and auditory semantic structures of the commercial that induced increases in the happiness index. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that the neurophysiological indices developed in this study may provide a useful tool for evaluating TV commercials. © Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Advertising; Electroencephalography (EEG); Neurophysiological indices; TV commercials","Perrachione, T.K., Perrachione, J.R., Brains and brands: developing mutually informative research in neuroscience and marketing (2008) J Consum Behav., 7, pp. 303-318; Morin, C., Neuromarketing: the new science of consumer behavior (2011) Society., 48, pp. 131-135; Madan, C.R., Neuromarketing: the next step in market research?

As autonomous agents, peers cooperate only when they are incentivized to do so. Typically, incentives are provided through bilateral exchange of useful data, in a tit-for-tat manner. Unfortunately, good for file sharing and video-on-demand systems as they are, such incentive schemes are ineffective in live streaming systems due mainly to the lack of sufficient opportunity to allow such reciprocity to happen, as recently demonstrated in a pioneering quantitative study. The key insight is that with stringent time constraint, good system performance can only be sustained by judicious peer selection. Despite that some pioneering efforts are done in peer selection, it is as yet a difficult challenge to tackle the inherent non-cooperation of peers in a dynamic and bandwidth-diverse network. In this paper, we meet this challenge by first presenting a novel hierarchical game model, covering strategic interactions among peers, trackers, and the content provider. Based on the analytical insights derived from the repeated game model, we propose a Striker strategy to coerce peers to cooperate, leading to significantly enhanced system performance, as demonstrated by our analytical and simulation results. Most importantly, our proposed incentive schemes are highly practicable in a real-life P2P network. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Most previous experimental studies have been done with college students, not youth. The current study examined the impact of VVGs in an experimental study of teens (12–18). Participants were randomized to play either a violent or non-violent video game. Teens also reported their levels of stress and hostility both before and after video game play. Hostility levels neither decreased nor increased following violent game play, and Bayesian analyzes confirmed that results are supportive of the null hypothesis. By contrast, VVG exposure increased stress, but only for girls. The impact of VVGs on teen hostility is minimal. However, players unfamiliar with such games may find them unpleasant. These results are put into the context of Uses and Gratifications Theory with suggestions for how medical professionals should address the issue of VVG play with concerned parents. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Adolescents; Stress; Video games; Violence",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928128234

In examining these workers, this article responds to calls for renewed attention to the role of the occupation in understanding project-based workers in boundaryless careers. Specifically, this article uses secondary analysis of online sources to demonstrate that video game developers can be understood as a unique social group called an occupational community (OC). Once this classification has been made, the concept of OC can be used in future research to understand video game workers in terms of identity formation, competency development, career advancement and support, collective action, as well as adherence to and deviance from organizational and industry norms. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","creative labour; cultural labour; occupational community; technical labour; video game industry",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928242315

However, state-of-the-art supervised learning-based methods for player localization require a large amount of labeled training data. Hence, the development of automatic systems for player localization becomes indispensable. Volleyball games reach a huge audience base and contain a variety of tactical strategies, necessitating the implementation of systems for inferring tactics and analyzing formations automatically. Therefore, a novel 2D histogram-based player localization method capable of locating players with occlusions is developed and presented in this paper. The proposed system is able to automatically detect the court lines for camera calibration, extract players by calculating both x and y histograms of extracted player masks, and visualize the team formations on real-world court model. The experiments on broadcast volleyball videos demonstrate efficient and effective results against a traditional object segmentation method (connected component analysis) and a supervised learning approach utilizing histogram of oriented gradient features. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Broadcast volleyball video; Camera calibration; Multimedia system; Pattern recognition; People localization; Sports video analysis",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928150558

In Study 1, participants played a video game in which they repeatedly approached one of two similar beverages, while disregarding the other. A subsequent implicit preference for the target beverage emerged, which increased with participants’ thirst. In Study 2, participants approached one brand of potato chips while avoiding the other: Conceptually replicating the moderation observed in Study 1, the implicit preference for the approached brand increased with the number of hours from last food intake. In Study 3, we experimentally manipulated hunger, and the moderation effect emerged again, with hungry participants displaying a higher implicit preference for the approached brand, as compared to satiated participants. In the three studies, the moderation effect was not paralleled in explicit preferences although the latter were affected by the preference inducing manipulation.

Jordi Girona 1-3, Barcelona, Spain","The prevention of accidents is one of the most important goals of ad hoc networks in smart cities. When an accident happens, dynamic sensors (e.g., citizens with smart phones or tablets, smart vehicles and buses, etc.) could shoot a video clip of the accident and send it through the ad hoc network. With a video message, the level of seriousness of the accident could be much better evaluated by the authorities (e.g., health care units, police and ambulance drivers) rather than with just a simple text message. Besides, other citizens would be rapidly aware of the incident. In this way, smart dynamic sensors could participate in reporting a situation in the city using the ad hoc network so it would be possible to have a quick reaction warning citizens and emergency units. The deployment of an efficient routing protocol to manage video-warning messages in mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) has important benefits by allowing a fast warning of the incident, which potentially can save lives. To contribute with this goal, we propose a multipath routing protocol to provide video-warning messages in MANETs using a novel game-theoretical approach. As a base for our work, we start from our previous work, where a 2-players game-theoretical routing protocol was proposed to provide video-streaming services over MANETs. In this article, we further generalize the analysis made for a general number of N players in the MANET. Simulations have been carried out to show the benefits of our proposal, taking into account the mobility of the nodes and the presence of interfering traffic.Finally, we also have tested our approach in a vehicular ad hoc network as an incipient start point to develop a novel proposal specifically designed for VANETs © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","Adaptive multipath routing; Game theory; Mobile ad hoc networks; Nash equilibrium; Smart cities; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Video-streaming services","Boukerche, A., (2008) Algorithms and Protocols for Wireless, Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, , Wiley-IEEE Press: Hoboken, NJ, USA; Lao, L., Cui, J.H., Reducing multicast traffic load for cellular networks using ad hoc networks (2005) In Proceedings of the 2Nd Int’l Conference on Quality of Service in Heterogeneous Wired/Wireless Networks (QShine’05), 22-24 (August), pp. 1-10. , Orlando, FL, USA; Aguilar, M., De La Cruz, L.J., Carrascal, V., Sanvicente, E., A game-theoretical multipath routing for video-streaming services over mobile Ad Hoc networks (2011) Comput.

By comparing AVG experts and amateurs, we found that AVG experts had enhanced functional connectivity and grey matter volume in insular subregions. Furthermore, AVG experts exhibited increased functional connectivity between the attentional and sensorimotor networks, and the experience-related enhancement was predominantly evident in the left insula, an understudied brain area.

These tensions reached a peak when video games journalist Ryan Perez attacked female video game celebrity Felicia Day over Twitter in June 2012, questioning the value of her work and calling her a ‘glorified booth babe’. The Incident quickly became notorious, and Perez was subsequently fired from his writing role with the gamer community site Destructoid. In order to gain an understanding of women's status in video game communities, we analyse the Twitter Incident in historical context and with reference to feminist and technology theory. The Twitter Incident may have functioned either as an act of catharsis or a watershed; Perez's punishment might have released tensions regarding misogyny, or signalled a change in attitude towards women in game culture. Continued mistreatment of women in the game community and industry implies that the Incident functioned as an act of catharsis. However, the notoriety that was raised and criticism Perez received has marked an increase in awareness of misogyny in video game communities and culture. © 2015 Taylor & Francis",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927920573

Fifty non-game-playing young adults were trained on a game called Space Fortress for 30 hours with one of two training regimens: 1) Hybrid Variable-Priority Training (HVT), with part-task training and a focus on improving specific skills and managing task priorities, and 2) Full Emphasis Training (FET) in which participants practiced the whole game to obtain the highest overall score. Fluid intelligence was measured with the Raven's Progressive Matrix task before training. With FET, fluid intelligence was positively associated with learning, suggesting that intellectual ability played a substantial role in determining individual differences in training success. In contrast, with HVT, fluid intelligence was not associated with learning, suggesting that individual differences in fluid intelligence do not factor into training success in a regimen that emphasizes component tasks and flexible task coordination. By analyzing training effects in terms of individual differences and training regimens, the current study offers a training approach that minimizes the potentially limiting effect of individual differences. © 2015 Lee et al.",,"Buitenweg, J.I., Murre, J.M., Ridderinkhof, K.R., Brain training in progress: A review of trainability in healthy seniors (2012) Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 6, p. 183. , PMID: 22737115; Feng, J., Spence, I., Effects of cognitive training on individual differences in attention (2007) Engineering Psychology and Cognitive Ergonomics, pp. 279-287. , Springer; Garrett, D.D., MacDonald, S.W., Craik, F.I., Intraindividual reaction time variability is malleable: Feedback-and education-related reductions in variability with age (2012) Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 6; Jaeggi, S.M., Buschkuehl, M., Shah, P., Jonides, J., The role of individual differences in cognitive training and transfer (2014) Memory & Cognition, 42 (3), pp. 464-480; Jolles, D.D., Crone, E.A., Training the developing brain: A neurocognitive perspective (2012) Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 6, p. 76. , PMID: 22509161; Lee, H., Boot, W.R., Basak, C., Voss, M.W., Prakash, R.S., Neider, M., Performance gains from directed training do not transfer to untrained tasks (2012) Acta Psychologica, 139 (1), pp. 146-158. , PMID: 22133724; Lovden, M., Brehmer, Y., Li, S.C., Lindenberger, U., Training-induced compensation versus magnification of individual differences in memory performance (2012) Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 6, p. 141. , PMID: 22615692; Baniqued, P.L., Kranz, M.B., Voss, M.W., Lee, H., Cosman, J.D., Severson, J., Cognitive training with casual video games: Points to consider (2014) Frontiers in Psychology, 4, p. 1010. , PMID: 24432009; Kliegl, R., Smith, J., Baltes, P.B., On the locus and process of magnification of age differences during mnemonic training (1990) Developmental Psychology, 26 (6), p. 894; Kwon, Y.J., Lawson, A.E., Linking brain growth with the development of scientific reasoning ability and conceptual change during adolescence (2000) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 37 (1), pp. 44-62; Verhaeghen, P., Marcoen, A., On the mechanisms of plasticity in young and older adults after instruction in the method of loci: Evidence for an amplification model (1996) Psychology and Aging, 11 (1), pp. 164-178. , PMID: 8726382; Cox, B.D., Children's use of mnemonic strategies: Variability in response to metamemory training (1994) The Journal of Genetic Psychology, 155 (4), pp. 423-442. , PMID: 7852980; Gaultney, J.F., Bjorklund, D.F., Goldstein, D., To be young, gifted, and strategic: Advantages for memory performance (1996) Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 61 (1), pp. 43-66; Donchin, E., The learning strategies project: Introductory remarks (1989) Acta Psychologica, 71 (1), pp. 1-15; Frederiksen, J.R., White, B.Y., An approach to training based upon principled task decomposition (1989) Acta Psychologica, 71 (1), pp. 89-146; Raven, J., Court, J.H., (2003) Manual for Raven's Progressive Matrices and Vocabulary Scales, , Section1: General Overview San Antonia: Harcourt Assessment; Feng, J., Spence, I., Pratt, J., Playing an action video game reduces gender differences in spatial cognition (2007) Psychological Science, 18 (10), pp. 850-855. , PMID: 17894600; Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, pp. xi+212. , Newbury Park, Calif.: Sage Publications; Raine, L.B., Lee, H.K., Saliba, B.J., Chaddock-Heyman, L., Hillman, C.H., Kramer, A.F., The influence of childhood aerobic fitness on learning and memory (2013) PloS One, 8 (9), p. e72666. , PMID: 24039791; Macnamara, B.N., Hambrick, D.Z., Oswald, F.L., Deliberate Practice and Performance in Music, Games, Sports, Education, and Professions: A Meta-Analysis (2014) Psychological Science, 25 (8), pp. 1608-1618. , PMID: 24986855; Ericsson, K.A., Krampe, R.T., Tesch-Römer, C., (1993) The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance, pp. 363-406. , Berlin-Dahlem, Germany: R.

The aim of the research was to build localised accounts of the multiple interpretations, potential impacts and reactions to the Olympics in everyday family household settings. The views, perceptions and interpretations of the Games were gathered through qualitative research methods, using video diaries and, pre- and post-event, group interviews. Findings from the study illustrated diverse reactions to the legacy messages, resistance to policy interpretations surrounding this mega event and a strong sense of regional and financial exclusion from the event. Lessons can be learnt for both policy-makers and event managers in the design of future events that encompass the localised perspectives of those communities and individuals who consume the event beyond direct physical participation. In particular, themes from the data included the importance of regional community involvement of national showcase events, limitations of existing media and web-based information sources, and the everyday resistance to policy messages assumed as taken for granted.

Of the few comprehensive rehabilitation options that exist for populations with lower baseline cognitive functioning, those that have been successful at eliciting broad cognitive improvements have focused on a multimodal training approach, emphasizing complex cognitive processing that utilizes multiple domains simultaneously. Method: The current study sought to determine the feasibility of an 8-week, hybrid-variable priority training (HVT) program, with a secondary aim to assess the success of this training paradigm at eliciting broad cognitive transfer effects. Capitalizing on the multimodal training modalities offered by the Space Fortress platform, we compared the HVT strategy-based intervention with a waitlist control group, to primarily assess skill acquisition and secondarily determine presence of cognitive transfer. Twenty-eight participants met inclusionary criteria for the study and were randomized to either training or waitlist control groups. To assess broad transfer effects, a battery of neuropsychological tests was administered pre- and post-intervention. Results: The results indicated an overall improvement in skill acquisition and evidence for the feasibility of the intervention, but a lack of broad transfer to tasks of cognitive functioning. Participants in the training group, however, did show improvements on a measure of spatial short-term memory. Conclusions: The current investigation provided support for the feasibility of a multimodal training approach, using the HVT strategy, within the MS population, but lacked broad transfer to multiple domains of cognitive functioning. Future improvements to obtain greater cognitive transfer efficacy would include a larger sample size, a longer course of training to evoke greater game score improvement, the inclusion of only cognitively impaired individuals, and integration of subjective measures of improvement in addition to objective tests of cognitive performance. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","Cognitive training; Multiple sclerosis; Randomized control trial; Skill acquisition; Space Fortress",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927555650

Method: Participants were 2482 English-speaking grade 7 to 12 students. Cross-sectional data collected between 2006 and 2010 as part of the Research on Eating and Adolescent Lifestyles (REAL) study were used. Mental health status was assessed using the Children's Depression Inventory and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children-10. Screen time (hours/day of TV, video games, and computer) was assessed using the Leisure-Time Sedentary Activities questionnaire. Results: Linear multiple regressions indicated that after controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, parental education, geographic area, physical activity, and BMI, duration of screen time was associated with severity of depression (β=0.23, p<. 0.001) and anxiety (β=0.07, p<. 0.01). Video game playing (β= 0.13, p<. .001) and computer use (β=0.17, p<. 0.001) but not TV viewing were associated with more severe depressive symptoms. Video game playing (β=0.11, p<. 0.001) was associated with severity of anxiety. Conclusion: Screen time may represent a risk factor or marker of anxiety and depression in adolescents. Future research is needed to determine if reducing screen time aids the prevention and treatment of these psychiatric disorders in youth. © 2015.","Adolescent; Anxiety; Computers; Depression; Mental health; Sedentary lifestyle; Television; Video games","Are we driving our kids to unhealthy habits?

The same is true of addiction to videogames (Hellman, Schoenmakers, Nordstrom, & Van Holst 2013; Coulombe 2010); or to Facebook (Andreassen et al., 2012; Levard & Soulas, 2010). While certain researchers wished to see this condition included in the DSM-5 (Block, 2008), others question the operational and practical bases for the diagnostic criteria. Some see cyberaddiction as a problem linked more to time management, to brain deficits, to an impulse-control disorder or to psychosocial conditions while others consider it to be a pre-existing comorbidity.Considering that most addiction problems are generally understood more as individual and pathological problems rather than the result of psychosocial conditions (poverty, unemployment, weak social ties, social exclusion, hyper individualism, etc), the aim of this article is to propose a psychosocial perspective for this emerging trend in cyberaddictions. To what extent social conditions and cyberaddiction behaviors constitute a potential pathology? Can we include a psychosocial approach to gain a more general picture of this contemporary issue? In response to these questions, a contextualization and an attempt to define cyberaddiction will be followed by an analysis of some major issues in the development of this type of addiction. A demonstration of the cycle of addiction on how people develop addictions, including cyberaddictions, will be done within a psychosocial perspective in order to seize the multifactorial aspects of this addiction. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Cyber addictions; Facebook; Hyperindividualism; Mental health; Psychosocial perspective; Social ties; Video games","Guide d'activités Bien Joué (2012) Sensibilisation et prévention des risques associés aux jeux d'argent auprès d'adolescents, , (Québec); Andreassen, C.S., Torsheim, T., Brunborg, G.S., Pallesen, S., Development of a Facebook addiction scale (2012) Psychological Reports, 110 (2), pp. 501-517; Bakken, I.J., Wenzel, H.G., Götesman, K.G., Internet addiction among Norwegian adults: A stratified probability sample study (2009) Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, 50, pp. 121-127; Beaston, S., Hosty, G.S., Smith, S., Suicide and the internet (2000) Psychiatry Bulletin, 24 (11), p. 434; Berthier, B., Parisot, L., Panorama des jeux vidéo Psychotropes (2012) Revue Internationale des Toxicomanies et des Addictions, 18 (3-4), pp. 25-43. , (France); Besner, J.M., (2012) Les nouvelles technologies vont-elles réinventer l'homme?, 4146, pp. 763-772. , Études, Paris, (Juin); Block, J.J., (2008).

As a task vehicle, we investigated how attackers attained success in 1v1 sub-phases of basketball by exploring angular relations with immediate opponents and the basket. We hypothesized that angular relations would convey information for the attackers to dribble past defenders. Four basketball players performed as an attacker and defender in 1v1 sub-phases of basketball, in which the co-positioning and orientation of participants relative to the basket was manipulated. After video recording performance behaviors, we digitized participant movement displacement trajectories and categorized trials as successful or unsuccessful (from the attackers' viewpoint). Results revealed that, to successfully dribble past a defender, attackers tended to explore the left hand side of the space by defenders by increasing their angular velocity and decreasing their angular variability, especially in the center of the court. Interpersonal interactions and goal-achievement in attacker-defender dyads appear to have been constrained by the angular relations sustained between participants relative to the scoring target. Results revealed the functionality of exploratory behaviors of participants attempting re-align spatial relations with an opponent in 1v1 sub-phases of team games. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Dyadic systems; Exploratory behaviors; Informational constraints; Interpersonal interactions; Team games","Araújo, D., Davids, K., Ecological approaches to cognition and action in sport and exercise: Ask not only what you do, but where you do it (2009) International Journal of Sport Psychology, 40 (1), pp. 5-37; Araújo, D., Davids, K., Bennett, S., Button, C., Chapman, G., Emergence of sport skills under constraints (2004) Skill acquisition in sport: Research, theory and practice, pp. 409-433. , Routledge, Taylor & Francis, London, A.M.

It has been shown that ErrPs can be automatically detected in tasks with time-discrete feedback, which is widely applied in the field of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for error correction or adaptation. However, there are only a few studies that concentrate on ErrPs during continuous feedback. With this study, we wanted to answer three different questions: (i) Can ErrPs be measured in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during a task with continuous cursor control? (ii) Can ErrPs be classified using machine learning methods and is it possible to discriminate errors of different origins? (iii) Can we use EEG to detect the severity of an error? To answer these questions, we recorded EEG data from 10 subjects during a video game task and investigated two different types of error (execution error, due to inaccurate feedback; outcome error, due to not achieving the goal of an action). We analyzed the recorded data to show that during the same task, different kinds of error produce different ErrP waveforms and have a different spectral response. This allows us to detect and discriminate errors of different origin in an event-locked manner. By utilizing the error-related spectral response, we show that also a continuous, asynchronous detection of errors is possible. Although the detection of error severity based on EEG was one goal of this study, we did not find any significant influence of the severity on the EEG. © 2015 Spüler and Niethammer.","Asynchronous classification; Brain-computer interface (BCI); Error-related negativity (Ne/ERN); Error-related potential (ErrP); Feedback related negativity (FRN); Human-computer interaction; Performance monitoring","Allison, B.Z., Polich, J., Workload assessment of computer gaming using a single-stimulus event-related potential paradigm (2008) Biol.

Frequent gamers have also displayed generalized improvements in perceptual learning. In the Texture Discrimination Task (TDT), a widely used perceptual learning paradigm, participants report the orientation of a target embedded in a field of lines and demonstrate robust over-night improvement. However, changing the orientation of the background lines midway through TDT training interferes with overnight improvements in overall performance on TDT. Interestingly, prior research has suggested that this effect will not occur if a one-hour break is allowed in between the changes. These results have suggested that after training is over, it may take some time for learning to become stabilized and resilient against interference. Here, we tested whether frequent gamers have faster stabilization of perceptual learning compared to non-gamers and examined the effect of daily video game playing on interference of training of TDT with one background orientation on perceptual learning of TDT with a different background orientation. As a result, we found that non-gamers showed overnight performance improvement only on one background orientation, replicating previous results with the interference in TDT. In contrast, frequent gamers demonstrated overnight improvements in performance with both background orientations, suggesting that they are better able to overcome interference in perceptual learning. This resistance to interference suggests that video game playing not only enhances the amplitude and speed of perceptual learning but also leads to faster and/or more robust stabilization of perceptual learning. © 2015 Berard et al.",,"Green, C.S., Bavelier, D., Action video game modifies visual selective attention (2003) Nature, 423, pp. 534-537. , PMID: 12774121; Dye, M.W., Green, C.S., Bavelier, D., The development of attention skills in action video game players (2009) Neuropsychologia, 47, pp. 1780-1789. , PMID: 19428410; Dye, M.W., Green, C.S., Bavelier, D., Increasing Speed of Processing With Action Video Games (2009) Curr Dir Psychol Sci, 18, pp. 321-326. , PMID: 20485453; Boot, W.R., Kramer, A.F., Simons, D.J., Fabiani, M., Gratton, G., The effects of video game playing on attention, memory, and executive control (2008) Acta Psychol (Amst), 129, pp. 387-398. , PMID: 18929349; Boot, W.R., Simons, D.J., Advances in video game methods and reporting practices (but still room for improvement): A commentary on Strobach, Frensch, and Schubert (2012) (2012) Acta Psychol (Amst), 141, pp. 276-277. , discussion 278-280.

The EX was calibrated to generate the same energy expenditure as the AVG session. Energy expenditure was measured using a K4b2 portable indirect calorimeter. Ad libitum food intake (buffet-style meal) and appetite sensations (visual analogue scales) were assessed after the sessions.Results:As expected, mean energy expenditure was similar between AVG (370±4 kcal) and EX (358±3 kcal), both of which were significantly higher than PVG (125±7 kcal) and CON (98±5 kcal) (P<0.001). However, ad libitum food intake after the sessions was not significantly different between CON (1174±282 kcal), PVG (1124±281 kcal), AVG (1098±265 kcal) and EX (1091±290 kcal). Likewise, the energy derived from fat, carbohydrate and protein was not significantly different between sessions, and appetite sensations were not affected.Conclusions:Energy intake and food preferences after an hour of AVG or PVG playing remain unchanged, and isoenergetic sessions of AVG and EX at moderate intensity induce similar nutritional responses in obese adolescent boys.European Journal of Clinical Nutrition advance online publication, 25 March 2015; doi:10.1038/ejcn.2015.31. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925692172

Participants learned to suppress responding to colored sensors in a video-game task where contexts were provided by different gameplay backgrounds. Four experiments assessed the contextual control of simple excitatory learning acquired to a test stimulus (T) after (Exp. 1) or during (Exp. 2–4) extinction of another stimulus (X). Experiment 1 produced no evidence of contextual control of T, though renewal to X was present both at the time T was trained and tested. In Experiment 2 no contextual control of T was evident when X underwent extensive conditioning and extinction. In Experiment 3 no contextual control of T was evident after extensive conditioning and extinction of X, and renewal to X was present. In Experiment 4 contextual control was evident to T, but it neither depended upon nor was enhanced by extinction of X.

Interventions to influence fruit and vegetable intake among youth have had mixed effects. Innovative, theory-driven interventions are needed. Goal setting, enhanced by implementation intentions (i.e., plans tightly connected to a behavioral goal), may offer a solution. Action plans state ""how"" a goal will be achieved, while coping plans identify a potential barrier and corresponding solution. The research reported here evaluated the short- and long-term effects of goal setting enhanced with implementation intentions on child fruit and vegetable intake in a 10-episode, theoretically-grounded serious videogame promoting fruit and vegetables. This is one of the first studies to test the efficacy of implementation intentions on the dietary intake of healthy children. Methods: A four-group randomized design with three data collection periods (baseline, immediate post-intervention, 3months post-intervention) was employed. Groups varied on whether children created an implementation intention (none, action, coping, both) as part of goal setting. Participants were 4th and 5th grade children (~9-11 years old) and one parent. An a priori power analysis indicated this would provide >80% power to detect a small effect (Cohen's d=0.17). Children played a 10-episode online videogame; parents received 10 electronic newsletters and access to a parent-only website. The primary outcome was child fruit and vegetable intake, assessed via three, dietitian-assisted telephone recalls at each data collection period. The primary analysis was conducted using a repeated measures analysis of covariance with a mixed model procedure. Secondary analyses examined intervention effects on fruit and vegetables separately. Results: Four hundred parent/child dyads were recruited. A significant group-by-time interaction for fruit and vegetable intake (p<0.001) was found in only the Action group, which had significant increases in fruit and vegetable intake at post 1 (p<0.0001) and post 2 (p<0.0001). No other significant interactions were observed; however, there were significant time effects for fruit (p<0.0001). Conclusions: Action intentions may be an important component of successful interventions to increase and maintain fruit and vegetable intake in pre-adolescent children. Videogames promoting healthy diets offer an effective vehicle for delivering behavior change interventions to children. © Thompson et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Children; Fruit; Implementation intentions; Maintenance; Vegetables; Videogame","(2011), Healthy People 2020: Understanding and Improving Health. 2nd ed.

The objective of this paper was to identify correlates of total sedentary time (SED) and correlates of self-reported screen time (ST) in Canadian children. Methods: Child- and parent-reported household, socio-demographic, behavioural, and diet related data were collected; directly measured anthropometric and accelerometer data were also collected for each child. Participants with complete demographic, anthropometric, and either SED (n=524, 41% boys) or ST (n=567, 42% boys) data from the Canadian site of the International Study of Childhood Obesity Lifestyle and the Environment (ISCOLE) were included in analysis. Sixteen potential correlates of SED and ST were examined using multilevel general linear models, adjusting for sex, ethnicity, number of siblings, and socio-economic status. All explanatory variables moderately associated (p<0.10) with SED and/or ST in univariate analyses were included in the final, fully-adjusted models. Variables that remained significant in the final models (p<0.05) were considered correlates of SED and/or ST. Results: Children averaged 8.5hours of daily SED; no differences in total SED, or total ST were seen between girls and boys, but boys reported significantly more video game/computer usage than girls. Boys also had higher waist circumference and BMI z-scores than girls. In the final models, waist circumference and number of TVs in the home were the only common correlates of both SED and ST. SED was also negatively associated with sleep duration. ST was also positively associated with mother's weight status, father's education, and unhealthy eating pattern score and negatively associated with healthy eating pattern score, and weekend breakfast consumption. Few common correlates existed between boys and girls. Conclusion: Several factors were identified as correlates of SED and/or of ST in Canadian children; however, few correlates were common for both SED and ST, and for both boys and girls. This suggests that a single strategy to reduce SED and ST is unlikely to be effective. Future work should examine a variety of other, non-screen based sedentary behaviours and their potential correlates in the hopes of creating tailored public health messages to reduce SED and ST in both boys, and girls. © LeBlanc et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Pediatric; Sedentary behaviour; Television viewing","Letter to the Editor: Standardized use of the terms ""sedentary"" and ""sedentary behaviours.""

Evidence from paradigms that assess aspects of attention has suggested that action video game players (AVGPs) possess greater control over the allocation of attentional resources than do non-video-game players (NVGPs). Using a compound search task that teased apart selection- and response-based processes (Duncan, 1985), we required participants to perform an oculomotor capture task in which they made saccades to a uniquely colored target (selection-based process) and then produced a manual directional response based on information within the target (response-based process). We replicated the finding that AVGPs are less susceptible to attentional distraction and, critically, revealed that AVGPs outperform NVGPs on both selection-based and response-based processes. These results not only are consistent with the improved-attentional-control account of AVGP benefits, but they suggest that the benefit of action video game playing extends across the full breadth of attention-mediated stimulus–response processes that impact human performance. © 2015 Psychonomic Society, Inc.","Attentional capture; Cognitive and attentional control; Eye movements; Visual attention; Visual search",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924706382

Obesity is not just being overweight. It is a metabolic disorder due to the accumulation of excess dietary calories into visceral fat and the release of high concentrations of free fatty acids into various organs. It represents a state of chronic oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation whose intermediary molecules may include leptin, adiponectin and cytokines. It may progress to hyperglycemia, leading to type 2 diabetes. Whether or not dietary antioxidant supplements are useful in the management of obesity and type 2 diabetes is discussed in this review. Only the benefits for obesity and diabetes are examined here. Other health benefits of antioxidants are not considered. There are difficulties in comparing studies in this field because they differ in the time frame, participants' ethnicity, administration of antioxidant supplements, and even in how obesity was measured. However, the literature presents reasonable evidence for marginal benefits of supplementation with zinc, lipoic acid, carnitine, cinnamon, green tea, and possibly vitamin C plus E, although the evidence is much weaker for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, green coffee, resveratrol, or lycopene. Overall, antioxidant supplements are not a panacea to compensate for a fast-food and video-game way of living, but antioxidant-rich foods are recommended as part of the lifestyle. Such antioxidant foods are commonly available. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel Copyright © 2015, S. Karger AG. All rights reserved.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925436836

This study investigated brain function in IGD individuals using task-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It is a prospective study in 19 IGD individuals and 19 matched healthy controls. They all received internet videogame stimuli while a 3.0 T fMRI was used to assess echo planar imaging. Brain activity was analyzed using the Brain Voyager software package. Functional data were spatially smoothed using Gaussian kernel. The threshold level was positioned at 10 pixels, and the activation range threshold was set to 10 voxels. Activated brain regions were compared between the two groups, as well as the amount of activated voxels. The internet videogame stimuli activated brain regions in both groups. Compared with controls, the IGD group showed increased activation in the right superior parietal lobule, right insular lobe, right precuneus, right cingulated gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, and left brainstem. There was a significant difference in the number of activated voxels between the two groups. An average of 1078 voxels was activated in the IGD group compared with only 232 in the control group. Internet videogame play activates the vision, space, attention, and execution centers located in the occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal gyri.

However, theneural basis underlying the enhanced behavioral performance remains largely unknown. To clarify this issue, the present study compared the whiter matter integrity within the corticospinal tracts (CST), the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) between the VGPs and the NVGCs using diffusion tensor imaging. Compared with the NVGCs, voxel-wise comparisons revealed significantly higher fractional anisotropy (FA) values in some regions within the left CST, left SLF, bilateral ILF, and IFOF in VGPs. Furthermore, higher FA values in the left CST at the level of cerebral peduncle predicted a faster response in visual attention tasks. These results suggest that higher white matter integrity in the motor and higher-tier visual pathways isassociated with long-term video game playing, which may contribute to the understanding on how video game play influences motor and visual performance. © 2015 Zhang, Du, Yang, Qin, Li and Zhang.","Diffusion tensor imaging; Inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus; Inferior longitudinal fasciculus; Superior longitudinal fasciculus; Video game; White matter","Aralasmak, A., Ulmer, J.L., Kocak, M., Salvan, C.V., Hillis, A.E., Yousem, D.M., Association, commissural, and projection pathways and their functional deficit reported in literature (2006) J.

In the first experiment, experienced gamers and controls drove in a driving simulator, with and without distraction. Experienced AVG players exhibited fewer lane deviations during driving as compared to non-gamers; however, video game experience was not associated with fewer lane deviations while distracted. These results showed evidence for the video game experience effect however, no evidence of improved cognitive ability was found. In the second experiment, we informed participants of the hypothesis to replicate the methods of studies that do not mask the purpose of the research. We found video game experience again was associated with fewer driving errors, but was still not associated with better driving performance while distracted; however, gamers recalled more details of the distracting conversation and reported lower workload while driving than non-gamers. We use these results to argue for caution in interpreting research with experienced gamers and increased replication with attention paid to recruitment methodology within this research domain. Finally, our results indicate that understanding the nature of AVG experience on task performance requires careful attention to motivational factors. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Action games; Distracted driving; Videogame playing",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924401817

The early onset age of gambling is a known risk factor for developing gambling problems later in life. The aims of this study are: to evaluate the internal consistency reliability, factorial validity and classification accuracy of the Finnish version of DSM-IV-Multiple Response-Juvenile (DSM-IV-MR-J) criteria measuring at-risk/problem gambling (ARPG); to examine gender differences in gambling participation, ARPG and substance use among first-year junior high school students; and to investigate the association of gambling and gaming (video game playing) participation, substance use and social variables with ARPG. Methods: This study examined 988 adolescents (mean age 13.4 years) at 11 public schools in Finland between October-December 2013. The response rate was 91.6%. Chi-squared test and binary logistic regression analysis were used. Results: 'Illegal acts' was the most endorsed and sensitive, but the least specific criteria identifying ARPG. During the past year, 51.6% of the respondents had gambled, 7.9% were identified as at-risk/problem gamblers (DSM-IV-MR-J score ≥ 2), 8.0% had smoked and 8.9% had been drinking for intoxication, and the first three were significantly more common among boys than girls. The odds ratio of being a male past-year at-risk/problem gambler was 2.27, 5.78 for gambling often or sometimes, 2.42 for video game playing weekly or more often and 6.23 for having peer gamblers. Conclusions: Overall, the Finnish version of the DSM-IV-MR-J had acceptable internal consistency reliability and factorial validity. None of the DSM-IV-MR-J criteria were accurate enough to screen ARPG per se. ARPG past-year prevalence was relatively high with males gambling more than females. ARPG was as common as drinking alcohol for intoxication and smoking. Peer gambling was strongly associated with ARPG. Efficient strategies to minimise the risks of gambling problems, tools for prevention and identification of ARPG among the underage are needed. © Castrén et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Adolescents; At-risk/problem gambling; DSM-IV-MR-J; Gender; Smoking; Social variables; Substance use","Forrest, D., McHale, I.G., Gambling and problem gambling among young adolescents in Great Britain (2012) J Gambl Stud, 28, pp. 607-622; Steinberg, L., A dual systems model of adolescent risk taking (2010) Dev Psychobiol, 52, pp. 216-224; Casey, B., Jones, R.M., Breaking and accelerating of the adolescent brain (2011) J Res Adolesc, 2011 (21), pp. 21-33; Blinn-Pike, L., Worth, S., Jonkman, J., Adolescent gambling: a review of the emerging field of research (2010) J Adol Health, 47, pp. 223-236; Hodgins, D., Stea, J., Grant, J., Gambling disorders (2011) Lancet, 37, pp. 1874-1884; Derevensky, J.L., Gupta, R., Winters, K., Prevalence rates of youth gambling problems: are current rates inflated?

Active video gaming can, however, only be beneficial for weight management when it replaces sedentary activities and not other physical activity, and when it is not associated with a higher energy intake. The current study therefore examines the association between active video gaming and other energy-balance-related behaviours (EBRBs). Findings: Adolescents (12-16 years) with access to an active video game and who reported to spend at least one hour per week in active video gaming were invited to participate in the study. They were asked to complete electronic 24-hour recall diaries on five randomly assigned weekdays and two randomly assigned weekend-days in a one-month period, reporting on time spent playing active and non-active video games and on other EBRBs. Findings indicated that adolescents who reported playing active video games on assessed days also reported spending more time playing non-active video games (Median = 23.6, IQR = 56.8 minutes per week) compared to adolescents who did not report playing active video games on assessed days (Median = 10.0, IQR = 51.3 minutes per week, P < 0.001 (Mann Whitney test)). No differences between these groups were found in other EBRBs. Among those who played active video games on assessed days, active video game time was positively yet weakly associated with TV/DVD time and snack consumption. Active video game time was not significantly associated with other activities and sugar-sweetened beverages intake. Conclusions: The results suggest that it is unlikely that time spent by adolescents in playing active video games replaces time spent in other physically active behaviours or sedentary activities. Spending more time playing active video games does seem to be associated with a small, but significant increase in intake of snacks. This suggests that interventions aimed at increasing time spent on active video gaming, may have unexpected side effects, thus warranting caution. © 2015 Simons et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Active video games; Adolescents; Associations; Beverages; Energy intake; Health behaviours; Physical activity; Sedentary behaviour; Snacks",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928738794

The reasons include a wide use of technology and a lack of enjoyment while exercising. The purpose of this study was to compare the physiological, perceptual and enjoyment responses between a single bout of (I) conventional cycling and (II) interactive cycling video game at a matched workload. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 34 healthy participants was performed. Initially, participants completed an incremental maximal cycling test to measure peak oxygen uptake and to determine ventilatory threshold. In random order, participants carried out a 30 min interactive cycling trial and a 30 min conventional cycling trial at 55% of peak power output. During the trials, oxygen uptake and energy expenditure were measured by open-circuit spirometry and heart rate was measured by radiotelemetry. RPE and enjoyment were measured every 10 minutes with Borg scale and a modified PACES scale. Results: Interactive cycling resulted in a significantly greater %VO2Reserve (68.2% ± 9.2% vs 64.7% ± 8.1%), rate of energy expenditure (505.8±75.2 vs 487.4±81.2 j·kg-1·min-1), and enjoyment (63.4% ± 17 vs 42% ± 13.6), P<0.05. Participants were working at a higher intensity in relation to the individual's ventilatory threshold during the interactive cycling video game trial (M = 11.86, SE = 3.08) than during the Conventional cycling trial (M = 7.55, SE = 3.16, t(33) = -2.69, P<0.05, r =.42). No significant differences were found for heart rate reserve (72.5 ± 10.4 vs 71.4±10.1%) and RPE (13.1 ± 1.8 vs 13.2 ± 1.7). Conclusion: Interactive cycling games can be a valid alternative to conventional exercise as they result in a higher exercise intensity than conventional cycling and a distraction from aversive cognitive and physiological states at and above the ventilatory threshold. © 2015 Monedero et al.",,"Leslie, E., Owen, N., Salmon, J., Bauman, A., Sallis, J.F., Lo, S.K., Insufficiently active Australian college students: Perceived personal, social, and environmental influences (1999) Prev Med, 28, pp. 20-27. , 9973584; Booth, M.L., Owen, N., Bauman, A., Clavisi, O., Leslie, E., Social-cognitive and perceived environment influences associated with physical activity in older Australians (2000) Prev Med, 31, pp. 15-22. , 10896840; Booth, F.W., Chakravarthy, M.V., Gordon, S.E., Spangenburg, E.E., Waging war on physical inactivity: Using modern molecular ammunition against an ancient enemy (2002) J Appl Physiol, 93, pp. 3-30. , 12070181; Kruk, J., Physical activity in the prevention of the most frequent chronic diseases: An analysis of the recent evidence (2007) Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 8, pp. 325-338. , 18159963; Hallal, P., Andersen, L., Bull, F., Guthold, R., Haskell, W., Ekelund, U., Global physical activity levels: Surveillance progress, pitfalls, and prospects (2012) Lancet, 380, pp. 247-257. , 22818937; Lakdawalla, D., Philipson, T., (2002) The Growth of Obesity and Technological Change: A Theoretical and Empirical Examination Res.

Two cross-sectional studies examined the extent to which everyday sadism predicts the amount of violent video game play. Past research has shown that everyday sadists obtain pleasure from cruel behaviors. Hence, I reasoned that everyday sadists are drawn to violent video games because killing game characters might be an opportunity to satisfy their need for cruelty. In fact, results revealed a positive link between everyday sadism and the amount of violent video game exposure.

Given the growing popularity of video gaming and the increasing literature on cognitive aspects of video gamers, there is a growing need for novel approaches to assessment of the cognitive processes that occur while persons are immersed in video games. In this study, we assessed various stimulus modalities and gaming events using an off-the-shelf EEG devise. A significant difference was found among different stimulus modalities with increasingly difficult cognitive demands. Specifically, beta and gamma power were significantly increased during high intensity events when compared to low intensity gaming events. Our findings suggest that the Emotiv EEG can be used to differentiate between varying stimulus modalities and accompanying cognitive processes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cognitive; Electroencephalographic; Emotiv EPOC; Video games","Essential Facts about the Computer and Video Game Industry: Sales, Demographic, and Usage Data (2010)Rideout, V.J., Roberts, D.F., Foehr, U.G., Generation, M., Media in the Lives of 8-18year olds: Executive Summary (2005)Cain, M.S., Landau, A.N., Shimamura, A.P., Action video game experience reduces the cost of switching tasks (2012) Attention Percept.

We examined variables derived from eco-dialogical coding of an episode of World of Warcraft play involving three English learners. According to the Eco-dialogical model (Zheng, 2012), second language (L2) learners need to learn to take skilled linguistic action (Cowley, 2013), a process of realizing the values of physical, sociocultural and dialogical affordances in the environment. We employed Multinomial Logistic Regression to determine which of our variables were predictors for three types of values realizing; namely, wayfinding orienting to sociocultural norms and synergized values realizing of both wayfinding and orientation to sociocultural norms. The model we developed suggested that when communicative projects collectively entailed players' a) verbalizing with synchronized avatar action, b) attending to game rules and c) coordinating in anticipation of good future prospects, players were more likely to realize both values realizing types synergistically. In other words, players' skilled linguistic action of prospective coordination, combined with multimodal languaging and constrained by WoW game rules, together, were more likely to lead to dual values realizing. This finding suggests that dual values realizing evokes connections between real-time first-order physical movements and multimodal languaging with situation transcending practices (Linell, 2009) which are second-order rules, and other sociocultural and linguistic norms. Coupling this finding with our Eco-dialogical unit of analysis, communicative projects, we suggest that these language learners developed co-agency. We conclude that our model should be tested in future studies that seek to illuminate the contribution of a new Eco-dialogical understanding of L2 learning and the potential for learners to have high quality languaging experiences in multiplayer 3D game environments and other social semiotically rich contexts. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Dialogicality; Ecological psychology; Languaging; Skilled linguistic action; Values realizing; Video games","Azen, R., Walker, C., (2011) Categorical Data Analysis for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, , Routledge, New York; Barab, S., Gresalfi, M., Ingram-Goble, A., Transformational play: using games to position person, content and context (2010) Educ.

This trend may have implications for the way that lay people think about addictions and about people struggling with addictive disorders. The aim of this study was to provide a better understanding of how the public understands a variety of substance-related and behavioral addictions. Methods: A representative sample of 4000 individuals from Alberta, Canada completed an online survey. Participants were randomly assigned to answer questions about perceived addiction liability, etiology, and prevalence of problems with four substances (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and cocaine) and six behaviors (problematic gambling, eating, shopping, sexual behavior, video gaming, and work). Results: Bivariate analyses revealed that respondents considered substances to have greater addiction liability than behaviors and that most risk factors (moral, biological, or psychosocial) were considered as more important in the etiology of behavioral versus substance addictions. A discriminant function analysis demonstrated that perceived addiction liability and character flaws were the two most important features differentiating judgments of substance-related versus behavioral addictions. Perceived addiction liability was judged to be greater for substances. Conversely, character flaws were viewed as more associated with behavioral addictions. Conclusions: The general public appreciates the complex bio-psycho-social etiology underlying addictions, but perceives substance-related and behavioral addictions differently. These attitudes, in turn, may shape a variety of important outcomes, including the extent to which people believed to manifest behavioral addictions feel stigmatized, seek treatment, or initiate behavior changes on their own. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Behavioral addictions; Etiology; Lay theory; Stigma; Substance-related addictions","Adlaf, E.M., Hamilton, H.A., Wu, F., Noh, S., Adolescent stigma towards drug addiction: Effects of age and drug use behaviour (2009) Addictive Behaviors, 34 (4), pp. 360-364; Ahern, J., Stuber, J., Galea, S., Stigma, discrimination and the health of illicit drug users (2007) Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 88 (2-3), pp. 188-196; (2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , American Psychiatric Association, Washington DC; (2010) If you smoke too much 'blame your genes', say experts, , http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8643803.stm, Retrieved 03.12.2013, from; (2013) Fat-boosting gene mystery 'solved', , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23312712, Retrieved 03.12.2013, from; Bergen-Cico, D.K., Haygood-El, A., Jennings-Bey, T.N., Lane, S.D., Street addiction: A proposed theoretical model for understanding the draw of street life and gang activity (2014) Addiction Research & Theory, , (in press); Chassin, L., Presson, C.C., Rose, J., Sherman, S.J., What is addiction?

Most secondary OLPE courses focus on the cognitive pieces of the curriculum, and to a lesser degree, fitness for life due to a lack of research. The omission of the physical, social and emotional components of the OLPE curriculum has created a rift in the understanding, growth and development of students who take these courses. For this reason, Kinesiology professionals need to take a lead in the development of OLPE curricula through efficacious research. Exergaming has shown positive results for each of these four components when played proximally; however, exergames have not been widely studied in remote Internet settings. An exploration of the present need for more research into the ramifications of OLPE and the role Kinesiology professionals can take in guiding this process along with the potential of exergames in OLPE to fill this curricular void is presented. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","Active video games; E-learning; Exergames; Technology; Virtual education",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923923837

To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Methods This was a cross-sectional study screening children for sub-normal vision and refractive errors in Delhi. Vision was tested by trained health workers using ETDRS charts. Risk factor questionnaire was filled for children with vision <6/9.5, wearing spectacles and for a subset (10%) of randomly selected children with normal vision. All children with vision <6/9.5 underwent cycloplegic refraction. The prevalence of myopia <-0.5 diopters was assessed. Association of risk factors and prevalence of myopia was analyzed for children with myopia and randomly selected non myopic children and adjusted odds ratio values for all risk factors were estimated. Results A total number of 9884 children were screened with mean age of 11.6 + 2.2 years and 66.8% boys. Prevalence of myopia was 13.1%with only 320 children (24.7%) wearing appropriate spectacles. Mean myopic spherical error was -1.86 + 1.4 diopters. Prevalence of myopia was higher in private schools compared to government schools (p <0.001), in girls vs. boys (p = 0.004) and among older (> 11 years) children (p<0.001). There was a positive association of myopia with studying in private schools vs. government schools (p<0.001), positive family history (p < 0.001) and higher socio-economic status (p = 0.037). Positive association of presence of myopia was observed with children studying/reading > 5 hours per day (p < 0.001), watching television > 2 hours / day (p < 0.001) and with playing computer/ video/mobile games (p < 0.001). An inverse association with outdoor activities/playing was observed with children playing > 2 hours in a day. Conclusion Myopia is a major health problem in Indian school children. It is important to identify modifiable risk factors associated with its development and try to develop cost effective intervention strategies. © 2015 Saxena et al.",,"Resnikoff, S., Pascolini, D., Mariotti, S.P., Pokharel, G.P., Global magnitude of visual impairment caused by uncorrected refractive errors in 2004 (2008) Bull World Health Organ., 86 (1), pp. 63-70. , Jan PMID: 18235892; Morgan, I.G., Ohno-Matsui, K., Saw, S.M., Myopia (2012) Lancet, 379, pp. 1739-1748. , PMID: 22559900; Pan, C.W., Ramamurthy, D., Saw, S.M., Worldwide prevalence and risk factors for myopia (2012) Ophthalmic Physiol Opt., 32 (1), pp. 3-16. , Jan PMID: 22150586; Vitale, S., Sperduto, R.D., Ferris, F.L., Increased prevalence of myopia in the United States between 1971-1972 and 1999-2004 (2009) Arch Ophthalmol., 127 (12), pp. 1632-1639. , Dec PMID: 20008719; Matsumura, H., Hirai, H., Prevalence of myopia and refractive changes in students from 3 to 17 years of age (1999) Surv Ophthalmol, 44, pp. S109-S115. , PMID: 10548123; Yoon, K.C., Mun, G.H., Kim, S.D., Kim, S.H., Kim, C.Y., Prevalence of eye diseases in South Korea: Data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008-2009 (2011) Korean J Ophthalmol, 25, pp. 421-433. , PMID: 22131780; Lim, H.T., Yoon, J.S., Hwang, S.S., Lee, S.Y., Prevalence and associated sociodemographic factors of myopia in Korean children: The 2005 third Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES III) (2012) Jap J Ophthalmol, 56, pp. 76-81; Saw, S.M., Zhang, M.Z., Hong, R.Z., Fu, Z.F., Near-work activity, night-lights, and myopia in the Singapore-China study (2002) Arch Ophthalmol., 120 (5), pp. 620-627. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Tan%20DT%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=12003612, May PMID: 12003612; Lin, L.L., Shih, Y.F., Hsiao, C.K., Chen, C.J., Prevalence of myopia in Taiwanese schoolchildren: 1983 to 2000 (2004) Ann Acad Med Singapore, 33, pp. 27-33. , PMID: 15389303; Lin, L.L., Shih, Y.F., Hsiao, C.K., Chen, C.J., Lee, L.A., Epidemiologic study of the prevalence and severity of myopia among schoolchildren in Taiwan in 2000 (2001) J Formos Med Assoc., 100 (10), pp. 684-691. , Oct PMID: 11760374; Fan, D.S., Lam, D.S., Lam, R.F., Lau, J.T., Chong, K.S., Prevalence, incidence, and progression of myopia of school children in Hong Kong (2004) Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci, 45, pp. 1071-1075. , PMID: 15037570; Lam, C.S., Lam, C.H., Cheng, S.C., Chan, L.Y., Prevalence of myopia among Hong Kong Chinese schoolchildren: Changes over two decades (2012) Ophthalmic Physiol Opt., 32 (1), pp. 17-24. , Jan PMID: 22150587; He, M., Zeng, J., Liu, Y., Xu, J., Pokharel, G.P., Refractive error and visual impairment in urban children in southern China (2004) Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci, 45, pp. 793-799. , PMID: 14985292; Qian, Y.S., Chu, R.Y., He, J.C., Sun, X.H., Zhou, X.T., Incidence of myopia in high school students with and without red-green color vision deficiency (2009) Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci, 50, pp. 1598-1605. , PMID: 19098322; You, Q.S., Wu, L.J., Duan, J.L., Luo, Y.X., Liu, L.J., Prevalence of myopia in school children in greater Beijing: The Beijing childhood eye study (2014) Acta Ophthalmol., 92 (5), pp. e398-e406. , Aug PMID: 25165786; Wu, J.F., Bi, H.S., Wang, S.M., Hu, Y.Y., Wu, H., Refractive error, visual acuity and causes of vision loss in children in Shandong, China.

In this study, we examined overall engagement and three sub-domains of engagement as outcome variables after ten sessions of treatment with fifth grade students. The results showed that both male and female the video game group had slight increases in all engagement levels while students, particularly male, in the paper-and-pencil drill group displayed large decreases in all engagement levels. Implications of the study are 1) more fine-grained evidence of engagement in three sub-domains after implementing an educational video game, and 2) a consideration of gender differences in engagement levels in mathematics in the adoption of a video games. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Behavioral engagement; Cognitive engagement; Educational video game; Emotional engagement; Gender difference; Mathematics engagement",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923241514

Methods: Data are from the ROOTS study. MVPA and sedentary time were assessed using combined movement and heart rate sensing. Time spent TV viewing, using the internet, playing video games, doing homework and reading for pleasure was self-reported. Data on objectively-measured and self-reported outcomes for weekdays was available for 738 (age 14.5y, 55.7% female) and 800 (56.3% female) participants, respectively. Adolescents perceived family functioning and friendship quality (Two subscales: 'Good friendship qualities', 'Friendship difficulties') was assessed by questionnaire. Analyses were conducted using multi-level linear or logistic regression. Results: Adolescents reporting better family functioning accumulated more MVPA on weekdays (beta; 95% confidence interval: 0.57; 0.17,0.98). Higher scores on the good friendship qualities subscale was associated with greater MVPA throughout the week (weekdays: 1.13; 0.62,1.65, weekend: 0.56; 0.09,1.02) and lower sedentary time on weekdays (-10.34; -17.03,-3.66). Boys from better functioning families were less likely to report playing video games at the weekend (OR; 95% confidence interval: 0.73; 0.57,0.93) or reading for pleasure (weekday: 0.73; 0.56,0.96 weekend: 0.75; 0.58,0.96). Boys who attained higher scores on the good friendship qualities scale were less likely to play video games at the weekend (0.61; 0.44,0.86) or report high homework on weekdays (0.54; 0.31,0.94). A higher score for good friendship qualities was associated with lower odds of girls playing video games during the week (0.76; 0.58,1.00) or reading for pleasure at the weekend (0.61; 0.42,0.88). Girls that reported fewer friendship difficulties had lower odds of high TV viewing (0.76; 0.62,0.93) or playing video games (0.71; 0.52,0.97) at the weekend, and lower odds of reading for pleasure (0.63; 0.49,0.81) or reporting high homework on weekdays (0.70; 0.52,0.95). Discussion: Family functioning and friendship quality exhibit a complex pattern of association with physical activity and sedentary behaviour that varies by sex and day of the week. Findings highlight the potential value of targeting interpersonal aspects of the family and friendships as an adjunct to behaviour change interventions. © 2015 Atkin et al.","Adolescents; Family; Peers; Physical activity; Sedentary behaviour","Biddle, S.J.H., Asare, M., Physical activity and mental health in children and adolescents: a review of reviews (2011) Br J Sports Med, 45, pp. 886-895; Janssen, I., Leblanc, A.G., Systematic review of the health benefits of physical activity and fitness in school-aged children and youth (2010) Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act, 7, p. 40; Ekelund, U., Tomkinson, G., Armstrong, N., What proportion of youth are physically active?

The present study aimed to identify sociodemographic factors and health-risk behaviours associated with sports and energy drink consumption among young adults.Design: Cross-sectional analysis of survey data from the third wave of a cohort study (Project EAT-III: Eating and Activity in Teens and Young Adults). Regression models stratified on gender and adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics were used to examine associations of sports and energy drink consumption with eating behaviours, physical activity, media use, weight-control behaviours, sleep patterns and substance use.Setting: Participants completed baseline surveys in 1998–1999 as students at public secondary schools in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota, USA and the EAT-III surveys online or by mail in 2008–2009.Subjects: The sample consisted of 2287 participants (55 % female, mean age 25·3 years).Results: Results showed 31·0 % of young adults consumed sports drinks and 18·8 % consumed energy drinks at least weekly. Among men and women, sports drink consumption was associated with higher sugar-sweetened soda and fruit juice intake, video game use and use of muscle-enhancing substances like creatine (P≤0·01). Energy drink consumption was associated with lower breakfast frequency and higher sugar-sweetened soda intake, video game use, use of unhealthy weight-control behaviours, trouble sleeping and substance use among men and women (P<0·05).Conclusions: Health professionals should consider the clustering of sports and energy drink consumption with other unhealthy behaviours in the design of programmes and services for young adults.

Neuroimaging studies suggest that video games might have an influence on the reward system. However, it is not clear whether reward-related properties represent a precondition, which biases an individual toward playing video games, or if these changes are the result of playing video games.Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal study to explore reward-related functional predictors in relation to video gaming experience as well as functional changes in the brain in response to video game training. Fifty healthy participants were randomly assigned to a video game training (TG) or control group (CG). Before and after training/control period, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted using a non-video game related reward task. At pretest, both groups showed strongest activation in ventral striatum (VS) during reward anticipation. At posttest, the TG showed very similar VS activity compared to pretest. In the CG, the VS activity was significantly attenuated. This longitudinal study revealed that video game training may preserve reward responsiveness in the VS in a retest situation over time. We suggest that video games are able to keep striatal responses to reward flexible, a mechanism which might be of critical value for applications such as therapeutic cognitive training. © 2015 Berchicci, Tamburro and Comani.","FMRI; Longitudinal; Reward anticipation; Training; Video gaming","Abler, B., Walter, H., Erk, S., Neural correlates of frustration (2005) Neuroreport, 16, pp. 669-672; Allaire, J.C., McLaughlin, A.C., Trujillo, A., Whitlock, L.A., Laporte, L., Gandy, M., Successful aging through digital games: Socioemotional differences between older adult gamers and non-gamers (2013) Comput.

Three studies examined whether potentially threatening scientific findings motivate group members to take action against the respective findings by publicly discrediting them on the Web. Results show that strongly (vs. weakly) identified group members (i.e., people who identified as ""gamers"") were particularly likely to discredit social identity threatening findings publicly (i.e., studies that found an effect of playing violent video games on aggression). A content analytical evaluation of online comments revealed that social identification specifically predicted critiques of the methodology employed in potentially threatening, but not in non-threatening research (Study 2). Furthermore, when participants were collectively (vs. self-) affirmed, identification did no longer predict discrediting posting behavior (Study 3). These findings contribute to the understanding of the formation of online collective action and add to the burgeoning literature on the question why certain scientific findings sometimes face a broad public opposition. © 2015 Nauroth et al.",,"Batts, S., Anthis, N.J., Smith, T., Advancing science through conversations: Bridging the gap between blogs and the academy (2008) PLOS Biol, 6, pp. 1837-1841;

In this paper, we propose a game-theoretical framework over a multi-view and multi-video network where one server delivers multiple multi-view 3D videos to multiple viewers. In a mobile network, any individual viewers can subscribe to a video with any viewing angle within a specified viewing range in 3D-enabled mobile handsets. To facilitate efficient resource allocation for multi-view 3D videos, we formulate a new resource allocation problem, named Price-based 3D Viewing Range Control problem (PVRC), as a Stackelberg game in Game Theory, in which the server and the viewers are modeled as the leader and the followers, respectively, to jointly consider the revenue of the server and the utilities of the viewers. We analyze the price setting problem by investigating the Stackelberg equilibrium between the server and viewers. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to popular uniform-price setting, non-uniform pricing is an effective approach for reducing the difference of utilities among the viewers, effectively controlling the viewing ranges and avoiding starvation of the network resources to only few viewers. Moreover, we also derive the social optimum in the problem, and the simulation results show that the derived Stackelberg equilibrium is close to the social optimum. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","3D video; game theory; Multimedia networking","Kubota, A., Smolic, A., Magnor, M., Tanimoto, M., Chen, T., Zhang, C., Multiview imaging and 3dtv (2007) IEEE Signal Process.

While not officially a clinical diagnosis according to the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), individuals with IAD manifest severe emotional, social, and mental dysfunction in multiple areas of daily activities due to their problematic use of technology and the internet. Method: We report a 31. year-old man who exhibited problematic use of Google Glass™. The patient has a history of a mood disorder most consistent with a substance induced hypomania overlaying a depressive disorder, anxiety disorder with characteristics of social phobia and obsessive compulsive disorder, and severe alcohol and tobacco use disorders. Results: During his residential treatment program at the Navy's Substance Abuse and Recovery Program (SARP) for alcohol use disorder, it was noted that the patient exhibited significant frustration and irritability related to not being able to use his Google Glass™. The patient exhibited a notable, nearly involuntary movement of the right hand up to his temple area and tapping it with his forefinger. He reported that if he had been prevented from wearing the device while at work, he would become extremely irritable and argumentative. Conclusions: Over the course of his 35-day residential treatment, the patient noted a reduction in irritability, reduction in motor movements to his temple to turn on the device, and improvements in his short-term memory and clarity of thought processes. He continued to intermittently experience dreams as if looking through the device.

This has encouraged a large investment in new types of physical interaction artefacts (e.g. Wiimote™, Rock Band™, Kinect™). However, these artefacts still require custom interaction schemes to be developed for them, which critically limits the number of commercial videogames and multimedia applications that can benefit from those. Moreover, there is currently no agreement as to which factors better describe the impact that natural and complex multi-modal user interaction schemes have on users’ experiences—a gap in part created by the limitations in adapting this type of interaction to existing software. Thus, this paper presents a generic middleware framework for multi-modal natural interfaces which enables game-independent data acquisition that encourages further advancement on this domain. Furthermore, our framework can then redefine the interaction scheme of any software tool by mapping body poses and voice commands to traditional input means (keyboard and mouse). We have focused on digital games, where the use of physical interaction artefacts has become mainstream. The validation methods for this tool consisted of a series of increasing difficulty stress tests, with a total of 25 participants. Also, a pilot study was conducted on a further 16 subjects which demonstrated mainly positive impact of natural interfaces on player’s experience. The results supporting this were acquired when subjects played a complex commercial role-playing game whose mechanics were adapted using our framework; statistical tests on the obtained Fun ratings, along with subjective participant opinions indicate that this kind of natural interaction indeed has a significant impact on player’s experience and enjoyment. However, different impact patterns emerge from this analysis, which seem to fit with standing theories of player experience and immersion. © 2015 OpenInterface Association","Game controller; Kinect; Multi-modal; Natural interfaces; Pose recognition; Videogames",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922363894

Dewey and Bentley's theory of transaction, which views organism-in-environment-as-a-whole, enables the researcher to explore how actions-in-ongoing activities constitute and negotiate PE movement culture. Video footage from seven primary school PE lessons from a school in the West Midlands in the UK was analysed by focusing upon the ends-in-view of actions as they appeared through the educational content (what) and pedagogy (how) of the recorded PE experiences. Findings indicated that the movement culture within the school was a monoculture of looks-like-sport characterised by the privileging of the functional coordination of cooperative action. Three themes of pupils' and teachers' negotiation of the movement culture emerged U-turning, Knowing the game and Moving into and out of games. This movement culture required teachers to ensure pupils looked busy and reproduced cooperative looks-like-sport actions. In fulfilling this role, they struggled to negotiate between their knowledge of sport-for-real and directing pupils towards educational ends-in-view within games activities. Simply being good at sports was not a prerequisite for pupils' success in this movement culture. In order to re-actualise their knowledge of sport, pupils were required to negotiate the teacher's ‘how’ and ‘what’ by exploring what constituted cooperative actions within the spatial and social dimensions of the activities they were set. These findings suggest that if PE is to be more than just the reproduction of codified sport, careful adjustment and consideration of ends-in-view is of great importance. Without regard for the latter there is potential to create significant complexity for both teachers and pupils beyond that required by learning and performing sport. © 2015 The Author(s).

In broad terms, this purpose is tantamount to the stated purpose of Swedish PE in national steering documents. Crum contends, however, that physical educators do not prioritise learning, which is largely due to the different ‘movement cultures’ that constitute the PE lessons. This article explores how practice unfolds in movement cultures that are included in Swedish PE and their implications for teaching and learning in the subject. Some 30 (indoor) PE lessons in eight secondary schools in four cities throughout Sweden were video recorded. At ‘first glance’ these lessons indicated the prevalence of four logics of practice: a physical training logic, a sports logic, a sport technique logic and a dance logic. However, further analysis revealed that the teachers' and students' actions were not entirely in line with a logic of practice of training the body, winning the game, learning sporting skills or learning to dance. Instead, the PE practice largely unfolded as a ‘looks-like-practice’, where the purpose of teaching was blurred, and where any ‘planned introduction into movement culture’ was difficult to identify. In the final section, the authors discuss how physical activity logics can be recontextualised in a PE setting in order to emphasise the educational contribution of PE. © 2015 The Author(s).

While there are numerous procedures that attempt to do so, there is a great deal of controversy regarding their efficacy. Nonetheless, recent meta-analytic evidence shows consistent improvements across studies on lab-based tasks generalizing beyond the specific training effects (Au et al., 2014; Karbach and Verhaeghen, 2014), however, there is little research into howWMtraining aids participants in their daily life. Here we propose that incorporating design principles from the fields of Perceptual Learning (PL) and Computer Science might augment the efficacy ofWMtraining, and ultimately lead to greater learning and transfer. In particular, the field of PL has identified numerous mechanisms (including attention, reinforcement, multisensory facilitation and multi-stimulus training) that promote brain plasticity. Also, computer science has made great progress in the scientific approach to game design that can be used to create engaging environments for learning. We suggest that approaches integrating knowledge across these fields may lead to a more effective WM interventions and better reflect real world conditions. ©2015 Deveau, Jaeggi, Zordan, Phung and Seitz.","Brain training; Game desig; Perceptual learning; Video games; Working memory","Adams, E., (2009) Fundamentals of Game Design, , 2nd Edn.).

However, it has not been directly analysed whether strategic changes indeed take place in response to streakiness and whether they are effective with respect to winning games. The current work consists of an experimental study with 18 professional coaches and 20 players based on video sequences from National Basketball Association games, where the shown player displayed a streaky performance in half of the sequences. While coaches were asked to devise a defensive strategy after each viewed sequence, players had to assume the role of the shown player and decide whether to shoot or pass the ball. We find that coaches tended to increase the defensive pressure significantly more often on presumably hot players and thus make use of the hot-hand heuristic. Meanwhile, players chose to shoot more frequently in low-pressure and streaky situations but selected “pass” regardless of the previous performance when they faced increased defensive pressure. Assuming that a streaky player’s performance is indeed elevated during hot phases, hot-hand behaviour can be considered adaptive in certain situations as it led hot players to pass instead of shoot. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","decision-making; ecological rationality; fast and frugal heuristics; hot hand; sport; streak",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920836896

Instead of a monograph and the presentation of the history as lineal narrative, the work of the historian could be produced as a video game. Not historical fiction that sacrifices history for story and not a video game that sacrifices history for gameplay, but a video game that presents original research rivaling any great work of history, transforming readers, learners, and viewers into players interacting with history. The video game offers far greater potential for the creation and presentation of history than any other entertainment or interactive media. Although computer and video games may seem to be far removed from the historical narrative, both examine and form points of view about how cultures, economies, polities, and societies function. Ignoring the realities of budget and hiring a game design team, this article will imagine how historical research could be presented as a scholarly game. To explore these issues, the article analyzes key game mechanics and narrative structure in the popular history-based video games: the Assassin's Creed series, the Total War series, Rockstar Games' L.A. Noire and Red Dead Redemption, and Paradox Interactive's Crusader Kings II and Europa Universalis. It also examines Tracy Fullerton's experimental game Walden. In addition, it explores how the game design process could be applied to developing a scholarly game. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Historical scholarship; History-based video games; Scholarly games","Aarseth, E., (2004) Playing Research: Methodological Approaches to Game Analysis, , http://www.spilforskning.dk/gameapproaches/GameApproaches2.pdf, Accessed July 3; Antley, J., Going beyond the textual in history (2012) Journal of Digital Humanities, , http://www.journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-2/goingbeyond-the-textual-in-history-by-jeremy-antley/, Accessed July 3; Antley, J., Games and historical narratives (2012) Journal of Digital Humanities, , http://www.journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-2/games-and-historical-narratives-byjeremy-antley/; Apperley, T., Modding the historians' code: Historical verisimilitude and the counterfactual imagination (2013) Playing with the Past: Digital Games and the Simulation of History, , edited by Matthew Wilhelm Kapell, and Andrew B.

Politicians, the media, and public interest groups blamed violent video games for such unthinkable violence. This paper focuses on the way politicians describe the perceived violent video game problem and subsequent regulation policies. Seeing violent video game legislation as pseudo-agenda, a dramaturgical narrative analysis is conducted to interpret the post-Newtown narrative of the violent video game problem (and regulation prescriptions). This proposed legislative narrative (federal and state) is compared to the legislative narrative told prior to the US Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association. This Supreme Court decision established precedent on violent video game regulation efforts and related free speech concerns and found violent video games do not cause minors to be aggressive, nor can violent video games be regulated. As such, agenda items raised post-Newtown that mirror those ruled upon in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association constitute pseudo-agenda. Using Goffman’s dramaturgical analysis, the violent video game pseudo-agenda is seen as frontstage, while governmental economic interest in video game software companies is seen as backstage. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","crime legislation; dramaturgy; pseudo-agenda; Sandy Hook Elementary; school shooting; violent video games","(2007), http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2007/CommReports/SB1920_HD1_HSCR1459_.pdf(2007), http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2007/Bills/SB1920_.pdf(2007), http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&sessYr=2007&sessInd=0&billBody=H&billTyp=R&billNbr=0094&pn=2100Adachi, P.J.C., Willoughby, T., Demolishing the competition: The longitudinal link between competitive video games, competitive gambling, and aggression (2013) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 42, pp. 1090-1104; (2013), http://www.cga.ct.gov/2013/TOB/S/2013SB-00786-R00-SB.htm(2013), http://www.cga.ct.gov/2013/TOB/S/2013SB-00328-R01-SB.htm(2005), http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=09400HB4023&GA=94&SessionId=50&DocTypeId=HB&LegID=&DocNum=4023&GAID=8&Session=(2013), http://www.cga.ct.gov/2013/TOB/H/2013HB-05738-R00-HB.htm(2013), http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/13-14/bill/asm/ab_0251-0300/ab_255_bill_20130207_introduced.pdf(2009), http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/81R/billtext/pdf/SB01929I.pdf#navpanes=0(2013), http://www.malegislature.gov/Bills/188/House/H2511(2005), http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=294991(2013), http://open.nysenate.gov/legislation/bill/S308-2013(2011), http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&bn=A01099&term=2011&Summary=Y&Text=Y(2007), http://www.legis.delaware.gov/LIS/lis144.nsf/vwLegislation/HB+77/$file/legis.html?open(2005), http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2005-2006/billintroduced/Senate/pdf/2005-SIB-0416.pdfAnderson, C.A., Shibuya, A., Ihori, N., Nobuko, S., Edward, L., Bushman, B.J., Saleem, M., Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behavior in Eastern and Western countries: A meta-analytic review (2010) Psychological Bulletin, 136, pp. 151-173. , http://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com.echo.louisville.edu/sp-3.8.1a/ovidweb.cgi?&S=AJKBFPALPBDDMIOJNCOKJCJCAEIAAA00&Link+Set=S.sh.18.19.23.27%7c1%7csl_10; (2010) Literature review on the impact of playing violent video games on aggression, , Barton: Commonwealth of Australia; Blumer, H., (1969) Symbolic interactionism: Perspective and method, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall; (2011), http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/08-1448.pdfCobb, R.W., Elder, C.D., Issues and agendas (2013) Public policy essential readings, pp. 306-312. , Theodoulou S.

It's also one of preferential activities of adolescents. However, video gaming is associated to negative image and is sometimes considered as a problematic behavior. Thus, video games addiction becomes an object of the clinic. The avatar -. character from the video game embodied, directed and played by the player -. and the virtual world -. namely the environment of the avatar. - are the two essential components of any video game. The avatar would be a possibility to change different parts of self. In addition, depression is a comorbidity of addiction and cyberaddiction. Moreover, in reference of the self-discrepancy theory, depressive symptomatology should correspond to a significant gap between the actual self and the ideal self. The aim of this study is to provide an understanding of the addictive videogame behavior, in the light of the ""real"" and ""virtual"" self-perception and of the depressive symptomatology. Methods: This work was conducted with 74 adolescents aged from 11 to 14 years (Mage = 12.78 and SD = 0.921). The instruments used were the Game Addiction Scale, the Profile of self-perception - used with two different instructions in order to measure the perception about real and virtual self - and the Child Depression Inventory. Results: Regarding GAS scores from the 74 adolescents, 14 adolescents were considered as addicted to video games, and 15 adolescents presented a depressive symptomatology. The results showed that this ""depressive"" adolescents had a perception of real and virtual self less than others adolescents, their virtual self-perception tended to be greater than real self-perception. In addition, adolescents considered as addicted to video games presented a depressive symptomatology higher than other adolescents. Furthermore, virtual self-perception, self-perception and depressive symptomatology were explicative from videogame addictive process. Conclusions: These results lead us to question the video games addictive process as a functional restoration of identity, in order to reduce a major source of distress in adolescent. We consider it as the object of a ""re-construction of self"" in order to raise its self-perception and to reduce its suffering. In against part, a gap is created with the everyday environment, thus reinforcing the depressive symptomatology and addictive behavior. This addictive behavior would be a double process, both cause and consequence of the suffering of the subject, and wherein the failure of the self-image is a central axis. Nonetheless, questions arise concerning the relationship between the player and his avatar, but also on the impact of different formats of video games on this process. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Addictive behavior; Adolescence; Depressive symptomatology; Self-perception; Video game",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923872751

An international sample of 1,945 video game players completed a series of questionnaires online. While MMORPG players reported increased rates of problematic use and life interference compared with non-MMORPG players, there were no differences in levels of psychopathology.

Previous research has shown both positive and negative effects of video game play on attention, memory, and other cognitive abilities; however, little research has investigated its effects on executive functions other than working memory. Additionally, most studies have utilized predominantly male samples. The present study sought to examine the effects of active video game play on decision making, problem solving, and risk-taking. Two hundred twenty-eight undergraduate students (114 female) played one of five different video games (n = 91) or were part of a separate, no-game control condition (n = 137). Scores on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), and Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) were then compared. Following active video game play, participants decided more advantageously on the IGT, and made fewer errors and completed more categories on the WCST. No group differences emerged on the BART, and gender did not impact any dependent variables. It appears that active video game play may have positive effects on some executive functions with implications for real-world behavior.

For example, previous studies have found that playing video games is positively associated with aggressive behaviors and negatively associated with prosocial behaviors. However, very few studies have examined the mediating effects of personal characteristics between students playing video games and their social behaviors. Thus, using a sample of 1,242 seventh, eighth, and ninth grade Korean students, the authors aimed to determine how playing video games is related to aggressive and prosocial behaviors and whether the emotional competencies of adolescents, such as empathy, emotional regulation, and behavioral self-control, mediate this relationship. The results indicated that violent video games have a significant direct effect on aggressive behaviors, and a significant indirect effect on prosocial behaviors. Specifically, empathy and behavioral self-control were found to mediate the relation between playing violent video games and prosocial behaviors. These results suggest different prevention and intervention approaches to reduce aggressive behaviors and increase prosocial behaviors in students exposed to violent video games.

These relationships between behavioral addictions could be said to result especially from Internet use. It is seen that problematic or excessive use of the Internet not only results in Internet addiction but also leads to and contributes to such other behavioral addictions as video game addiction. The present study examined the associations in related literature with the relationships between video game and Internet addictions and aimed at determining the correlations between video game and Internet addictions. Also, the study further focused on whether the symptom of tolerance occurred in all conditions or not. In the study, correlational research was used. The study was carried out with 200 students from a high school located in the Eastern part of Turkey. Video Game Addiction Questionnaire and Internet Addiction Scale were used to collect the research data. For the analysis of the data, descriptive statistics, TwoStep Cluster Analysis, correlation analysis and Independent Samples t-Test were applied. Consequently, it was found that there was a strong correlation between video game addiction and Internet addiction. Also, not in all conditions can tolerance be said to be among the symptoms of video game addiction or Internet addiction. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Three hundred eighty-four Chinese adolescents aged 14-18yr (148 males and 236 females) were analyzed. Anthropometric measurements were obtained using standard procedures. Total body and regional BMD were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Duration of playing video games, defined as hours per day, was measured by a self-report questionnaire. We examined the association between duration of playing video games and BMD using multiple linear regression analysis. After adjustment for age, sex, pubertal stage, parental education, body mass index, adolescents with longer video game duration were more likely to have lower legs, trunk, pelvic, spine, and total BMD (p < 0.05). We concluded that duration of video game was negatively associated with BMD in Chinese adolescents. These findings provide support for reducing duration of playing video games as a possible means to increase BMD in adolescents. Future research is needed to elucidate the underlined mechanisms linking playing video games and osteoporosis. © 2015 The International Society for Clinical Densitometry.","Bone mineral density; Chinese adolescents; Playing video games","Landin, L.A., Fracture patterns in children.

Material and Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study (Canadian Task Force Classification II-1) was conducted at a medical university training center. The study subjects were medical students who currently played video games (Group I) and those who had not played video games in the last 2 years (Group II). The robotic skills of both groups were assessed using simulation. Results: Twenty-two students enrolled in this study; however, only 21 completed it. The median age of the participants was 23 (22-24) years and 24 (23-26) years in Groups I and II, respectively. Among the participants, 15 (71.4%) were male and 6 (28.5%) were female, and 90.4% of the students started playing video games in primary school. When the 2 groups were compared according to the completion time of each exercise, Group I finished more quickly than Group II in the Peg Board-1 exercise (p>0.05), whereas Group II had better results in 3 exercises including Pick and Place, Ring and Rail, and Thread the Rings-1. However, none of the differences were found to be statistically significant (p>.05), and according to the overall scores based on the time to complete exercises, economy of motion, instrument collision, use of excessive instrument force, instruments out of view, and master workspace range, the scores were not statistically different between Groups I and II (p>.05). Conclusion: According to the basic robotic simulation exercise results, there was no difference between medical students who used to play video games and those who still played video games. Studies evaluating baseline visuospatial skills with larger sample sizes are needed. © 2015 by the Turkish-German Gynecological Education and Research Foundation.","Education; Medical students; Robotic simulation; Video games","Borahay, M.A., Haver, M.C., Eastham, B., Patel, P.R., Kilic, G.S., Modular Comparison of Laparoscopic and Robotic Simulation Platforms in Residency Training: A Randomized Trial (2013) J Minim Invasive Gynecol, 20, pp. 871-879. , [CrossRef]; Lynch, J., Aughwane, P., Hammond, T.M., Video games and surgical ability: A literature review (2010) J Surg Educ, 67, pp. 184-189. , [CrossRef]; Griffith, J.L., Voloschin, P., Gibb, G.D., Bailey, J.R., Differences in eye-hand motor coordination of video-game users and non-users (1983) Percept Mot Skills, 57, pp. 155-158. , [CrossRef]; Nielsen, U., Dahl, R., White, R.F., Grandjean, P., Computer assisted neuropsychological testing of children (1998) Ugeskr Laeger, 160, pp. 3557-3561; Harper, J.D., Kaiser, S., Ebrahimi, K., Lamberton, G.R., Hadley, H.R., Ruckle, H.C., Baldwin, D.D., Prior video game exposure does not enhance robotic surgical performance (2007) J Endourol, 21. , [CrossRef]; Giannotti, D., Patrizi, G., Di Rocco, G., Vestri, A.R., Semproni, C.P., Fiengo, L., Play to become a surgeon: Impact of Nintendo Wii training on laparoscopic skills (2013) Plos One, 8. , [CrossRef]; Vaccaro, C.M., Crisp, C.C., Fellner, A.N., Jackson, C., Kleeman, S.D., Pavelka, J., Robotic virtual reality simulation plus standard robotic orientation versus standard robotic orientation alone: A randomized controlled trial (2013) Female Pelvic Med Reconstr Surg, 19, pp. 266-270. , [CrossRef]; Adams, B.J., Margaron, F., Kaplan, B.J., Comparing video games and laparoscopic simulators in the development of laparoscopic skills in surgical residents (2012) J Surg Educ, 69, pp. 714-717. , [CrossRef]; Kilic, G.S., Walsh, T.M., Borahay, M., Zeybek, B., Wen, M., Breitkopf, D., Effect of residents’ previous laparoscopic surgery experience on initial robotic suturing experience (2012) ISRN Obstet Gynecol, 2012. , [CrossRef]; Liss, M.A., Abdelshehid, C., Quach, S., Lusch, A., Graversen, J., Landman, J., McDougall, E.M., Validation, correlation, and comparison of the da Vinci trainer and the daVinci surgical skills simulator using the Mimic software for urologic robotic surgical education (2012) J Endourol, 26, pp. 1629-1634. , [CrossRef]; Kolozsvari, N.O., Alib, A., Kaneva, P., Cao, J., Vassiliou, M.C., Fried, G.M., Feldman, L.S., Sex is not everything: The role of gender in early performance of a fundamental laparoscopic skill (2011) Surg Endosc, 25, pp. 1037-1042. , [CrossRef]; Shane, M.D., Pettitt, B.J., Morgenthal, C.B., Smith, C.D., Should surgical novices trade their retractors for joysticks?

The present research offers a new scale for player motivations and then examines its validity across two distinct gaming genres and cultures, drawing from server-side data combined with survey data of 18,627 players of the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena League of Legends and 18,819 players of the Chinese Massively Multiplayer Online Game Chevalier's Romance Online 3. Six types of player motivations were found: socializer, completionist, competitor, escapist, story-driven, and smarty-pants. Consistent with previous research on player motivations, this typology offers new insights into why people play video games and how player motivations can be used to infer players' in-game behaviors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants played a basketball video game with a helpful or unhelpful teammate against an ostensible opposing team. Participants in the control condition did not play a video game with their teammate. Participants then engaged in a one-shot simultaneous or sequential prisoner's dilemma game with their teammate and an opposing team member. In line with Bounded Generalized Reciprocity, donations to teammates were influenced by expectations of others to reciprocate pro-social behaviors. Specifically, playing with a helpful teammate confirmed expectations of in-group members to reciprocate pro-social behaviors and led to increases in pro-social behaviors between teammates. Playing with an unhelpful teammate disconfirmed expectations of in-group members to reciprocate pro-social behaviors and led to decreases in pro-social behaviors between teammates. Interestingly, playing with a helpful teammate increased participants' donation to out-group members even though participants did not expect them to reciprocate. The current study emphasizes the importance of pro-social reciprocity expectations in predicting people's pro-social behaviors and the impact cooperative video game play can have on such expectations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, while the educational utilities of this medium of communication have been researched in several occasions, its transmission of values has not been analysed in depth. Method: A correlational approach based on a survey questionnaire has been used in order to examine video game consumption habits among adolescents (N=110). In addition, the content of the video games used the most by research participants was subjected to analysis. Results and conclusions: The study has shown that there are significant differences in video game usage among male and female adolescents, and that there are no significant differences according to age groups. The study also confirmed that video games are, indeed, transmitters of certain values. © 2015, Revista Latina de Comunicación Social.

[Subjects and Methods] Twenty healthy young adults without prior experience of driving power wheelchairs were recruited. Four commercially available video games were used as training programs to practice joystick control in catching falling objects, crossing a river, tracing the route while floating on a river, and navigating through a garden maze. An indoor power wheelchair driving test, including straight lines, and right and left turns, was completed before and after the video game practice, during which electromyographic signals of the upper limbs were recorded. The paired t-test was used to compare the differences in driving performance and muscle activities before and after the intervention.

Due to the competitive industry and high demand for novelty in today's world, gaming has now become a valuable and stimulating research setting for HCI researchers to study its interface and interaction design, input devices, graphical user interface, social communication and development processes. Video games have advanced technologically and visually, and seem to demand greater levels of engagement from their users. The degree of interaction designed into a game is vital to effectively generate a constructive or destructive player (user) experience. The success of the gaming industry has bred a desire to accurately understand and measure player responses to video gaming, thus making video games a perfect test-bed for HCI explorations. This paper will attempt to address and review the literature on affective user-centered design principles, elements and methodologies that are applicable in video games. © 2014 IEEE.","affective design; affective gaming; user-centered design; video games","Gilleade, K.M., Dix, A., Using frustration in the design of adaptive videogames (2004) Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGCHI International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology, pp. 228-232; Hudlicka, E., Affective game engines: Motivation and requirements (2009) Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Foundations of Digital Games, pp. 299-306; Mahlke, S., Understanding users' experience of interaction (2005) Proceedings of the 2005 Annual Conference on European Association of Cognitive Ergonomics, pp. 251-254; Boehner, K., Affect: From information to interaction (2005) Proceedings of the 4th Decennial Conference on Critical Computing, pp. 59-68; Gilleade, K.M., Affective videogames and modes of affective gaming: Assist me, challenge me, emote me (2005) Proceedings of DIGRA 2005 Conference on Changing Views: Worlds in Play, 8, pp. 547-554; Picard, R.W., Toward computers that recognize and respond to user emotion (2000) IBM Systems Journal, 39 (3-4), pp. 705-719; Pagulayan, R.J., User-centred design in games (2002) The Human-Computer Interaction Handbook: Fundamentals, Evolving Technologies and Emerging Applications, pp. 883-906. , J.

In two experiments, we used a virtual Morris Water Maze (VMWM) with and without proximal cues to measure spatial learning as a total of 82 video game experts and novices completed a search task across several trials. We measured the participants’ path lengths and tested their mental rotation abilities. The results showed that proximal cues improved overall performance. With no visible cues, experts exhibited better performance than novices when their memory for the general location of the platform was probed. With visible cues, video game experts travelled shorter path lengths than novices to the exact location of the hidden platform. Mental rotation ability correlated with overall maze performance only when no cues were visible, and only novices’ scores correlated with path length in this condition. These studies showed that the VMWM is a useful paradigm in examining how past video game experience influences human spatial cognition. © 2015 Intellect Ltd Article.","Mental rotation; Spatial learning;

Method: Participants (N = 135) were randomly assigned to play a violent video game or a nonviolent video game. The participants' PDRs were then recorded while they were exposed to pictures of alleged victims of violence displayed in negative, neutral, and positive contexts. A competitive reaction time task was also used to measure aggression. Results: Participants in the violent game condition demonstrated both a lower PDR to the victims of violence in a negative circumstances and greater aggression than participants in the nonviolent game condition. Lower PDR to victims displayed in negative context mediated the relationship between violent game play and aggression. Conclusion: The negative effects of playing violent games are a societal concern. Our results indicate that a single violent gaming session can reduce the player's involuntary PDRs to pictures of victimized people in negative context and increase participant aggression, a new relevant finding that should encourage further research in this area. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","aggressive behavior; emotional desensitization; pupillometry; victims of violence; violent video games","(2005) Resolution on Violence in Video Games and Interactive Media, , http://www.apa.org/about/policy/interactive-media.pdf, American Psychological Association.

Popular games like Rock Band and Karaoke Revolutions rate players' singing based on the correctness of the frequency of their sung response. Players are motivated to improve their scores each time they play. In this experiment, I tested undergraduate non-musicians' (N = 33) pitch-matching ability before and after playing one of these games for 10 minutes. Acoustical analysis revealed a significant difference between pre-and post-test scores. These data suggest that playing the video game for 10 minutes may have produced an immediate, observable change in pitch-matching scores. Music teachers regularly teach students how to develop pitch-matching skills. Games like the one used in this study may add to the tools used in that process. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.","Feedback; independent learning; pitch-matching; video games","Demorest, S.M., Clements, A., Factors influencing the pitch-matching of junior high boys (2007) Journal of Research in Music Education, 55 (3), pp. 190-203; Denis, G., Jouvelot, P., Building the case for video games in music education (2004) Second International Computer Game and Technology Workshop, pp. 156-161. , http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary; Denis, G., Jouvelot, P., Motivation-driven educational game design: Applying best practices to music education (2005) Proceedings of the 2005 ACM SIGCHI International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology, pp. 462-465. , edited by Newton Lee New York: ACM; Gower, L., McDowall, J., Interactive music video games and children's musical development (2012) British Journal of Music Education, 29 (1), pp. 91-105; Hoppe, D., Sadakata, M., Desain, P., Development of real-time visual feedback assistance in singing training: A review computer-assisted singing training (2006) Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 22 (4), pp. 308-316; (2008) Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol Encore [Playstation. 2 Game], , Tokyo: Konami; Karpinski, G.S., (2000) Aural Skills Acquisition: The Development of Listening, Reading, and Performing Skills in College-level Musicians, , Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press; Liao, M.-Y., The effects of gesture use on young children's pitch accuracy for singing tonal patterns (2008) International Journal of Music Education, 26 (3), pp. 197-211; Mang, E., The effects of age, gender and language on children's singing competency (2006) British Journal of Music Education, 23 (2), pp. 161-174; Nardo, R., Got Rhythm ?

These systems, however, are based on questionable principles, for two reasons. First, analyzing the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) and the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) from a pedagogical point of view, one cannot but notice that they are inherently flawed by contradictions and confusion of different perspectives. Second, these contradictions increase the difficulty for parents who buy video games to understand the rating. This is a considerable drawback, as parents and child caregivers should be the primary targets of such rating systems. This article offers a critical examination of the European PEGI and the North American ESRB rating systems, and, starting from this analysis, suggests improvements that could make video game rating systems more appropriate in terms of their function as parental guidance. © SAGE Publications 2014.","Children's protection; ESRB; PEGI; Rating; Video game","Andreoletti, M., The video game: Questions, taxonomies, similitudes (2010) Research on Education and Media, 1, pp. 79-100; Hobbs, R., (2010) Digital and Media Literacy: A Plan of Action, , Washington, DC: The Aspen Institute;; (2014) Video Game Content Rating System; Brekke, A., Lepre, C., (2007) Burned by 'Hot Coffee'?

A specific coding was developed in order to design an auditory version of a vision-based simple video game involving moving objects. We investigated the learning process of participants in this purely auditory game and the influence of the following factors on performance: gender, level of practice in video games and three cognitive abilities, namely, mental rotation, visual attention and spatial perception. The results revealed that occasional and regular players' level of performance significantly improved with practice, whereas those of nonplayers did not. They also revealed a significant influence of gender. Scores in the mental rotation test was found to be correlated only with the final level of performance.

Previous research has found that individual (e.g., personality) differences influence gaming preferences (Zammitto, 2001) and we sought to extend these findings to the domain of career interests. In addition, we examined the potential moderating role of gender. Since researchers have found that gender disparities in spatial attention can be reduced by playing certain types of video games (Feng, Spence, & Pratt, 2007), and it has been demonstrated that spatial ability is an important predictor of success in careers where women are typically underrepresented (Blickenstaff, 2005), we predicted that women with a preference for these types of games (versus a general preference) may have more interest in these careers. We found that gaming motivations were differentially associated with career interests.

In line with previous work, we suggest that transfer is dependent upon common demands between the game and transfer task. In the current study, participants played one of four action games with varying speed, visual, and attentional demands for 20 h. We examined whether training enhanced performance for attentional blink, selective attention, attending to multiple items, visual search and auditory detection. Non-gamers who played the game (Modern Combat) with the highest demands showed transfer to tasks of attentional blink and attending to multiple items. The game (MGS Touch) with fewer attentional demands also decreased attentional blink, but to a lesser degree. Other games failed to show transfer, despite having many action game characteristics but at a reduced intensity. The results support the common demands hypothesis. © 2015 Oei and Patterson.","Action video games; Selective attention; Training; Transfer","Achtman, R.L., Green, C.S., Bavelier, D., Video games as a tool to train visual skills (2008) Restor.

By charting the implications of this burgeoning economic model, the article contributes to scholarship concerning video game production and intervenes within more specific discussions concerning the role of the player within development. The article’s case study, which draws from evidence of production concerning multiple Kickstarter projects, is organised into two sections.

Two groups of cognitively normal older adults participated in both the posttraining (posttest) and the present follow-up study, the experimental group who received training and the control group who attended several meetings with the research team during the study but did not receive training. Groups were similar at baseline on demographics, vocabulary, global cognition, and depression status. Significant improvements in the trained group, and no variation in the control group had been previously found at posttest, in processing speed, attention and visual recognition memory, as well as in two dimensions of subjective wellbeing. In the current study, improvement from baseline to 3 months follow-up was found only in wellbeing (Affection and Assertivity dimensions) in the trained group whereas there was no change in the control group. Previous significant improvements in processing speed, attention and spatial memory become nonsignificant after the 3-month interval. Training older adults with non-action video games enhanced aspects of cognition just after training but this effect disappeared after a 3-month no-contact follow-up period. Cognitive plasticity can be induced in older adults by training, but to maintain the benefits periodic boosting sessions would be necessary. © 2015 Ballesteros, Mayas, Prieto, Barrera, González, Romero, Reales and Waterworth.","Brain plasticity; Clinical trial; Cognitive aging; Non-action video games; Wellbeing","Ackerman, P.L., Kanfer, R., Calderwood, C., Use it or lose it?

The findings indicate that repeated play leads to habituation in both biophysiological and self-report responses. Notably, evidence of generalization is more apparent in the biophysiological data. The results are discussed in terms of: (1) implications for game developers and players, (2) implications for game researchers, (3) current conceptual ambiguity between cross-sectional and longitudinal models, and (4) the appropriateness of utilizing self-report measures in longitudinal studies examining arousal. © 2015 National Communication Association.","Arousal; Blood Pressure; Cardiovascular Activity; Media Effects; Video Games","Anderson, C.A., An update on the effects of playing violent video games (2004) Journal of Adolescence, 27 (1), pp. 113-122; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: A meta-analytic review of the scientific literature (2001) Psychological Science, 12, pp. 353-359; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Human aggression (2002) Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 27-51; Anderson, C.A., Shibuya, A., Ihori, N., Swing, E.L., Bushman, B.J., Sakamoto, A., Saleem, M., Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behavior in Eastern and Western countries: A meta-analytic review (2010) Psychological Bulletin, 136, pp. 151-173; Ballard, M.E., Hamby, R.H., Panee, C.D., Nivens, E.E., Repeated exposure to video game play results in decreased blood pressure responding (2006) Media Psychology, 8, pp. 323-341; Bartholow, B.D., Bushman, B.J., Sestir, M.A., Chronic violent video game exposure and desensitization to violence: Behavioral and event-related brain potential data (2006) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 42, pp. 532-539; Bowman, N.D., Tamborini, R., In the mood to game:” Selective exposure and mood management processes in computer game play (2013) New Media & Society, , http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/09/19/1461444813504274.abstract, Advance online publication.

This article addresses this gap through a critical deployment of the concept of precarity and its multiform nature experienced by game testers. Drawing on Harry Braverman's concept of ""degradation of labor,"" I aim to contribute to media labor literature by introducing the concept of ""degradation of fun,"" where testers are alienated from play and forced to develop instrumental and selective ways of play. I make the argument that as opposed to popular representations, game testing is a decidedly precarious labor, due to its assumed low-skill status, and because of the existence of a large reserve army of labor, which depresses the wages and renders testers expendable. Ultimately, the ""immateriality"" and joy of testing as labor comes with material physical and bodily pains, and sentiments of second-class citizenship. © The Author(s) 2014.","creative economy; immaterial labor; political economy; precarity; production studies; video game industry","Theodore, A., Max, H., (1944) Cultural Theory: An Anthology, pp. 40-53. , Szeman Imre Kaposy Timothy, ed.

We measured electromyographic (EMG) activity over the corrugator supercilii muscle while participants viewed pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant pictures. Potential group differences concerning valence-concordant expressivity may arise from differences concerning the participants' emotional reactivity. To control for such differences, we concomitantly measured skin conductance response (SCR) and, in a separate affect misattribution procedure (AMP), valence transfer from the same set of stimuli. Importantly, we found attenuated valence-concordant EMG activity over the corrugator supercilii muscle in VGP experts compared to nonexperts, but no differences were evident concerning SCR or valence transfer in the AMP. The findings suggest that expertise in VGP is particularly associated with reduced valence-concordant emotional expressivity. © 2014 Society for Psychophysiological Research.","EMG; Emotional expressivity; IAPS; Valence; Video game playing","Anderson, C.A., Gentile, D.A., Buckley, K.E., (2007) Violent video game effects on children and adolescents: Theory, research, and public policy.

This study is the first to examine the effect of a 1-h AVG play on lean and obese adolescents' energy expenditure. Methods: Body composition and aerobic fitness were assessed in 19 obese and 12 lean adolescent boys (12-15 years old). Participants performed a 1-h AVG session (Kinect Sports technology) while wearing a portable indirect calorimeter (K4b2) to assess their energy expenditure and heart rate. Results: Body weight (91.0±9.5 vs. 58.5±12.4kg), body mass index (32.2±3.1 vs. 20.3±1.6kgm-2) and body fat (38.1±2.7 vs. 13.4±3.9%) were significantly higher in obese adolescents (P<0.001). Absolute energy expenditure was significantly higher in obese (P<0.05) but not when corrected for body composition. Maximal heart rate reached during AVG was significantly higher in lean adolescents (190±25 vs. 183±28bpm, P<0.05). Time spent between 3 and 6 METs (Metabolic Equivalent Task) was not different between groups but time spent above 6 METs was higher in lean adolescents (P<0.05). Conclusion: Although lean and obese adolescent boys experienced similar energy expenditure relative to their body size during a 1-h Kinect AVG session, lean adolescents spent more time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. © 2015 World Obesity.","Active video game; Adolescents; Energy expenditure; Exercise intensity; Paediatric obesity",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927670006

However, the games used in previous research to reach these conclusions often confound violence with other game features, such as game difficulty. Here, participants were randomly assigned to play one of four versions of a video game, wherein content (violent or not) and difficulty (easy or difficult) were orthogonally manipulated, prior to completing a cognitive control task. Results showed that playing a difficult video game produced decrements in cognitive control, but only if the game was perceived to be difficult, and that perceptions of game difficulty may mediate this relationship. Game content, by comparison, had no effect on cognitive control. Findings are discussed in terms of understanding effects of difficult games on cognitive processes that have important implications for social behavior. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The method exploits the dynamic architecture of the Scalable Video Coding extension of the H.264 standard, along with the diversity that OFDMA networks provide. We use a game-theoretic Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) framework to ensure that each user receives the minimum video quality requirements, while maintaining fairness over the cognitive radio system. An optimization problem is formulated, where the objective is the maximization of the Nash product while minimizing the waste of resources. The problem is solved by using a Swarm Intelligence optimizer, namely Particle Swarm Optimization. Due to the high dimensionality of the problem, we also introduce a dimension-reduction technique. Our experimental results demonstrate the fairness imposed by the employed NBS framework. © 2015 SPIE-IS&T.","Cognitive radio; fairness; Game Theory; Nash Bargaining Solution; OFDMA; Particle Swarm Optimization; resource allocation; scalable video coding","Haykin, S., Cognitive radio: Brain-empowered wireless communications (2005) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 23, pp. 201-220. , (February); Zhang, K.H.W., Letaief, K., Opportunistic spectrum sharing in cognitive MIMO wireless networks (2009) IEEE Trans. on Wireless Communications, 8, pp. 4098-4109. , (August); Yin, H., Alamouti, S., OFDMA: A broadband wireless access technology (2006) Sarnoff Symposium, pp. 1-4. , IEEE; Bocus, M.Z., Coon, J.P., Canagarajah, C.N., Armour, S., Doufexi, A., McGeehan, J.P., Persubcarrier antenna selection for H.264 MGS/CGS video transmission over cognitive radio networks (2012) IEEE Trans. on Veh.

The purpose of the study was to examine physiological predictors of the development of PVGU across adolescence. Methods The article involves a 1-year longitudinal study across midadolescence. Participants were 374 adolescents and their parents from a large metropolitan area in the Northwest United States. PVGU was assessed via questionnaire, as were a number of control variables. A number of physiological indicators including respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and galvanic skin conductance (indices of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity, respectively) were measured during baseline, a cognitively stimulating task (Rubik's cube), and a family problem-solving task. Results Less RSA withdrawal to a cognitively simulating task was related to greater pathologic video game symptoms, but less RSA withdrawal to a family problem-solving task was associated with the presence of pathologic video game symptoms (p <.05). For girls only, galvanic skin conductance activation during the family problem solving was related to greater pathologic video game symptoms (p <.01). Conclusions These findings suggest that adolescents who do not find cognitive tasks stimulating physiologically have a greater severity of PVGU. Additionally, adolescents who show physiological signs of stress in a family task were more likely to have PVGU symptoms and only girls have more severe PVGU levels. This study is the first to show that physiological indicators predict PVGU over time in adolescence and has important implications regarding the prevention and treatment of PVGU in adolescence. © 2015 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.","Adolescence; Computer game; Internet addiction; Media; Pathologic; Physiology; Video game","Generation M2: Media in the Lives of 8- to 18-Year-Olds Fed Commun Forum, , http://www.kff.org/entmedia/mh012010pkg.cfm, Kaiser Family Foundation Accessed March 19, 2013; Greitemeyer, T., Osswald, S., Effects of prosocial video games on prosocial behavior (2010) J Pers Soc Psychol, 98, pp. 211-221; Anderson, C.A., Shibuya, A., Ihori, N., Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behavior in eastern and western countries: A meta-analytic review (2010) Psychol Bull, 136, pp. 151-173; Greitemeyer, T., Mügge, D., Video games do affect social outcomes: A meta-analytic review of the effects of violent and prosocial video game play (2014) Pers Soc Psychol Bull, 40, pp. 578-589; Gentile, D.A., Coyne, S.M., Bricolo, F., Pathological technology addictions: A review of the literature and a diagnosis paradigm (2013) The Oxford Handbook of Media Psychology, pp. 382-402. , K.

Accordingly, a free-association questionnaire was used after participants played the game The Graveyard. The associative method was paired with item hierarchization and clustering techniques using a structural approach. The data were analyzed using mixed methods (frequency analysis, semantic weight, and categorical clustering). Additionally, a cluster analysis was conducted to determine connections between representations. Afterward, categories were compared with the representations the game designers wanted to transmit to the players. The results of the research confirmed the possibility of accessing people's social representations using a video game as stimulus. Cluster analyses depicted that these representations were emotionally linked and socially shared among the players without regard to age or gender. The relation with the designers' representations about the game was found to be not significant. © SAGE Publications 2014.","Art games; Communication; Emotion; Social representations; Video games","Abrudan, E., Prundaru, G., Social representations and ideologies in digital games (2009) Journal of Media Research, 5, pp. 31-41; Araya, S., Las Representaciones Sociales: Ejes Teóricos para su Discusión (2002) Cuaderno de Ciencias Sociales, 127; Bauer, M.W., Gaskell, G., Social representations theory: A progressive research programme for social psychology (2008) Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, 38, pp. 335-353; Behrens, J., Yu, C.-H., (2003) Handbook of Psychology: Research Methods in Psychology, pp. 33-63. , Weiner I.

However, the impact of violent video games is a topic of heated debate, relying on scientific literature supporting contradictory conclusions. In summary, violent video games obviously induce more aggressive thoughts and emotions, and an increase in violent behavior in the short term and long term. However, it seems that the use of violent video games is not correlated with an increase in crime. We assume that this paradox can be explained by the complexity of the concept of acting out, and the barriers that exist between the feeling of an individual and their actions.","Aggression; Behaviour; Crime; Influence; Literature review; Video games; Violence","Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: A metaanalytic review of the scientific literature (2001) Psychological Science, 12, pp. 353-359; Anderson, C.A., Dill, K.E., Video games and aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behavior in the laboratory and in life (2000) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78, p. 772; Anderson, C.A., Gentile, D.A., Buckley, K.E., (2007) Violent Video Game Effects on Children and Adolescents: Theory, Research, and Public Policy: Theory, Research, and Public Policy, , New york (USA) : Oxford University Press; Anderson, C.A., Shibuya, A., Ihori, N., Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behavior in Eastern and Western countries: A meta-analytic review (2010) Psychological Bulletin, 136, pp. 151-173; Anderson, C.C.A., An update on the effects of playing violent video games (2004) Journal of Adolescence, 27, pp. 113-122. , London, England; Bensley, L., Van Eenwyk, J., Video games and real-life aggression: Review of the literature (2001) Journal of Adolescent Health, 29, pp. 244-257. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1054-139X(01)00239-7; Bourgoin, V., Les dispositions françaises en faveur du jeu vidéo (2013) Géoéconomie, 4, pp. 65-72; Buchman, D.D., Funk, J.B., Video and computer games in the'90s: Children's time commitment & game preference (1996) Children Today, 24, pp. 12-15. , Washington; Bushman, B.J., Huesmann, L.R., Short-term and long-term effects of violent media on aggression in children and adults (2006) Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, 160, p. 348; Carnagey, N.L., Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., The effect of video game violence on physiological desensitization to reallife violence (2007) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 43, pp. 489-496; Chambers, J.H., Ascione, F.R., The effects of prosocial and aggressive videogames on children's donating and helping (1987) The Journal of Genetic Psychology, 148, pp. 499-505; Christakis, D.A., Ebel, B.E., Rivara, F.P., Zimmerman, F.J., Television, video, and computer game usage in children under 11 years of age (2004) The Journal of Pediatrics, 145, pp. 652-656; Cunningham, S., Engelstätter, B., Ward, M., Understanding the effects of violent video games on violent crime (2011) ZEW-Centre for European Economic Research Discussion Paper, pp. 11-042; Dahl, G., DellaVigna, S., Does movie violence increase violent crime?

However, this view ignores two core findings of the economic systems literature: first, that mobility patterns are institutional microsystems that need to be complementary to other institutions in the labour market; and second, that new industries may be characterised by incremental and complex innovation. Based on these considerations, we ask how mobility affects innovation in the video games industry in the US and Japan. We find that inter-firm mobility is beneficial for innovation in the US, but has negative effects in Japan. We further find that inter-functional mobility is beneficial for innovation in both countries. Our analysis is based on career histories from the video games industry in the US and Japan.

Although studies have identified media violence in general and violent video gaming in particular as significant predictors of aggressive behavior, exposure to violent video games has been largely omitted from the risk factor literature on delinquent behavior. This cross-sectional study therefore investigates the relationship between violent video game play and adolescents' delinquent behavior using a risk factor approach. An online survey was completed by 3,372 Flemish adolescents, aged 12-18 years old. Data were analyzed by means of negative binomial regression modelling. Results indicated a significant contribution of violent video games in delinquent behavior over and beyond multiple known risk variables (peer delinquency, sensation seeking, prior victimization, and alienation). Moreover, the final model that incorporated the gaming genres proved to be significantly better than the model without the gaming genres. Results provided support for a cumulative and multiplicative risk model for delinquent behavior. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Adolescents; Delinquency; Risk factor; Video gaming; Violence",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926442125

The theoretical section briefly overviews conceptual metaphor theory, the TIME IS SPACE/MOTION metaphor, multimodality, CMT in video games, time in video games, and several studies related to the game. The main section investigates Braid so as to evaluate the ways in which the TIME IS SPACE/MOTION metaphor operates within each of the game worlds and how this affects the narrative and the gameplay. The complex, unconventional relations existing among time, space, motion, and causality result in a unique coupling between the narrative and the use of the TIME IS SPACE/MOTION metaphor. © The Author(s) 2014.","causality; cognition; gameplay; motion; narrative; space; time; video gaming","Aarseth, E., Aporia and epiphany in doom and ""the Speaking Clock"": The temporality of ergodic art (1999) Cyberspace Textuality, pp. 31-41. , M.-L.

This analysis considers how the games in the Ravenhearst trilogy both reinforce and complicate expectations of women gamers through repurposing the gothic romance. While the series does not market itself exclusively to women, the narrative specifically places the player in the subject position that implies a heterosexual female. By tapping into gothic genre expectations the games help to marginalize the player within the larger scope of video games. The games play with gothic storytelling style, yet push against many traditional conventions of the genre, illustrating how digital spaces have begun to rewrite traditional narrative conventions, but still maintain their gendered affectations. Through gaming, the gothic romance premise is reproduced, but ultimately shifts the player from the role of an onlooker to the subject position of victimized protagonist. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","casual games; gothic romance; hidden object games; Ravenhearst; women and gaming","Birkhead, E., (1921) The Tale of Terror, , New York: EP Dutton & Company; Blodgett, B., Salter, A., Hearing 'lady game creators' tweet: #1reasonwhy, women and online discourse in the game development community (2013) Selected Papers of Internet Research, 3. , http://spir.aoir.org/index.php/spir/article/view/694, Accessed December 4, 2013; Bogost, I., (2007) Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Botting, F., (1996) Gothic, , London and New York: Routledge; Cassell, J., Jenkins, H., (1998) From Barbie to Mortal Kombat: Gender and Computer Games, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; (2007) Casual Games Market Report 2007, , http://issuu.com/casualconnect/docs/casualgamesmarketreport-2007/6?e=2336319/1145366, CASUAL GAMES ASSOCIATION.

Within the video game industry, massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) have demonstrated unprecedented growth in recent years by attracting more than 50 million consumers who spend in excess of $12. billion annually. Yet, marketing researchers have not paid sufficient attention toward understanding consumption behaviors exhibited by MMORPG players. Drawing from research on MMORPGs, social identity theory, and online communities, this study examines the antecedents and consumption-related outcomes of players' (1) identification with MMORPGs and (2) identification with the MMORPG community. Analysis of data collected from 970 MMORPG players indicates that online games are socially driven and, although attachment with games is important, the relationships forged with fellow players drive consumption behaviors. Theoretical and managerial implications as well as limitations and directions for future research are offered. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Identification; MMORPGs; Online consumption communities; Online multiplayer games; Social identity theory","Algesheimer, R., Dholakia, U., Hermann, A., Interplay between brand and brand community: Evidence from European car clubs (2005) Journal of Marketing, 69 (3), pp. 19-34; Amaral, M., Monteiro, M., To be without being seen: Computer-mediated communication and social identity management (2002) Small Group Research, 33 (5), pp. 575-589; Ang, C.S., Zaphiris, P., Social roles of players in MMORPG guilds: A social network analytic perspective (2010) Information, Communication & Society, 13 (4), pp. 592-614; Ang, C.S., Zaphiris, P., Mahmood, S., A model of cognitive loads in massively multiplayer online role playing games (2007) Interacting with Computers, 19 (2), pp. 167-179; Armstrong, J.S., Overton, T.S., Estimating nonresponse bias in mail surveys (1977) Journal of Marketing Research, 14 (3); Ashforth, B.E., Johnson, S.A., Which hat to wear?

Cyberlearning through game-based, metaphor-enhanced learning objects (CyGaMEs) design and embedded assessment quantify player behavior to study knowledge discovery and application. CyGaMEs is grounded by analogical reasoning theory, cognitive task analysis and knowledge representation. A construct representation argument for validity using evidence-centered designwarrants CyGaMEs, itsweb-based learning environment, Selene: A Lunar Construction GaME, its embedded assessment, and a learning dynamics approach to student, measurementandstatistical models.Two studies (US volunteers, Study 1: n = 267, mean (M)age = 15; Study 2: n = 90, Mage = 12) crossvalidate learning dynamics (learner progress, rate of progress and changes in that rate) for Selene's multidimensional goals while players learn and apply standard-based science about fundamental geology and space science concepts. Gameplay data analyzed using regression, calculus and hierarchical linear modeling exhibit overall relatively high standardized rates of progress toward each goal statistically higher than zero. For example, adjusting for nesting within individual players, average rate of progress toward the goal of accreting lunar mass is a z-score of 1.4 (99% confidence interval = 1.40lower, 1.48upper) or 1.4 standard deviations above zero. © 2013 British Educational Research Association.",,"Baker, R.S.J., Data mining for education (2010) International Encyclopedia of Education, 7, pp. 112-118. , In B.

After controlling for the amount, type, and context of violence, higher skilled players experienced lower levels of hostility and aggression related cognitions and greater levels of flow than lower skilled players. Additionally, skill altered players' perceptions as well, as higher skilled players experienced higher construal levels and perceived less violence than lower skilled players. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Aggression; Construal level theory; Flow; Hostility; Video games","Adachi, P.J.C., Willoughby, T., The effect of video game competition and violence on aggressive behavior: Which characteristic has the greatest influence?

Firstly, according to the video characteristics of different users and current network conditions, the algorithm calculated the weights of network factors and selected the optimum network by combining analytic hierarchy process and entropy theory. Secondly, the user's utility function with payoff and cost was designed, and a distributed iterative algorithm is used to obtain the Nash equilibrium. Then the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium are proved. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm enables different users to reasonably distribute in different networks and takes users' fairness and network congestion control into consideration, which increases the utilization of network resources, reduces the users' video distortion, and improves the users' video quality. ©, 2015, Tongxin Xuebao/Journal on Communications.

Free viewpoint video generation is a technology that enables users to watch 3-D objects from their desired viewpoints. Practical implementation of free viewpoint video for sports events is highly demanded. However, a commercially acceptable system has not yet been developed. The main obstacles are insufficient user-end quality of the synthesized images and highly complex procedures that sometimes require manual operations. In this work, we aim to develop a commercially acceptable free viewpoint video system with a billboard representation. A supposed scenario is that soccer games during the day can be broadcasted in 3-D, even in the evening of the same day. Our work is still ongoing. However, we have already developed several techniques to support our goal. First, we captured an actual soccer game at an official stadium where we used 20 full-HD professional cameras. Second, we have implemented several tools for free viewpoint video generation as follow. In order to facilitate free viewpoint video generation, all cameras should be calibrated. We calibrated all cameras using checker board images and feature points on the field (cross points of the soccer field lines). We extract each player region from captured images manually. The background region is estimated by observing chrominance changes of each pixel in temporal domain (automatically). Additionally, we have developed a user interface for visualizing free viewpoint video generation using a graphic library (OpenGL), which is suitable for not only commercialized TV sets but also devices such as smartphones. However, practical system has not yet been completed and our study is still ongoing. © 2015 SPIE-IS&T.","3-D reconstruction; Billboard; Free viewpoint video","Kanade, T., Rander, P.W., Narayanan, P.J., Virtualized reality: Constructing virtual worlds from real scenes (1997) IEEE Multimedia, 4 (1), pp. 34-47; Tanimoto, M., Overview of free viewpoint television (2006) Signal Process.: Image Commun, 21, pp. 454-461; Kitahara, I., Ohta, Y., Scalable 3D representation for 3D video display in a large-scale space (2003) Proc.

However, the presence of losses and congestions throughout the network affects the visual quality of the reconstructed sequence at the end terminal. These inconveniences can be mitigated by specifying different levels of Quality of Service, but an optimal packet classification is hard to obtain since P2P and CDN protocols operate at higher protocol layers (ignoring network conditions of the lowest stages), the network can be quite distributed and little information can be available regarding other network segments involved in the transmission. The peculiarities of the transmission scenario require a distributed and robust packet classification strategy that grants both intra-stream and inter-stream diversities among the loss patterns for the different streams. The classification approach presented here is characterized via a noncooperative game, where the different uploading nodes are players/descriptions competing for the allocation of the available network resources. Each player may switch from a selfish strategy to a more cooperative strategy according to its convenience (opportunistic players). Experimental results show that the proposed solution proves to be quite effective under different network scenarios. © 1991-2012 IEEE.","Content delivery networks (CDNs); Game theory (GT); Multiple description coding (MDC); Opportunistic players; Peer-to-peer (P2P) network","Rückert, J., Abboud, O., Zinner, T., Steinmetz, R., Hausheer, D., Quality adaptation in P2P video streaming based on objective QoE metrics (2012) NETWORKING 2012 (Lecture Notes in Computer Science), 7290, pp. 1-14. , Berlin, Germany: Springer-Verlag; Milani, S., Calvagno, G., Reliable 3D video P2P transmission enabling synthesis of virtual views (2012) Proc. 5th Int.

However, the nature of player-video game interactions has not as yet been clearly defined in the scientific literature. The purpose of the present study was to provide a systematic review of empirical evidences of the current concepts of player-video game interactions in entertainment situations. A total of 72 articles published in scientific journals that deal with human-computer interaction met the criteria for inclusion in the present review. Major findings of these articles were presented in a narrative synthesis. Results showed that player-video game interactions could be defined with multiple concepts that are closely linked and intertwined. These concepts concern player aspects of player-video game interactions, namely engagement and enjoyment, and video game aspects, namely information input/output techniques, game contents and multiplayer games. Global approaches, such as playability, also exist to qualify player-video game interactions. Limitations of these findings are discussed to help researchers to plan future advances of the field and provide supplementary effort to better know the role of less-studied aspects. Practical implications are also discussed to help game designers to optimize the design of player-video game interactions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the studies, the advantages and limitations of role-playing simulation games deserve further exploration. However, existing analyses of the behavioral patterns of role-playing simulation games in science education remain substantially lacking, particularly the integration of diverse behavioral pattern analysis methods. This study thus seeks to analyze the videotaped learning process of 86 college students in game-based learning activities that utilize a role-playing simulation game. This study used the integrated method of sequential analysis and cluster analysis and explored the learners' flow state and learning behavioral patterns. The results show that the use of integrated behavioral pattern analysis helps to explore the traits and limitations of role-playing simulation games in science education as well as learners' reflective behavior patterns. This study identifies a wide variety of learning behavior patterns from three potential clusters of learners and then discusses the learning process of each cluster. The different levels of flow experienced by the learners affected their learning behavior patterns; learners with higher levels of flow demonstrated a more in-depth reflective process. The study further discusses the results of these analyses and makes relevant recommendations for the systems development of the games, its educational applications, and evaluation methods. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been suggested that game quality could be characterised through playing a game with different controllers and comparing their performance. This paper explores that idea through investigating the relative performance of different general game-playing algorithms. Seven game-playing algorithms was used to play several hand-designed, mutated and randomly generated VGDL game descriptions. Results discussed appear to support the conjecture that well-designed games have, in average, a higher performance difference between better and worse game-playing algorithms. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Browne, C., (2008) Automatic Generation and Evaluation of Recombination Games, , Ph.

In our work, we address this issue through the design of wheelchair-accessiblemotion-based game controls.We present KINECTWheels, a toolkit designed to integrate wheelchair movements into motion-based games. Building on the toolkit, we developed CupcakeHeaven, a wheelchair-based video game designed for older adults using wheelchairs, and we created Wheelchair Revolution, a motion-based dance game that is accessible to both persons using wheelchairs and nondisabled players. Evaluation results show that KINECTWheels can be applied tomakemotion-based games wheelchair-accessible, and that wheelchair-based games engage broad audiences in physically stimulating play. Through the application of the wheelchair as an enabling technology in games, our work has the potential of encouraging players of all ages to develop a positive relationship with their wheelchair. © 2015 ACM 1936-7228/2015/03-ART6 $15.00.","Accessibility; Assistive devices; Motion-based games; Older adults; Persons with mobility disabilities; Video games","Aarhus, R., Groenvall, E., Larsen, S.B., Wollsen, S., Turning training into play: Embodied gaming, seniors, physical training and motivation (2011) Gerontechnology, 10 (2), pp. 110-120. , 2011; Bates, P.S., Spencer, J.C., Young, M.E., Rintala, D.H., Assistive technology and the newly disabled adult: Adaptation to wheelchair use (1993) Am.

One of the research hot topics in videogames is related to the identification of gamers behaviour while they are playing the game. This work presents an initial case related to the identification of users behaviour in a particular kind of videogame through gamer interaction extraction and analysis. The Video Game selected in this work is a Tower Defence Game, called OTD, where the user needs to build towers, in a 2-D grid, to avoid the enemies to reach the exit point of the level. It has been created a framework that allows extract the information from the game and later use statistical techniques to analyse the gamers behaviour. Finally, some experiments have been carried out to test this framework. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","K-means; Player behaviour; Tower defence game; Video games","Alayed, H., Frangoudes, F., Neuman, C., Behavioral-based cheating detection in online first person shooters using machine learning techniques (2013) 2013 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Games (CIG), pp. 1-8. , IEEE; Berns, A., Gonzalez-Pardo, A., Camacho, D., Game-like language learning in 3-d virtual environments (2013) Computers and Education, 60 (1), pp. 210-220; Dey, R., Child, C., Ql-bt: Enhancing behaviour tree design and implementation with q-learning (2013) 2013 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Games (CIG), pp. 1-8. , IEEE; Drachen, A., Canossa, A., Yannakakis, G.N., Player modeling using selforganization in tomb raider: Underworld (2009) Proceedings of the 5Th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games, CIG 2009, pp. 1-8. , IEEE Press, Piscataway; Drachen, A., Rafet, S., Bauckhage, C., Thurau, C., Guns, swords and data: Clustering of player behavior in computer games in the wild (2012) Proceedings of CIG 2012, pp. 163-170. , IEEE; Drachen, A., Canossa, A., Towards gameplay analysis via gameplay metrics (2009) Proceedings of the 13Th International Mindtrek Conference: Everyday Life in the Ubiquitous Era, pp. 202-209. , ACM; Gagne, D.J., Congdon, C.B., Fright: A flexible rule-based intelligent ghost team for ms.

In order to test its effectiveness compared to traditional textbook learning we designed a laboratory experiment. Results show no evidence that playing the video-game leads to lower exam performance than reading a textbook, neither for multiple-choice nor for essay questions. We also find no gender bias and no effect of announcing the test prior to the learning task or thereafter. However, game behavior appears to be related to test performance, and differently so for different types of learning. Students perceive the two learning tools similarly in terms of understanding requirements or usefulness, but enjoyed the video-game considerably more. Interestingly, although women enjoyed the game less than men, they do not differ in their test performance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Economics education; Experiment; New teaching methods; Video-game","Anderson, P.H., Lawton, L., Business simulations and cognitive learning: Developments, desires, and future directions (2009) Simulation and Gaming, 40 (2), pp. 193-216; Anderson, P.H., Lawton, L., The relationship between financial performance and other measures of learning on a simulation exercise (1992) Simulation and Gaming, 23, pp. 326-340; Bangert-Drowns, R., Kulik, C., Kulik, J.A., Morgan, M., The instructional effect of feedback in test-like events (1991) Review of Educational Research, 61 (2), pp. 213-238; Barab, S.A., Gresalfi, M., Ingram-Goble, A., Transformational play: Using games to position person, content, and context (2010) Educational Researcher, 39 (7), pp. 525-536; Bell, B., Kozlowski, S., Active learning: Effects of core training design elements on self-regulatory processes, learning, and adaptability (2008) Journal of Applied Psychology, 93, pp. 296-316; Bennett, E., Mims, G., McKenzie, B., Assessing distributed learning: Student perceptions and future directions (2002) in Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education International Conference, 1, pp. 2379-2382; Bettinger, E., Long, B.T., Institutional responses to reduce inequalities in college outcomes: Remedial and developmental courses in higher education (2007) Economic inequality in higher education: access, persistence, and success, , Russell Sage Foundation Press, New York, S.

We have developed a treatment using stereo technology, not to provide a 3D image but to allow dichoptic stimulation. This involves presenting an image with the same background to both eyes but with features of interest removed from the image presented to the normal eye with the aim to preferentially stimulated visual development in the amblyopic, or lazy, eye. Our system, called I-BiT can use either a game or a video (DVD) source as input.

There is little research on such a relationship in adult samples. The aim of the current study was to investigate the association of video game volume with sleep quality in adults via face-to-face interviews using standardized questionnaires. Adults (n = 844, 56.2% women), aged 18-94 years old, participated in the study. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and gaming volume was assessed by asking the hours of gaming on a regular weekday (Mon-Thurs), Friday and weekend day (Sat-Sun). Adjusting for gender, age, educational level, exercise and perceived stress, results of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that video gaming volume was a significant predictor of sleep quality (β = 0.145), fatigue (β = 0.109), insomnia (β = 0.120), bedtime (β = 0.100) and rise time (β = 0.168). Each additional hour of video gaming per day delayed bedtime by 6.9 min (95% confidence interval 2.0-11.9 min) and rise time by 13.8 min (95% confidence interval 7.8-19.7 min). Attributable risk for having poor sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index > 5) due to gaming >1 h day was 30%. When examining the components of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index using multinomial regression analysis (odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals), gaming volume significantly predicted sleep latency, sleep efficiency and use of sleep medication. In general, findings support the conclusion that gaming volume is negatively related to the overall sleep quality of adults, which might be due to underlying mechanisms of screen exposure and arousal. © 2014 European Sleep Research Society.","PSQI; Sleep efficiency; Sleep latency; Video games","Adam, E.K., Snell, E.K., Pendry, P., Sleep timing and quantity in ecological and family context: a nationally representative time-diary study (2007) J.

However, little is known about how to design in-game incentive structures to maximize learning and engagement. In this work, we expand on our previous research that introduced a new ""brain points"" incentive structure designed to promote the growth mindset, or the belief that intelligence is malleable. We replicate our original findings, showing that brain points increase student persistence and use of strategy. We also explore how brain points impact students from different demographic groups. We find that brain points are less engaging for low-income students, and discuss methods of improving our design in the future.

Both facilities, which are the scales used to measure human visual performance, are very important factors for man in leading comfortable and easy life. This study was conducted on 30 participants in their 20s through 30s (19 males and 11 females at 24.53 ± 2.94 years), who can watch 3D video images and play 3D game. Their accommodative and vergence facility were measured before and after they watched 2D and 3D game. It turned out that their accommodative facility improved after they played both 2D and 3D games and more improved right after they played 3D game than 2D game. Likewise, their vergence facility was proved to improve after they played both 2D and 3D games and more improved soon after they played 3D game than 2D game. In addition, it was demonstrated that their accommodative facility improved to greater extent than their vergence facility. While studies have been so far conducted on the adverse effects of 3D contents, from the perspective of human factor, on the imbalance of visual accommodation and convergence, the present study is expected to broaden the applicable scope of 3D contents by utilizing the visual benefit of 3D contents for vision training. © 2015 SPIE-IS&T.","3D game; Accommodative facility; Vergence facility; Vision training; Visual evaluation","Lee, S.H., (2010) Understanding 3D Images, , JINSAEM MEDIA, Seoul; Sung, P.J., (2008) OPTOMETRY, , DAIHAKS PUBLISHING COMPANY, Seoul; Sacks, O., Barry, S.R., Fixing my gaze: A scientist's journey into seeing in three dimensions (2009) Basic Books, pp. 1-256; Kim, J.H., Son, J.S., Park, S.J., Kwon, S.C., Clinical consideration of visual fatigue on 3D images (2013) KICS, 38 C (11), pp. 990-999; Kim, J.D., (2010) Clinical Refraction and Visual Dysfunction Prescription, , Shinkwang, Seoul; Kim, K.H., Lee, C.S., Lee, J.Y., Comparative analysis of the training fidelity of vision training trainee (2009) J.

As part of an ongoing larger scale study, which adopts an ethnographic approach, this research reports on how children think when making their own computer games using their ""Thinking Maps"" and video recordings of group discussions. A model for Thinking for Learning, ""think-to-learn-to-think,"" is discussed and children's activities are used to define the stages of this cycle. The study of children's pre-during-after project ""Thinking Maps"" and explanations during group discussions suggests that their thinking sequences were altered during and after their game design activities. The children presented their ""thinking process"" when designing computer games as a continual circular cycle and described their mind as a virtual lab to plan and visualise solutions before testing them on screen, using the ""Alice"" game design program. © 2015 British Educational Research Association.",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923300965

When people enjoy three dimensional (3D) applications, they may have an unpleasant perceptual experience if the virtual view has low image quality. Thus, high virtual view image quality is mostly expected in the rate control optimization for MDVC with limited channel bandwidth and buffer resources. In this paper, a view synthesis distortion model is proposed first to indicate the importance of each frame in the depth video. Second, to achieve a balance between virtual view image quality and buffer constraint, the proposed view synthesis distortion model is incorporated in the bargain game theoretic model to handle the frame level bit allocation problem for Hierarchical B-picture (HBP) structure. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed rate control algorithm achieves 0.18 dB BDPSNR gain in average compared to the benchmark. The average mismatch of the proposed algorithm is only 0.71%. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Multiview depth video coding; Nash bargaining solution; Rate control; Virtural view quality","Benzie, P., Watson, J., Surman, P., Rakkolainen, I., Hopf, K., Urey, H., Sainov, V., Von Kopylow, C., A survey of 3DTV displays: Techniques and technologies (2007) IEEE Trans.

Inappropriate behaviour decreased with the intervention. The effects were maintained during the follow-up and generalised to a novel game. Social validity data indicated that the study was meaningful and the intervention was feasible and effective.Conclusion Future research should focus on designing play skills interventions that serve to motivate both children with ASD and their typically developing peers in order to promote more spontaneous and interactive play among them. © 2015 Australasian Society for Intellectual Disability, Inc.","autism spectrum disorder;

We designed and developed two 60-min educational games with and without a range of reward features and examined learning outcomes among 242 participants in university laboratories. Although both games improved learning, analyses suggest that the quantity of in-game rewards did not have an impact on biased behavior avoidance or knowledge about biases. To further illuminate these findings, we examined perceptions of feeling rewarded and found that those who felt more rewarded had more favorable views of the gameplay experience, but they did not demonstrate different learning outcomes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

As with the increasing amount of 3D city models and development of 3D computer graphics technology, insufficient research attention has been put into 3D city model based AR navigation, this paper aims to contribute to outdoor AR tracking research by using 3D city models and a 3D game engine. The camera pose and position are calculated through 2D/3D correspondence between the live video frame and 3D city models. The augmented live video feed is rendered in a 3D game engine while the 3D model runs in the background to facilitate the real time registration of virtual objects into the real scene as well as position determination of the moving camera. © 2014 IEEE.","3Dcity model; Augmented Reality(AR); Location Based Services (LBS); Video","Zhou, F., Duh, H.B., Billinghurst, M., Trends in augmented reality tracking (2008) Interaction and Display: A Review of Ten Years of ISMAR, IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality; Loxam, J., Drummond, T., Student-t mixture filter for robust (2008) Real-Time Visual Tracking, Proceedings of European Computer Vision Conference; Reitmayr, G., Drummond, T.W., Going out: Robust tracking for outdoor augmented reality (2006) Proc.

However, this body of work has mostly ignored one prominent feature of many violent games: moral decision making. It is possible that the influence of video game violence could change when moral decisions are brought into the context. One way video games change behavior is through changes in players' self-perceptions, a process called identity simulation. In addition, a perspective called moral license predicts that these effects should not necessarily be consistent across behaviors, in that people should try to balance selfishness with keeping the moral high ground across many behaviors. Therefore, moral choices (or immoral choices) in a video game may predict less moral (or more moral) behaviors right after the game. However, later behavior may revert yet again, creating a cycle of pro- and antisocial behaviors. The present experiment asks participants to make moral choices in a video game, and then measures their behavior on two subsequent tasks. Results indicate that taking what participants perceive to be the more moral mind-set in the video game predicts more antisocial behavior on the first task, but more pro-social behavior on the next task. These results support identity simulation and moral license processes in a video game and moral behavior context, and indicate that there may be greater complexity in video game violence effects than previously understood. © 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"Anderson, C.A., Shibuya, A., Ihori, N., Violent video game effects on aggressio n, empathy, and prosocial behavior in eastern and western countries: A meta-analytic review (2010) Psychological Bulletin, 136, pp. 151-173; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Effects of violent video games on aggre ssive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, and prosocial behavior: A meta-analytic review of the scientific literature (2001) Psychological Science, 12, pp. 353-359; Ewoldsen, D.R., Eno, C.A., Okdie, B.M., Effect of playing violent video games cooperatively or competitively on subsequent cooperative behavior (2012) Cyberpsychology, Behavior, & Social Networking, 15, pp. 1-4; Velez, J.A., Mahood, C., Ewoldsen, D.R., Ingroup versus outgroup conflict in the context of violent video game play: The effect of cooperation on increased helping and decreased aggression (2014) Communication Research, 41, pp. 607-626; Anderson, C.A., Bushman, B.J., Human aggression (2002) Annual Review of Psychology, 53, pp. 27-51; Buckley, K.E., Anderson, C.A., A theoretical model of t he effects and consequences of playing video games (2006) Playing Video Games: Motives, Responses, and Consequences, pp. 363-378. , Vorderer P, Bryant J, eds Mahwah, NJ Lawrence Erlbaum; De Groot, J., Steg, L., Morality and prosocial behavior: The role of awareness, responsibility, and norms in the norm activation model (2009) The Journal of Social Psychology, 149, pp. 425-449; Greitemeyer, T., Intense acts of violence during video game play make daily life aggression appear innocuous: A new mechanism why violent video games increase aggression (2014) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 50, pp. 52-56; Fischer, P., Kastenmuller, A., Grietemeyer, T., Media violence and the self: The impact of personalized gaming characters in aggressive video games on aggressive behavior (2010) Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 46, pp. 192-195; Hull, J.G., Brunelle, T.J., Prescott, A.T., A longitudinal study of risk-glorifying video games and behavioral deviance (2014) Journal of Personality & Social Psychology, 107, pp. 300-325; Hull, J.G., Draghici, A.M., Sargent, J.D., A longitudinal study of risk-glorifying video games and reckless driving (2012) Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 1, pp. 244-253; Kaufman, G.F., Libby, L.K., Cha nging beliefs and behavior through experience-taking (2012) Journal of Personality & Social Psychology, 103, pp. 1-19; Schulzke, M., Moral decision making in Fallout.

Athletic administrations attempt to gain an edge by bringing recruits to a home game, highlighting the atmosphere unique to campus. This is however not always possible since most recruiting efforts happen off-season. So, they relate the football game experience through video recordings and visits to football facilities. While these substitutes provide a general idea of a game, they cannot capture the feeling of playing while cheered on by a crowd of 55,000 people. To address this challenge and improve the recruitment process, the Iowa State University (ISU) athletic department and the Virtual Reality Applications Center (VRAC) teamed up to build an alternative to the game-day experience using the world's highest resolution six-sided virtual reality (VR) environment - the C6, and a portable low-cost head-mounted display (HMD) system. This paper presents techniques used in the development of the immersive and portable VR environments followed by validation of the work through quantifying immersion and presence through a formal user study. Results from the user study indicate that both the HMD and C6 are an improvement over the standard practice of showing videos to convey the atmosphere of an ISU Cyclone football game. In addition, both the C6 and HMD were scored similar in immersion and presence categories. This indicates that the low-cost portable HMD version of the application produces minimal trade off in experience for a fraction of the cost. © 2015 SPIE-IS&T.","College football; Football user study; Head-mounted display; HMD vs immersive VR; Immersive football experience; Immersive game day experience; Oculus football; Virtual reality football","Clayton, M.J., Cavanagh, K.V., Hettche, M., Institutional branding: A content analysis of public service announcements from American Universities (2012) Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, 22 (2), pp. 182-205; Brock, D.E., Poole, M.S., Joseph, M., Does branding impact student recruitment: A critical evaluation (2014) Journal of Marketing for Higher Education, 24 (1), pp. 11-21; Jessop, A., The surprising factors driving college football recruits' college decision (2012) Forbes, , http://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciajessop/2012/12/14/the-surprising-factors-driving-college-football-recruitsdecision, 14 December, 1 January 2015; Boise State University, (2015) Identity, , https://brandstandards.boisestate.edu/identity, 1 January; Kramer, A., How nike and oregon created college football's perfect brand (2014) Bleacher Report, , http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2118855-how-nike-and-oregon-created-college-footballs-perfect-brand, 11 July, 1 January; Bideau, B., Kulpa, R., Vignais, N., Brault, S., Multon, F., Using virtual reality to analyze sports performance (2010) Computer Graphics and Applications, pp. 14-21; Havig, P., McIntire, J., Geiselman, E., Virtual reality in a cave: Limitations and the need for HMDs?

Since video game AI is often specifically designed for each game, video game AI tools currently focus on allowing video game developers to quickly and efficiently create specific AI. One issue with this approach is that it does not efficiently exploit the numerous similarities that exist between video games not only of the same genre, but of different genres too, resulting in a difficulty to handle the many aspects of a complex environment independently for each video game. Inspired by the human ability to detect analogies between games and apply similar behavior on a conceptual level, this paper suggests an approach based on the use of a unified conceptual framework to enable the development of conceptual AI which relies on conceptual views and actions to define basic yet reasonable and robust behavior. The approach is illustrated using two video games, Raven and StarCraft: Brood War. © 2015 Firas Safadi et al.",,"Portability and Supported Hardware Platforms, , http://netbsd.org/about/portability.html, The NetBSD Foundation; Microsoft, Windows NT Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), , http://support.microsoft.com/kb/99588; Nareyek, A., Combs, N., Karlsson, B., Mesdaghi, S., Wilson, I., The 2003 report of the IGDAs artificial intelligence interface standards committee (2003) Tech.

Participants were 477 male, first year students at a liberal arts college. In the week before the start of classes, participants were given two surveys: one of expected college engagement, and the second of video game usage, including a measure of video game addiction. Results suggested that video game addiction is (a) negatively correlated with expected college engagement, (b) negatively correlated with college GPA, even when controlling for high school GPA, and (c) negatively correlated with drug and alcohol violations that occurred during the first year in college. Results are discussed in terms of implications for male students' engagement and success in college, and in terms of the construct validity of video game addiction. © 2015 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"Gentile, D., Pathological video-game use among youth ages 8 to 18: A national study (2009) Psychological Science, 20, pp. 594-602; Lenhart, A., Kahne, J., Middaugh, E., (2008) Teens, Video Games, and Civics: Teens' Gaming Experiences Are Diverse and Include Significant Social Interaction and Civic Engagement.

Cultivation theory suggests that long-term exposure to media content can affect perceptions of social realities in a way that they become more similar to the representations in the media and, in turn, impact one's beliefs and attitudes. Previous studies on video games and cultivation have often been cross-sectional or experimental, and the limited longitudinal work in this area has only considered time intervals of up to 1 month. Additionally, previous work in this area has focused on the effects of violent content and relied on self-selected or convenience samples composed mostly of adolescents or college students. Enlisting a 3 year longitudinal design, the present study assessed the relationship between video game use and sexist attitudes, using data from a representative sample of German players aged 14 and older (N=824). Controlling for age and education, it was found that sexist attitudes - measured with a brief scale assessing beliefs about gender roles in society - were not related to the amount of daily video game use or preference for specific genres for both female and male players.

Method: Online survey methodology was used to gather information from parents of children with ASD between the ages of 8 and 12 years. The finalized data set included 152 cases. Descriptive statistics and frequency analyses were used to examine participant demographics and video game play. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to evaluate questions on the theory of planned behavior. Regression analyses determined the predictive ability of the theory of planned behavior constructs, and t tests provided additional descriptive information about between-group differences. Results: Children with ASD play video games. There are no significant differences in the time, intensity, or types of games played based on severity of ASD symptoms (mild vs. moderate). Parents of children with ASD had positive attitudes about video game play. Conclusions: Parents of children with ASD appear to support video game play. On average, parents indicated video game play was positive for their children with ASD, particularly if they believed the games were having a positive impact on their child’s development. © 2015 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.",,"Ajzen, I., (1985) From Intentions to Actions: A Theory of Planned Behavior, pp. 11-39. , In J.

Participants were 701 male adolescents attending high school (Mage=15.6 years). Analyses showed that pathological gaming was predicted not only by higher time spent on gaming, but also by participation in a greater number of video game genres. Specifically, the wider the array of video game genres played, the higher were the negative consequences caused by gaming. Findings show that versatility can be considered as one of the behavioral risk factors related to gaming addiction, which may be characterized by a composite and diversified experience with video games.

Three components are analysed: (1) The significance of cross-fertilization with other creative fields in the emergence and growth of the cluster; (2) The benefits of clustering; (3) The role of policies in the maturation of those clusters. The case studies included are the most notable video game clusters in Canada and Australia: Montreal and Melbourne. The research methods applied are semi-directed interviews with policy advisors and game developers in each context. As an outcome of this research, its findings reveal that the video game industry in Melbourne cannot yet be qualified as a creative cluster but is rather still very much embedded in a technology culture. In Montreal, the cluster is more mature and presents the attributes of a creative cluster, as there are interrelations between the various actors of the cluster, and with other creative activities. In both contexts the impact of policies on the maturation of the cluster is limited; rather, attaining a critical mass of video game companies is necessary for cross-fertilization to occur. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",,"(2012), http://www.acmi.net.au/global/docs/games_timeline_australia.pdf, Timeline of game development in Australia.

I test this hypothesis using the data from the Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. The endogeneity of video game playing is addressed by using panel data methods and controlling for an extensive list of child and family characteristics. To address the measurement error in video game playing, I instrument children's weekday time use with their weekend time use. After taking into account the endogeneity and measurement error, video game playing is found to positively affect children's problem solving ability. The effect of video game playing on problem solving ability is comparable to the effect of educational activities.

A survey of the Norwegian population aged 16-74 years (N=10,081, response rate 43.6%) was carried out in 2013, which included the Gaming Addiction Scale for Adolescents (GAS). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that a two-factor structure, which separated peripheral criteria from core criteria, fitted the data better (CFI=0.963; RMSEA=0.058) compared to the original one-factor solution where all items are determined to load only on one factor (CFI=0.905, RMSEA=0.089). This was also found when we analyzed men aged ≤33 years, men aged >33 years, women aged ≤33 years, and women aged >33 years separately. This indicates that the GAS measures both engagement and problems related to video games. Multi-group measurement invariance testing showed that the factor structure was valid in all four groups (configural invariance) for the two-factor structure but not for the one-factor structure. A novel approach to categorization of problem gamers and addicted gamers where only the core criteria items are used (the CORE 4 approach) was compared to the approach where all items are included (the GAS 7 approach). The current results suggest that the CORE 4 approach might be more appropriate for classification of problem gamers and addicted gamers compared to the GAS 7 approach. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"Lemmens, J.S., Valkenburg, P.M., Peter, J., The effects of pathological gaming on aggressive behavior (2011) Journal of Youth & Adolescence, 40, pp. 38-47; Lemmens, J.S., Valkenburg, P.M., Peter, J., Development and validation of a game addiction scale for adolescents (2009) Media Psychology, 12, pp. 77-95; Mentzoni, R.A., Brunborg, G.S., Molde, H., Problematic video game use: Estimated prevalence and associations with mental and physical health.

Using the example of Fate of the World, a climate change simulation game, David Waddington addresses these concerns through a careful demonstration of how video games can recapture some of the lost potential of Dewey's original program of education through occupations. Not only do simulation games realize most of the original goals of education through occupations, but they also solve some of the serious practical problems that Dewey's curriculum generated. Waddington concludes the essay with an analysis of Waks's critiques and some cautionary notes about why it is important to be temperate in our endorsement of educational video gaming. © 2015 Board of Trustees | University of Illinois.",,"Skinner, B.F., The Shame of American Education (1984) American Psychologist, 39 (9), p. 952; Davidson, J., Eckert, R.K., (1983) Math Blaster, 5.25"" diskette, , (Torrance, CA: Davidson and Associates); Shaffer, D.W., (2006) How Computer Games Help Children Learn, p. 123. , (New York: PalgraveMacmillan); Gee, J.P., (2003) What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy, , (New York: Palgrave Macmillan); Cunningham, C., Transforming Schooling Through Technology: Twenty-First-Century Approaches to Participatory Learning (2009) Education and Culture, 25 (2), pp. 46-61; Robert, C., Dewey Wins!

Study 1 demonstrates that interacting with physically aggressive virtual agents decreases players' trust in subsequent interactions. This effect was stronger for players who were dispositionally sensitive to victimization. In Study 2, long-term effects of adolescents' frequent exposure to video game violence on interpersonal trust and victim sensitivity were investigated. Cross-lagged path analyses show that the reported frequency of playing violent video games reduced interpersonal trust over a period of 12 months, particularly among victim-sensitive players. These findings are in line with the sensitivity to mean intentions (SeMI) model, and they suggest that interpersonal mistrust is a relevant long-term outcome of frequent exposure to video game violence. © ,Taylor & Francis.",,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions., , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; Anderson, C.A., Anderson, K.B., Deuser, W.E., Examining an affective aggression framework: Weapon and temperature effects on aggressive thoughts, affect, and attitudes (1996) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 22, pp. 366-377; Anderson, C.A., Dill, K.E., Video games and aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behavior in the laboratory and in life (2000) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 78, pp. 772-790; Anderson, C.A., Murphy, C.R., Violent video games and aggressive behavior in young women (2003) Aggressive Behavior, 29, pp. 423-429; Anderson, C.A., Shibuya, A., Ihori, N., Swing, E.L., Bushman, B.J., Sakamoto, A., Saleem, M., Violent video game effects on aggression, empathy, and prosocial behavior in eastern and western countries: A meta-analytic review (2010) Psychological Bulletin, 136, pp. 151-173; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory: An agentic perspective (2001) Annual Review of Psychology, 52, pp. 1-26; Bartholow, B.D., Sestir, M.A., Davis, E.B., Correlates and consequences of exposure to video game violence: Hostile personality, empathy, and aggressive behavior (2005) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31, pp. 1573-1586; Berg, J., Dickhaut, J., McCabe, K., Trust, reciprocity, and social history (1995) Games and Economic Behavior, 10, pp. 122-142; Berkowitz, L., On the formation and regulation of anger and aggression: A cognitive-neoassociationistic analysis (1990) American Psychologist, 45, pp. 494-503; Bondü, R., Elsner, B., (2012) Ungerechtigkeitssensibilität als Risikofaktor für Verhaltensauffälligkeiten im Kindes- und Jugendalter?; Buckley, K.E., Anderson, C.A., A theoretical model of the effects and consequences of playing video games (2006) Playing video games: Motives, responses, and consequences, pp. 363-378. , Vorderer P., Bryant J., (eds), Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum; Bushman, B.J., Anderson, C.A., Violent video games and hostile expectations: A test of the general aggression model (2002) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 28, pp. 1679-1686; Bushman, B.J., Rothstein, H.R., Anderson, C.A., Much ado about something: Violent video game effects and a school of red herring: Reply to Ferguson and Kilburn (2010) (2010) Psychological Bulletin, 136, pp. 182-187; Cantor, J., Wilson, B.J., Modifying fear responses to mass media in preschool and elementary school children (1984) Journal of Broadcasting, 28, pp. 431-443; Carver, C.S., Emergent integration in contemporary personality psychology (1996) Journal of Research in Personality, 30, pp. 319-334; Cohen, J., Cohen, P., West, S.G., Aiken, L.S., (2003) Applied multiple regression/correlation analysis for the behavioral sciences, , 3rd ed., Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum; Crick, N.R., Dodge, K.A., A review and reformulation of social information-processing mechanisms in children's social adjustment (1994) Psychological Bulletin, 115, pp. 74-101; Dalbert, C., Sallay, H., Developmental trajectories and developmental functions of the belief in a just world: Some concluding remarks (2004) The justice motive in adolescence and young adulthood: Origins and consequences, pp. 248-262. , Dalbert C., Sallay H., (eds), London, UK: Routledge; Deutsch, M., Trust and suspicion (1958) Journal of Conflict Resolution, 2, pp. 265-279; Eastin, M., The influence of competitive and cooperative group game play on state hostility (2007) Human Communication Research, 33, pp. 450-466; Eastin, M.S., Griffiths, R.P., Beyond the shooter game: Examining presence and hostile outcomes among male game players (2006) Communication Research, 33, pp. 448-466; Eastin, M., Griffiths, R., Unreal: Hostile expectations from social gameplay (2009) New Media & Society, 11, pp. 509-531; Eisenberg, N., Sheffield Morris, A., Moral cognition and pro social responding in adolescence (2004) Handbook of adolescent psychology, pp. 155-188. , Lerner R.

The practice, intended to minimise in-game violence and reduce the depiction of gore, has become common since the release of Carmageddon (1997) and can be deployed as a means of either placating ratings boards and censors or offering players greater in-game choice, as in the case of Serious Sam 3 (2011). This article suggests that alternative blood and the more general depiction of on-screen targets as ‘monstrous’ as currently deployed in video games often serves to dehumanise the familiar and limit the presentation of death. Instances from video games in the horror, Western and war genres are examined and placed in a context that considers the history of these genres and of thematically related propaganda. This analysis suggests that the justification of deaths through alternative blood and monstrousness may not dampen the impact of violence in the way that developers and moral guardians might assume. Ultimately, this article argues that the desire to minimise the impact of in-game deaths by rendering victims as ‘monsters’ enacts a type of cultural violence by dehumanising them. This aesthetic dehumanisation of in-game victims echoes propaganda strategies used to justify historical violence and may have negative social consequences and should be further studied. © 2015, © 2015 International Visual Sociology Association.",,"(2005) Resolution on Violence in Video Games and Interactive Media, , https://www.apa.org/about/policy/interactive-media.pdf, American Psychological Association, July; Annaler, G., Parades, Public Spaces, and Propaganda: The Nazi Culture Parades in Munich (2008) Human Geography, 90 (4), pp. 349-367; Auerbach, N., (2012) Our Vampires, Ourselves, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; Bishop, K.W., The Idle Proletariat: Dawn of the Dead, Consumer Ideology, and the Loss of Productive Labor (2010) The Journal of Popular Culture, 43 (2), pp. 234-248; Bytwerk, R.L., The Argument for Genocide in Nazi Propaganda (2005) Quarterly Journal of Speech, 91 (1), pp. 37-62; (1996) Resident Evil, , Osaka: Capcom; Clover, C.J., (1993) Men, Women, and Chain Saws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Cohen, J.J., (1996) Monster Theory: Reading Culture, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; (2011) Serious Sam 3: BFE, , Austin, TX: Devolver Digital; Diego, R.S., North, R., (2010) Red Dead Redemption Undead Nightmare, , New York: Rockstar Games; Dower, J.W., (1986) War Without Mercy: Race and Power in the Pacific War, , New York: Pantheon; Ewan, E., (1976) Death Race, , Sunnyvale, CA: Exidy; New!

With a story that exists simultaneously in the modern day and the 15th century, the games allow the player to take control of characters and alter, or make possible, events recognisable as historical fact. It plays with both history and memory and history as memory, as the life of the primary player character is being relived through the genetic memories of one of his descendants. Being highly narrative-bound, the Assassin's Creed games use, via the medium of the screen, the rift between history and memory as a central element of narrative, theme, and game design, which this paper will explore. Furthermore, using theories of convergence this paper will examine how video games provide a new, interactive mode of storytelling that is rapidly becoming representative of our age. © Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities.",,"(2009) Assassin's Creed II, , Ubisoft Montreal; (2013) Assassin's Creed IV, , Ubisoft Montreal; Harvey, D., (1989) The Condition of Postmodernity: An Enquiry i Nto the Origins of Cultural Change, , Oxford: Basil Blackwell; Jenkins, H., (2006) Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide, , New York: New York University Press; Klastrup, L., (2003) Towards a Poetics of Virtual Worlds - Multiuser Textuality and the Emergence of Story, , PhD Thesis, IT University of Copenhagen; Nora, P., Between memory and history: Les lieux de memoire (1989) Representations, 26, p. 7. , (Spring 1989; special issue, Memory and Counter Memory); Washburn, D., Mastering Narrative in Final Fantasy X, , muse.jhu.edu, Retrieved from Accessed 20/01/15",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929165980

Here we ask whether video game play also alters temporal processing in the amblyopic brain. When visual targets are presented in rapid succession, correct identification of the first target (T1) can interfere with identification of the second (T2). This is known as the attentional blink. We measured the attentional blink in each eye of adults with amblyopia before and after 40 hours of active video game play, using a rapid serial visual presentation technique. After videogame play, we observed a ∼40% reduction in the attentional blink (identifying T2 200 ms after T1) seen through the amblyopic eye and this improvement in performance transferred substantially to the untrained fellow sound eye. Our experiments show that the enhanced performance cannot be simply explained by eye patching alone, or to improved visual acuity, but is specific to videogame experience. Thus, videogame training might have important therapeutic applications for amblyopia and other visual brain disorders.",,"Shapiro, K.L., Raymond, J.E., Arnell, K.M., The attentional blink (1997) Trends Cogn.

In spite of the discernible trauma trend within video games, however, and the potential they exhibit for representing trauma in new ways, they have received very little critical notice from trauma theorists. In this article, we argue that a trauma-theoretical study of games has much to offer our understanding of the ways that trauma can be represented, in addition to giving game studies scholars further insight into how games manage to elicit such strong emotions and difficult ethical quandaries in players.

Previous research has uncovered inverse relationships between frequency of play and a range of psychosocial outcomes, however, a reliance on cross-sectional research designs and opportunity sampling of only the most involved players has limited the broader understanding of these relationships. Enlisting a large representative sample and a longitudinal design, the current study examined these relationships and the mechanisms that underlie them to determine if poorer psychosocial outcomes are a cause (i.e.; pre-existing psychosocial difficulties motivate play) or a consequence (i.e.; poorer outcomes are driven by use) of online video game engagement. The results dispute previous claims that online game play has negative effects on the psychosocial well-being of its users and instead indicate that individuals play online games to compensate for pre-existing social difficulties. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, little is known about what factors contribute toward more hours of gaming per week, as well as what factors may limit or protect adolescents from excessive gaming. The aim of the present study was to examine associations between adolescents' accessibility to video gaming devices, the locations played (i.e., bedroom, shared rooms), parental regulation of technology use, and the amount of hours spent video gaming during the week (weekdays vs. weekends). Adolescents (N=422; age 16.3±2.0 years, 41% male) completed an online questionnaire battery, including demographics, video gaming behaviors (e.g., hours played weekdays/weekends, time of day played, devices owned, locations played, etc.), and a questionnaire measuring aspects of parents' regulation of game playing (e.g., rules, limit setting, co-gaming). Accessibility to the adolescents' own devices, but not shared devices or device portability, was predictive of hours gaming on weekdays and weekends. Location (i.e., bedroom) was associated with increased gaming across the week. Parents discussing cybersafety was predictive of lower hours of gaming (weekdays and weekends). However, limit setting, monitoring, and co-gaming showed no significant effects. Adolescents' access to their own gaming equipped devices, as well as gaming in their bedrooms, were linked to increased hours of gaming. The findings suggest that in order to curb the increase in hours gaming, parents are advised to delay the ownership of adolescents' devices, encourage use in shared rooms, and discuss aspects of cybersafety with their teenage children. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"Australian Bureau of Statistics, (2011) Australian Social Trends: Online @ Home (Cat.

The aim of this study was to explore the experience women with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) had, using commercially available MCVGs; and to investigate indicators of symptom severity and performance of activities of daily living (ADL). Method: Of 15 female participants diagnosed with FMS, 7 completed a program of five sessions with Nintendo Wii (Wii), five sessions with PlayStation 3 Move (PS3 Move) and five sessions with Microsoft Xbox Kinect (Xbox Kinect). Interviews were conducted at baseline and post-intervention and were supported by data from observation and self-reported assessment. Results: Participants experienced play with MCVGs as a way to get distraction from pain symptoms while doing fun and manageable exercise. They enjoyed the slow pace and familiarity of Wii, while some considered PS3 Move to be too fast paced. Xbox Kinect was reported as the best console for exercise. There were no indication of general improvement in symptom severity or performance of ADL. Conclusion: This study demonstrated MCVG as an effective healthcare intervention for the women with FMS who completed the program, with regards to temporary pain relief and enjoyable low impact exercise.Implications for RehabilitationExercise is recommended in the management of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).People with FMS often find it counterintuitive to exercise because of pain exacerbation, which may influence adherence to an exercise program.Motion-controlled video games may offer temporary pain relief and fun low impact exercise for women with FMS. © 2015 Informa UK Ltd.","Assistive technology; Chronic pain; Distraction; Nintendo Wii; PlayStation 3 Move; Qualitative content analysis; Virtual reality; Xbox Kinect","Wolfe, F., Clauw, D.J., Fitzcharles, M.A., The American College of Rheumatology preliminary diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia and measurement of symptom severity (2010) Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken), 62, pp. 600-610; Staud, R., Biology and therapy of fibromyalgia: Pain in fibromyalgia syndrome (2006) Arthritis Res Ther, 8, p. 208; Branco, J.C., Bannwarth, B., Failde, I., Prevalence of fibromyalgia: A survey in five European countries (2010) Semin Arthritis Rheum, 39, pp. 448-453; Annemans, L., Le Lay, K., Taieb, C., Societal and patient burden of fibromyalgia syndrome (2009) Pharmacoeconomics, 27, pp. 547-559; Hauser, W., Klose, P., Langhorst, J., Efficacy of different types of aerobic exercise in fibromyalgia syndrome: A systematic review and meta-Analysis of randomised controlled trials (2010) Arthritis Res Ther, 12, p.

Participants played a driving video game either solely in the single group or with a friend in the paired group. The two groups (single and paired) were subdivided according to their game proficiency (low and high). The NIRS data demonstrated a significant interaction of group by proficiency. Low-proficiency players in the paired group showed lower activation than those in the single group, but high-proficiency players did not. In the paired group, high-proficiency players showed higher activation than low-proficiency players, but not in the single group. These results suggest that NIRS detects social presence effects in everyday situations: decreasing prefrontal activation in low-proficiency performers due to tension reduction and increasing prefrontal activation in high-proficiency performers due to increased arousal. © Japanese Psychological Association 2015.","Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS); Online monitoring; Prefrontal cortex (PFC); Presence of others; Task proficiency",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922422668

A total of 512 published studies on AVGs were located, and 35 articles were included based on the following criteria: (i) data-based research articles published in English between 1985 and 2015; (ii) studied some types of AVGs and related outcomes among children/adolescents and (iii) had at least one comparison within each study. Data were extracted to conduct comparisons for outcome measures in three separate categories: AVGs and sedentary behaviours, AVGs and laboratory-based exercise, and AVGs and field-based physical activity. Effect size for each entry was calculated with the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software in 2015. Mean effect size (Hedge's g) and standard deviation were calculated for each comparison. Compared with sedentary behaviours, AVGs had a large effect on health outcomes. The effect sizes for physiological outcomes were marginal when comparing AVGs with laboratory-based exercises. The comparison between AVGs and field-based physical activity had null to moderate effect sizes. AVGs could yield equivalent health benefits to children/adolescents as laboratory-based exercise or field-based physical activity. Therefore, AVGs can be a good alternative for sedentary behaviour and addition to traditional physical activity and sports in children/adolescents. © 2015 World Obesity.","Body composition; Cardiovascular fitness; Energy expenditure; Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928975612

This study compared the PAEE and intensity of AVGs to traditional seated video games (SVGs). Methods: Fifty-three young adults (18-35 y; 27 females) volunteered to play 6 video games (4 AVGs, 2 SVGs). Anthropometrics and resting metabolism were measured before testing. While playing the games (6-10 min) in random order against a playmate, the participants wore a portable metabolic analyzer for measuring PAEE (kcal/min) and intensity (METs). A repeated-measures ANOVA compared the PAEE and intensity across games with sex, BMI, and PA status as main effects. Results: The intensity of AVGs (6.1 ± 0.2 METs) was significantly greater than SVGs (1.8 ± 0.1 METs). AVGs elicited greater PAEE than SVGs in all participants (5.3 ± 0.2 vs 0.8 ± 0.0 kcal/min); PAEE during the AVGs was greater in males and overweight participants compared with females and healthy weight participants (p's < .05). Conclusions: The newest AVGs do qualify as MVPA and can contribute to the recommended dose of MVPA for weight management in young adults. © 2015 Human Kinetics, Inc.","Accelerometry; Exergaming; Obesity; Physical activity","Butler, S.M., Black, D.R., Blue, C.L., Gretebeck, R.J., Change in diet, physical activity, and body weight in female college freshman (2004) Am J Health Behav., 28 (1), pp. 24-32. , PubMed; Gropper, S.S., Simmons, K.P., Connell, L.J., Ulrich, P.V., Changes in body weight, composition, and shape: A 4-year study of college students (2012) Appl Phys, Nutr, Metab = Phys Appl, Nutr et Metab., 37 (6), pp. 1118-1123; Lowry, R., Galuska, D.A., Fulton, J.E., Wechsler, H., Kann, L., Collins, J.L., Physical activity, food choice, and weight management goals and practices among US college students (2000) Am J Prev Med., 18 (1), pp. 18-27. , PubMed; Napolitano, M.A., Hayes, S., Bennett, G.G., Ives, A.K., Foster, G.D., Using Facebook and text messaging to deliver a weight loss program to college students (2013) Obesity (Silver Spring)., 21 (1), pp. 25-31. , PubMed; Levitsky, D.A., Halbmaier, C.A., Mrdjenovic, G., The freshman weight gain: A model for the study of the epidemic of obesity (2004) Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord., 28 (11), pp. 1435-1442. , PubMed; Kwan, M.Y., Cairney, J., Faulkner, G.E., Pullenayegum, E.E., Physical activity and other health-risk behaviors during the transition into early adulthood: A longitudinal cohort study (2012) Am J Prev Med., 42 (1), pp. 14-20. , PubMed; Jung, M.E., Bray, S.R., Martin Ginis, K.A., Behavior change and the freshman 15: Tracking physical activity and dietary patterns in 1st-year university women (2008) J Am Coll Health., 56 (5), pp. 523-530. , PubMed; Pullman, A.W., Masters, R.C., Zalot, L.C., Effect of the transition from high school to university on anthropometric and lifestyle variablesin males (2009) Appl Physiol Nutr Metab., 34 (2), pp. 162-171. , PubMed; Wack, E.R., Tantleff-Dunn, S., Cyber sexy: Electronic game play and perceptions of attractiveness among college-Aged men (2008) Body Image., 5 (4), pp. 365-374. , PubMed; Ogletree, S.M., Drake, R., College students' video game participation and perceptions: Gender differences and implications (2007) Sex Roles., 56, pp. 537-542; Lucas, K., Sherry, J.L., Sex differences in video game play: A communication-based explanation (2004) Communic Res., 31, pp. 499-523; Physical activity guidelines advisory committee report, 2008. to the secretary of health and human services part a: Executive summary (2009) Nutr Rev., 67 (2), pp. 114-120. , U.

It was long thought to develop into a permanent deficit, unless properly treated before the end of the sensitive period for visual recovery. However, a number of studies now suggest that adults with long-standing amblyopia may at least partially recover visual acuity and stereopsis following perceptual training. Eliminating or reducing interocular suppression has been hypothesized to be at the root of these changes. Here we show that playing a novel dichoptic video game indeed results in reduced suppression, improved visual acuity and, in some cases, improved stereopsis. Our relatively large cohort of adults with amblyopia, allowed us, for the first time, to assess the link between visual function recovery and reduction in suppression. Surprisingly, no significant correlation was found between decreased suppression and improved visual function. This finding challenges the prevailing view and suggests that while dichoptic training improves visual acuity and stereopsis in adult amblyopia, reduced suppression is unlikely to be at the root of visual recovery. These results are discussed in the context of their implication on recovery of amblyopia in adults.",,"Levi, D.M., Li, R.W., Perceptual learning as a potential treatment for amblyopia: A mini-review (2009) Vis.

This article analyzes three key aspects of liminoid games: (1) techniques of reappropriation during production, (2) rules and expectations of engagement with the past and the ""real"" that games offer, and (3) emergent ways in which player communities, discourses, and productions recalibrate those politics of engagement. © SAGE Publications 2014.","Emergent; Games; History; Interface; Liminoid; Memory; Myth; Paratext; Real; Ritual; Simulacrum","Abbott, M., Backlash (2010) Brainy Gamer; Appadurai, A., (1996) Modernity at Large, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press;; Avellone, C., Video game writing vs writing (2010) Obsidian Forum Community; Baudrillard, J., (1981) Simulacra and Simulation, pp. 43-48. , Glaser S.

We perform a series of linguistic analyses to gain a deeper understanding of the role communication plays in the expression of toxic behavior. We characterize linguistic behavior of toxic players and compare it with that of typical players in an online competition game. We also find empirical support describing how a player transitions from typical to toxic behavior. Our findings can be helpful to automatically detect and warn players who may become toxic and thus insulate potential victims from toxic playing in advance. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Cyberbullying; League of Legends; Online games; Toxic behavior; Tribunal; Verbal violence","Barlinska, J., Szuster, A., Winiewski, M., Cyberbullying among adolescent bystanders: Role of the communication medium, form of violence, and empathy (2013) Journal of Community and Applied Social Psychology, 23 (1), pp. 37-51; Blackburn, J., Kwak, H., STFU NOOB!: Predicting crowdsourced decisions on toxic behavior in online games (2014) Proceedings of the 23Rd International Conference on World Wide Web, WWW 2014, pp. 877-888; Chen, V.H., Duh, H.B., Ng, C.W., Players who play to make others cry: The influence of anonymity and immersion (2009) Proceedings of the International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology, ACE 2009, pp. 341-344; Chesney, T., Coyne, I., Logan, B., Madden, N., Griefing in virtual worlds: Causes, casualties and coping strategies (2009) Information Systems Journal, 19 (6), pp. 525-548; Conmy, O.B., Trash Talk in a Competitive Setting: Impact on Self-efficacy, Affect, and Performance (2008) Proquest; Lin, H., Sun, C.-T., The “white-eyed” player culture: Grief play and construction of deviance in MMORPGs (2005) Proceedings of Digra 2005 Conference; Suler, J., The online disinhibition effect (2004) Cyberpsychology and Behavior, 7 (3), pp. 321-326; Thompson, P., Whats fueling the flames in cyberspace?

However, these games were designed for recreational use, which creates challenges for clinical implementation. Busy clinicians require decision-making support to inform game selection and implementation that address individual therapeutic goals. This article describes the development and preliminary evaluation of a knowledge translation (KT) resource to support clinical decision making about selection and use of Kinect games in physical therapy. The knowledge-to-action framework guided the development of the Kinecting With Clinicians (KWiC) resource. Five physical therapists with VR and video game expertise analyzed the Kinect Adventure games. A consensus-building method was used to arrive at categories to organize clinically relevant attributes guiding game selection and game play. The process and results of an exploratory usability evaluation of the KWiC resource by clinicians through interviews and focus groups at 4 clinical sites is described. Subsequent steps in the evaluation and KT process are proposed, including making the KWiC resource Web-based and evaluating the utility of the online resource in clinical practice. © 2015 American Physical Therapy Association.",,"Wilson, P.N., Foreman, N., Stanton, D., Virtual reality, disability and rehabilitation (1997) Disabil Rehabil, 19, pp. 213-220; Laver, K., George, S., Thomas, S., Cochrane review: Virtual reality for stroke rehabilitation (2012) Eur J Phys Rehabil Med, 48, pp. 523-530; Saposnik, G., Levin, M., Virtual reality in stroke rehabilitation: A meta-analysis and implications for clinicians (2011) Stroke, 42, pp. 1380-1386; Mumford, N., Wilson, P.H., Virtual reality in acquired brain injury upper limb rehabilitation: Evidence-based evaluation of clinical research (2009) Brain Inj, 23, pp. 179-191; Galvin, J., McDonald, R., Catroppa, C., Erson, V., Does intervention using virtual reality improve upper limb function in children with neurological impairment: A systematic review of the evidence (2011) Brain Inj, 25, pp. 435-442; Parsons, T.D., Rizzo, A.A., Rogers, S., York, P., Virtual reality in paediatric rehabilitation: A review (2009) Dev Neurorehabil, 12, pp. 224-238; Sandlund, M., McDonough, S., Hager-Ross, C., Interactive computer play in rehabilitation of children with sensorimotor disorders: A systematic review (2009) Dev Med Child Neurol, 51, pp. 173-179; Biddiss, E., Should we integrate video games into home-based rehabilitation therapies for cerebral palsy?

Box 642132, Pullman, WA, United States","Secondary schools across the United States are adopting response to intervention (RTI) as a means to identify Stud.s with learning disabilities (LD) and provide tiered instructional interventions that benefit all Stud.s. The majority of current RTI research focuses on Stud.s with reading difficulties in elementary school classrooms. Recommendations for practice that stem from this empirical work are not generalizable to high school classrooms, where adolescents with LD experience unique learning challenges. This is especially true in secondary science classes, where an emphasis on complex vocabulary and sophisticated phenomenological investigations places added cognitive requirements on these Stud.s.This article presents a foundation for conceptualizing the role of technology in RTI implementation at the secondary level. We examine how video games can enhance RTI instructional practices by providing multiple tiers of academic supports and realtime progress monitoring in secondary science classrooms. The article illustrates how evidence-based practices can be included in the games in a manner that increases intervention fidelity and assessment reliability. While this article focuses on science video games, we contend that there is considerable conceptual overlap among high school science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses that will allow for further expansion of this discussion. The article concludes with recommendations for future research. © 2010 Council for Learning Disabilities.",,"(2008) The Alliance for Access to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, , http://www.washington.edu/doit/Stem/disability_type.html, AccessSTEM September 20, 2008; Alston, R.J., Bell, T.J., Hampton, J.L., Learning disability and career entry into the sciences: A critical factor analysis of attitudinal factors (2002) Journal of Career Development, 28, pp. 263-275; (2008) Benchmarks for Science Literacy, , http://www.project2061.org/publications/bsl/online/index.php, American Association for the Advancement of Science Retrieved December 15, 2009; Barnes, A.C., Harlacher, J.E., Clearing the confusion: Response-to-intervention as a set of principles (2008) Education and Treatment of Children, 31 (3), pp. 417-431; Barton, R., Stepanek, J., Three tiers to success (2009) Principal Leadership, 9 (8), pp. 16-20; Beaumont, R., Sofronoff, K., A multi-component social skills intervention for children with Asperger Syndrome: The junior detective training program (2008) Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 49 (7), pp. 743-753; Berkeley, S., Bender, W.N., Peaster, L.G., Saunders, L., Implementation of response to intervention (2009) Journal of Learning Disabilities, 42 (1), pp. 85-95; Brozo, W.G., Response to intervention or responsive instruction?

As League of Legends gameplay model is nowadays highly popular amid online video games, the proposed system can be easily generalized and adopted by other online video games that are currently popular among gamers. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","E-Sport; Game design; Matchmaking; Online games; Ranking systems","Blackburn, J., Kwak, H., Stfu noob!: Predicting crowdsourced decisions on toxic behavior in online games (2014) Proceedings of the 23Rd International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 877-888. , International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee; Bradley, R.A., Terry, M.E., Rank analysis of incomplete block designs: I.

Although the ways in which we interact with games have improved over recent years, the interaction is still limited to their functions and game presets and still happens inside the screen. In this paper we explore new interaction paradigms using i.Ge [4], a video game level editor that allows users to interact with their own environment to create game content with every-day physical objects in real time. At this stage, i.Ge explores new ways to interact with the real world by augmenting it with interactive projections, reducing the gap between the real and the digital world in a spatial augmented reality. We also propose other novel naturalistic approaches to create and interact with digital content that involve embodiment and more use of depth.","Game design; HCI; Interactive projection; Mixed reality; Spatial augmented reality; Tangible interaction","Jones, B.R., Sodhi, R., Campbell, R.H., Garnett, G., Bailey, B.P., Build your world and play in it: Interacting with surface particles on complex objects (2010) 9th International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR), pp. 165-174. , IEEE; Jones, B.R., Benko, H., Ofek, E., Wilson, A.D., IllumiRoom: Peripheral projected illusions for interactive experiences (2013) Proc.

This article questions who is able to lay claim to titles like 'fan' or 'gamer', how those titles are being contested along gendered, racialized, sexualized, and classed lines, what happens when new groups lay claim to those titles, and how some fans are reacting to the loss of their privileged relationships with content producers. I look at fan responses to North American game developer BioWare's decision to diversify games like Star Wars: The Old Republic and Dragon Age II by adding the option to play as a gay male character. I discovered that what was often framed by fans as a desire to prevent politics from leaking into gaming and ruining its unique attractions manifested as the maintenance of a heterocentric construction of the gamer identity. © The Author(s) 2014.","BioWare; Convergence culture; Embodiment; Fan studies; Feminist video game studies; Gamer culture; GLBTQ; Privilege; Queer theory; Star Wars","Althusser, L., (1972) Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays, pp. 127-186. , New York, NY: Monthly Review Press;; Anders, C.J., The real problem with midichlorians (2010) Io9, , http://io9.com/5478314/the-real-problem-with-midichlorians, (accessed 6 August 2013); Anderson, A., Openly gay athletes: Contesting hegemonic masculinity in a homophobic environment (2002) Gender and Society, 16 (6), pp. 860-877; Ashral, [SWTOR] Game testing closed and official forums wiped for launch (2011) Red Rancor, , http://www.redrancor.com/category/articles/swtor/swtor-game-testing-closed-and-official-forums-wiped-launch, (accessed 5 December 2011); Barlow, J.P., A declaration of the independence of cyberspace (1996) Electronic Frontier Foundation, , https://projects.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html, (accessed 8 February 2011); Bastal, BioWare neglected their core audience: The straight male gamer Message 1 (2011) BioWare Social Network, , http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/141/index/6603345/1, (accessed 5 November 2012); Bertozzi, E., 'You play like a girl!'
