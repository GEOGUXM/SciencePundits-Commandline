The complete reliance on fossil fuels is recognized as unsustainable throughout the world, and this is due to, amongst others, the rapid declining of fossil fuel reserves and the emission of significant quantities of greenhouse gases associated with their production and combustion. This has resulted in escalating interest in research activities aiming to develop alternative and somewhat carbon neutral energy sources. Algal biofuels, so called third generation biofuels, appear to be promising in delivering sustainable and complementary energy platforms essential to formulate a major component of the renewable and sustainable energy mix for the future. Algal biomass can be converted into various portfolios of biofuel products, such as bio-hydrogen, biodiesel, bioethanol and biogas, via two different pathways: biochemical and thermochemical pathways. Thermochemical conversion is considered as a viable method to overcome the existing problems related with biochemical conversion such as lengthy reaction time, low conversion efficiency by microbes and enzymes, and high production costs. This paper discusses process technologies for microalgae-to-biofuel production systems, focusing on thermochemical conversion technologies such as gasification, pyrolysis, and liquefaction. The benefits of exploiting upstream microalgal biomass development for bioremediation such as carbon dioxide mitigation and wastewater treatment are also discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioremediation;

Reducing this consumption would be useful given that non-renewable resources account for 70.3% of the source of this energy. We apply the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process with the benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks (BOCR) approach to select an optimal heating facility for the horticulture and stockbreeding sectors in Korea. We set 11 factors based on the BOCR approach and evaluate six heating options that use either fossil fuels or renewable energy (oil-fired boiler, coal-fired boiler, electricity heater, geothermal heat pump, aero-thermal heat pump, and wood pallet-fired boiler). From the energy and agricultural experts' perspectives, the geothermal heat pump is selected as the most appropriate heating source. While it requires the highest initial investment cost of all the options, the geothermal heat pump earned high scores on most other factors. Moreover, the aero-thermal heat pump and the wood pallet-fired boiler, which run on renewable energy, also scored relatively well. However, the oil-fired boiler, which currently has the predominant share of heating facilities in these sectors, ranked the lowest. The results show that the Korean government's energy policies regarding the agriculture industry have resulted in a distorted resource allocation. Thus, it would be prudent to phase out the tax exemption on petroleum products and discounts on electricity provided to this industry. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","BOCR approach; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Heating facility; Horticulture and stockbreeding","Korea Energy Economics Institute, (2012) Yearbook of energy statistics, , Korea Energy Economics Institute Uiwang [in Korean]; International Energy Agency, (2013) Energy prices and taxes, first quarter 2013, , International Energy Agency Paris; Heo, E., Kim, J., Cho, S., Selecting hydrogen production methods using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process with opportunities, costs, and risks (2012) Int J Hydrogen Energy, 37 (23), pp. 17655-17662; Yi, S.-K., Sin, H.-Y., Heo, E., Selecting sustainable renewable energy source for energy assistance to North Korea (2011) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 15, pp. 554-563; Sánchez-Lozano, J.M., Teruel-Solano, J., Soto-Elvira, P.L., García-Cascales, M.S., Geographical information systems (GIS) and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods for the evaluation of solar farms locations: Case study in south-eastern Spain (2013) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 24, pp. 544-556; Uyan, M., GIS-based solar farms site selection using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in Karapinar region, Konya/Turkey (2013) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 28, pp. 11-17; Lee, S.K., Mogi, G., Kim, J.W., Gim, B.J., A fuzzy analytic hierarchy process approach for assessing national competitiveness in the hydrogen technology sector (2008) Int J Hydrogen Energy, 33, pp. 6840-6848; Heo, E., Kim, J., Boo, K.-J., Analysis of the assessment factors for renewable energy dissemination program evaluation using fuzzy AHP (2010) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 14, pp. 2214-2220; Lee, S.K., Mogi, G., Hui, K.S., A fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP)/data envelopment analysis (DEA) hybrid model for efficiently allocating energy R&D resources: in the case of energy technologies against high oil prices (2013) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 21, pp. 347-355; Saaty, T.L., (1980) The analytic hierarchy process: planning, priority setting, resource allocation, , McGraw-Hill International Book Co.

However, bioenergy's impact on climate change remains incomplete when land use changes (LUC), soil organic carbon (SOC) changes, and the auxiliary energy consumption are not accounted for in the life cycle. Using data collected from Belgian farmers, combined heat and power (CHP) operators, and a life cycle approach, we compared 40 bioenergy pathways to a fossil-fuel CHP system. Bioenergy required between 0.024 and 0.204MJ (0.86MJ<inf>th</inf>+0.14 MJ<inf>el</inf>)-1, and the estimated energy ratio (energy output-to-input ratio) ranged from 5 to 42. SOC loss increased the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of residue based bioenergy. On average, the iLUC represented ~67% of the total GHG emissions of bioenergy from perennial energy crops. However, the net LUC (i.e., dLUC+iLUC) effects substantially reduced the GHG emissions incurred during all phases of bioenergy production from perennial crops, turning most pathways based on energy crops to GHG sinks. Relative to fossil-fuel based CHP all bioenergy pathways reduced GHG emissions by 8-114%. Fluidized bed technologies maximize the energy and the GHG benefits of all pathways. The size and the power-to-heat ratio for a given CHP influenced the energy and GHG performance of these bioenergy pathways. Even with the inclusion of LUC, perennial crops had better GHG performance than agricultural and forest residues. Perennial crops have a high potential in the multidimensional approach to increase energy security and to mitigate climate change. The full impacts of bioenergy from these perennial energy crops must, however, be assessed before they can be deployed on a large scale. © 2015 The Authors.","Fixed and fluidized bed CHPs; Life cycle assessment; Perennial crops; Residues","(2009), EU, Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC.

However, after the alarming decrease in the fossil fuels reserves, many have drawn their attentions back to a renewable energy technology, especially the wind energy. This paper presents some of the new designs that are being tested, including slotted blades and tubercles design models. The experimental results are used to validate the numerical studies that are being conducted parallel to the experiments for better understanding and more detailed results. The new slotted blade design produced more power compared to the straight blade for lower wind speeds, while the tubercle blades showed better power performance in severe wind conditions and a more steady behavior under unsteady and higher wind velocities.

Airborne PM is a mixture of solid and liquid droplets suspended in air. It consists of organic and inorganic components, and the particles of concern range in size from a few nanometers to approximately 10. μm. The complexity of PM is considered to be the reason for the poor understanding of PM and may also be the reason why PM in environmental impact assessment is poorly defined. Currently, life cycle impact assessment is unable to differentiate highly toxic soot particles from relatively harmless sea salt. The aim of this article is to present a new impact assessment for PM where the impact of PM is modeled based on particle physico-chemical properties. With the new method, 2781 characterization factors that account for particle mass, particle number concentration, particle size, chemical composition and solubility were calculated. Because particle sizes vary over four orders of magnitudes, a sound assessment of PM requires that the exposure model includes deposition of particles in the lungs and that the fate model includes coagulation as a removal mechanism for ultrafine particles. The effects model combines effects from particle size, solubility and chemical composition. The first results from case studies suggest that PM that stems from emissions generally assumed to be highly toxic (e.g. biomass combustion and fossil fuel combustion) might lead to results that are similar compared with an assessment of PM using established methods. However, if harmless PM emissions are emitted, established methods enormously overestimate the damage. The new impact assessment allows a high resolution of the damage allocatable to different size fractions or chemical components. This feature supports a more efficient optimization of processes and products when combating air pollution. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Ambient air pollution; Chemical particle properties; Life cycle impact assessment modeling; Particulate matter; Physical particle properties","Andersen, Z.J., Wahlin, P., Raaschou-Nielsen, O., Ketzel, M., Scheike, T., Loft, S., Size distribution and total number concentration of ultrafine and accumulation mode particles and hospital admissions in children and the elderly in Copenhagen, Denmark (2008) Occup.

A number of prospective tidal energy sites have been identified, but the local hydrodynamics of these sites are often poorly understood. Tidal energy developers rely on detailed characterisation of tidal energy sites prior to device installation and field trials. Although first-order appraisals may make macrotidal tidal straits appear attractive for development, detailed, site-specific hydrodynamic and bathymetric surveys are important for determining site suitability for tidal stream turbine (TST) installation. Understanding the ways in which coastal features affect tidal velocities at potential TST development sites will improve identification and analysis of physical constraints on tidal energy development. This paper presents and examines tidal velocity data measured in Ramsey Sound (Pembrokeshire, Wales, UK), an energetic macrotidal strait, which will soon host Wales' first TST demonstration project. While maximum tidal velocities in the strait during peak spring flood exceed 3ms-1, the northern portion of Ramsey Sound exhibits a marked flood-dominated tidal asymmetry. Furthermore, local bathymetric features affect flow fields that are spatially heterogeneous in three dimensions, patterns that depth-averaged velocity data (measured and modelled) tend to mask. Depth-averaging can therefore have a significant effect on power estimations. Analysis of physical and hydrodynamic characteristics in Ramsey Sound, including tidal velocities across the swept area of the pilot TST, variations in the stream flow with depth, estimated power output, water depth and bed slope, suggests that the spatial and temporal variability in the flow field may render much of Ramsey Sound unsuitable for tidal power extraction. Although the resource potential depends on velocity and bathymetric conditions that are fundamentally local, many prospective tidal energy sites are subject to similar physical and hydrodynamic constraints. Results of this study can help inform site selection in these complicated, highly dynamic macrotidal environments.

This paper presents the offshore wind resource map of the Gulf of Thailand, with the objective of identifying the potential areas for grid connected offshore wind power development. A coupled numerical mesoscale atmospheric model and a microscale wind flow model, along with long-term global reanalysis climate data, are used to generate high resolution (200m) wind resource maps at heights of 40m, 80m, 100m, and 120m above sea level. The offshore wind resource maps are validated using measured wind speeds obtained from 28 meteorological towers installed along the coast of the Gulf of Thailand. The site selection of potential areas for offshore wind power development is assessed with a multi-criteria decision making analysis. Specifically to the Bay of Bangkok, results show that a technical power potential in the order of 3000MW could be developed to generate an annual energy production estimated in the order of 6TWh/year. For the whole Gulf of Thailand, a technical power potential estimated at 7000MW could generate in the order of 15TWh/year. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Atmospheric modeling; Technical power potential; Wind energy; Wind power; Wind resource assessment","(2013) World energy outlook 2013, , http://www.iea.org, Available at:; (2013) Global wind report, annual market update, , http://www.gwec.net, Available at:; (2014) Climate change 2014-mitigation of climate change, , http://www.ipcc.ch, Available at:; Raadal, H.L., Vold, B.I., Myhr, A., Nygaard, T.A., GHG emission and energy performance of offshore wind power (2014) Renew Energy, 66, pp. 314-324; Chingulpitak, S., Wongwises, S., Critical review of the current status of wind power in Thailand (2014) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 31, pp. 312-318; Landry, M., Leclerc, A., Gagnon, Y., Amethodology for the evaluation of the economic impacts of wind energy projects in Canada (2013) Energy Environ, 24, pp. 735-748; Katsigiannis, Y.A., Stavrakakis, G.S., Estimation of wind energy production in various sites in Australia for different wind turbine classes: a comparative technical and economic assessment (2014) Renew Energy, 67, pp. 230-236; Abbasi, T., Premalatha, M., Abbasi, T., Abbasi, S.A., Wind energy: increasing deployment, rising environmental concerns (2014) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 31, pp. 270-288; Perveen, R., Kishor, N., Mohanty, S.R., Off-shore wind farm development: present status and challenges (2014) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 29, pp. 780-792; Adelaja, A., McKewon, C., Calnin, B., Hailu, Y., Assessing offshore wind potential (2012) Energy Policy, 42, pp. 191-200; Zheng, C.W., Pan, J., Assessment of the global ocean wind energy resource (2014) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 33, pp. 382-391; Waewsak, J., Landry, M., Gagnon, Y., High resolution wind atlas for Nakhon Si Thammarat and Songkhla provinces, Thailand (2013) Renew Energy, 53, pp. 101-110; Hernandez Escobedo, Q., Saldana Flores, R., Rodriguez Garcia, E.R., Manzano Agugliaro, F., Wind energy resource in northern Mexico (2014) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 32, pp. 890-914; Fang, H.F., Wind energy potential assessment for the offshore areas of Taiwan west coast and Penghu Archipelago (2014) Renew Energy, 67, pp. 237-241; Santos-Alamillos, F.J., Pozo-Vazequez, D., Ruiz-Arias, J.A., Lara-Fanego, V., Tovar-Pescador, J., Amethodology for evaluating the spatial variability of wind energy resources: application to assess the potential contribution of wind energy to base load power (2014) Renew Energy, 69, pp. 145-156; Oh, K.Y., Kim, J.Y., Lee, J.K., Ryu, M.S., Lee, J.S., Assessment of wind energy potential at the demonstration offshore wind farm in Korea (2012) Energy, 46, pp. 555-563; Sheridan, B., Baker, S.D., Pearre, N.S., Firestone, J., Kempton, W., Calculating the offshore wind power resource: robust assessment methods applied to the U.S. Atlantic coast (2012) Renew Energy, 43, pp. 224-233; Beaucage, P., Lafrance, G., Lafrance, J., Choisnard, J., Bernier, M., Synthetic aperture radar satellite data for offshore wind assessment: a strategic sampling approach (2011) JWind Eng Ind Aerodynamics, 99, pp. 27-36; Jiang, D., Zhuang, D., Huang, Y., Wang, J., Fu, J., Evaluating the spatio-temporal variation of China's offshore wind resources based on remotely sensed wind field data (2013) Renew Energy Sustain Rev, 24, pp. 142-148; Dhanju, A., Whitaker, P., Kempton, W., Assessing offshore wind resources: an accessible methodology (2008) Renew Energy, 33, pp. 55-64; Moller, B., Hong, L., Lonsing, R., Hvelplund, F., Evaluation of offshore wind resources by scale of development (2012) Energy, 48, pp. 314-322; Xiliang, Z., Da, Z., Stua, M., Kickoff of offshore wind power in China: playoffs for China wind power development (2012) Proc Environ Sci, 12, pp. 166-173; Prassler, T., Schaechtele, J., Comparison of the financial attractiveness among prospective offshore wind parks in selected European countries (2012) Energy Policy, 45, pp. 86-101; http://sql.ldd.go.th/ldddata/, map scale 1:50000.

In the literature, there are different methodologies for its modeling, but this study suggests the harmonic analysis application to solar irradiation and sunshine duration data for more refined relevant prediction of solar irradiation. The basis of the methodology is combined application of the HARmonic and the classical LINear regression analyses, and therefore, it is referred to as the HarLin model. It isolates first the periodicity from the daily averages of records and then the linear regression analysis is applied elegantly to first order stationary data. The results are tested and compared with the Adaptive-Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model based on the Sugeno fuzzy logic inference system and Angström-Prescott model in the form of a linear regression analysis. In the application, three solar irradiation sites are considered from different solar energy potential locations in Turkey, namely, at Adana, Gaziantep and Silifke cities. The predictions by the HarLin model appear more successful than ANFIS and the classical Angström-Prescott approaches. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","ANFIS model; Angström-Prescott equation; Harmonic analysis; Solar irradiation; Sunshine duration","Akinoğlu, B.G., Ecevit, A., Construction of a quadratic model using modified Angström coefficients to estimate global solar radiation (1990) Sol Energy, 45, pp. 85-92; Almorox, J., Bocco, M., Willington, E., Estimation of daily global solar radiation from measured temperatures at Cañada de Luque, Córdoba, Argentina (2013) Renew Energy, 60, pp. 382-387; Amato, U., Andretta, A., Banoli, B., Coluzzi, B., Cuomo, V., Fontana, F., Markov processes and Fourier analysis as a tool describe and simulate daily solar irradiance (1986) Sol Energy, 37 (3), pp. 179-194; Angström, A., Solar terrestrial radiation (1924) QJ R Meteorological Soc, 50, pp. 121-126; Baldasano, J.M., Clar, J., Berna, A., Fourier analaysis of daily solar radiation data in Spain (1988) Sol Energy, 41 (4), pp. 327-334; Balling, R., Cerveny, R.S., Spatial and temporal variations in long-term normal percent possible solar radiation levels in the United States (1983) JClim Appl Met, 22, pp. 1726-1732; Benghanem, M., Mellit, A., Alamri, S.N., ANN-based modelling and estimation of daily global solar radiation data: a case study (2009) Energy Convers Manag, 50, pp. 1644-1655; Chen, S.X., Gooi, H.B., Wang, M.Q., Solar radiation forecast based on fuzzy logic and neural networks (2013) Renew Energy, 60, pp. 195-201; Dogniaux, R., Lemoine, M., Classification of radiation sites in terms of different indices of atmospheric transparency (1983) Solar energy data.

The Isle of Eigg in Scotland has been successfully using a hybrid off-grid system for several years to provide a reliable 24-h electricity supply to the islanders. This ex-post analysis of the Isle of Eigg system investigates its performance and explores possible alternative configurations which could work more effectively and efficiently. Simulations were carried out using HOMER software for the existing system and for alternative configurations of energy generation. It is found that the existing overcapacity has been instrumental in ensuring a reliable supply but continued reliance on diesel generators adds to the cost. More wind power capacity addition can reduce reliance on fossil fuels and modular sizing of generators instead of adding large capacities could have reduced the idle capacity. This experience suggests that providing reliable off-grid electricity supply is possible but is costly without suitable capital subsidies. Appropriate system design suited to the local condition is important for developing a viable system. © 2015 The Authors.","Hybrid system; Isle of eigg; Off-grid electricity; Reliable supply","(2013) World energy outlook, energy access database, , http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/resources/energydevelopment/energyaccessdatabase/#d.en.8609, [online] EIA.

As the most abundant component of lignocellulosic biomass, cellulose, which is a linear polymer formed by the repeating connection of glucose units through β-1,4-glycosidic linkages, is considered to be an inexhaustible raw material for the sustainable production of chemicals and fuels. For the effective utilization of cellulose, the primary and essential step is the hydrolysis of cellulose into glucose. Although homogeneous acids and cellulases are the most common catalysts for the hydrolysis of cellulose into glucose, they possess a series of problems such as reactor corrosion, waste treatment and poor recyclability and high cost, low efficiency and long reaction time, respectively. In order to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks, solid acid catalysts have been increasingly employed for the hydrolysis of cellulose into glucose in recent years. In this review, the state-of-the-art studies on the hydrolysis of cellulose into glucose over various types of solid acid catalysts such as acid resins, metal oxides, H-form zeolites, heteropoly acids, functionalized silicas, supported metals, immobilized ionic liquids, carbonaceous acids and magnetic acids are systematically summarized. Meanwhile, reaction medias, auxiliary methods and neoteric strategies for the hydrolysis of cellulose into glucose are intensively discussed. Furthermore, some potential research trends in the future are also prospected to provide some valuable ideas for the hydrolysis of cellulose into glucose in a more green, simple, efficient and inexpensive way. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cellulose; Glucose; Hydrolysis; Lignocellulosic biomass; Solid acid catalysts","Luterbacher, J.S., Rand, J.M., Alonso, D.M., Han, J., Youngquist, J.T., Maravelias, C.T., Pfleger, B.F., Dumesic, J.A., (2014) Science, 343, pp. 277-280; Zhou, C.H., Xia, X., Lin, C.X., Tong, D.S., Beltramini, J., (2011) Chem.

DIN deposition exhibited an increasing gradient from north to south, with N-NH4+ as the predominant contributor. DIN deposition in precipitation changed after interaction with the forest canopy, and serious ecological perturbations are expected in this region. DIN deposition presented seasonal fluctuations, which might be ascribed to agricultural activity, fossil-fuel combustion and environmental factors (i.e., wind direction, soil temperature). Notably, N fertilizer use (F<inf>N</inf>), energy consumption (E), and precipitation (P) jointly explained 84.3% of the spatial variation in DIN deposition, of which F<inf>N</inf> (27.2%) was the most important, followed by E (24.8%), and finally P (9.3%). The findings demonstrate that DIN deposition is regulated by precipitation mainly via anthropogenic N emissions, and this analysis provides decision-makers a novel view for N pollution abatement. ©2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The transportation technologies based on cleaner and renewable alternative fuels can play a major role in mitigating the green house effect and improving the urban air quality. In the present work, a hybrid multicriteria methodology is developed using graph theory and analytic hierarchy process methods for the performance assessment of conventional and non-conventional transportation fuels on the basis of multiple criteria. The proposed fuel suitability digraph presents a graphical visualization of alternative fuel selection attributes and their interrelations. The fuel preference index obtained from matrix permanent function provides a total objective value for comparison of alternative fuel options. Analytic hierarchy process is employed to assign the relative weights to the fuel selection attributes. Three examples are considered in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed methodology. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Among others, alcohols: methanol and ethanol are proposed as satisfactory fuels, that would be applied either as single fuels or blended with gasoline o diesel fuel. The paper describes impact of both methanol and E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) as additional fuels added to a diesel fueled engine on its combustion characteristics and exhaust toxic emission. These fuels were added by injection into an intake manifold in amounts expressed by their energy percentage of 20%, 50%, 75% and 90% with respect to total diesel fuel-methanol or diesel fuel-E85 blends. The tests in a compression ignition engine contained analysis of heat release rate and combustion parameters as well as analysis of exhaust toxic emission NO<inf>x</inf>, THC, CO and soot. It was observed that with increase in methanol or E85 peak combustion temperature decreases as well as temperature of the mixture at the end of compression stroke that affects combustion duration. For methanol or E85 two characteristic peaks in the heat release rate profile were observed. The first peak represents burning the diesel fuel and the second burning methanol or E85. Hence, diesel fuel injection timing should be corrected, if alcohols, even in small amounts, are applied. Furthermore, as advantage, slight increase in brake efficiency was observed. Next, radical reduction in soot, particularly at 50% alcohol (methanol or E85) addition was also managed as important advantage. On the other hand, increase by 16% in NO<inf>x</inf> emission was observed, while 20% methanol or E85 were added.

Different from fossil diesel which mainly consists of hydrocarbons, biodiesels are oxygenated fuels. Oxygen contained in biodiesels, as an oxidizing enhancer, plays a crucial role in improving the auto-ignition quality. The oxygen enrichment coming from biodiesels causes the fuel-air mixture in the auto-ignition zone where the mixture is quite rich to become leaner, consequently improving combustion and emission quality. As such, a quantitative analysis of the impact of oxygen content in biodiesel-diesel blends in engine combustion and emission concentrations is crucial in giving key clues to fuel manufacturing as well as to internal combustion engine modeling. This study aims to establish a link between the oxygen content and engine performance as well as emission concentrations when using biodiesel blends B0, B10 and B20 (0%, 10% and 20% of biodiesel by volume in biodiesel-diesel mixtures, respectively). The biodiesel was derived from residues of the manufacturing process of palm cooking oil using methanol transesterification with the aid of a high hardness solid ceramic metal catalyst. The engine used in this test is a modern common-rail, single-cylinder engine operating under a fixed injection condition (injection timing, pressure and duration) but with a wide range of engine speeds. The results show that the oxygen enrichment coming from the fuel blends tested in this study lowers the engine power which is attributable to lower heating values of the biodiesel blends compared with that of the fossil diesel. However, the oxygen contained in the blends suppresses particle formation and decreases hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide concentrations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To reduce this uncertainty, we here quantify two questions for the power system of Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland): First, when compared within the same high-resolution modeling framework, how much do different combinations of technologies differ in these three respects? Second, how strongly does the cost and availability of grid-scale storage affect overall system cost, and would it favor some technology combinations above others? We compare three main possible generation technologies: (1) renewables, (2) nuclear, and (3) fossil fuels (with/without carbon capture and storage). Our results show that across a wide range of these combinations, the overall costs remain similar, implying that different configurations are equally feasible both technically and economically. However, the most economically favorable scenarios are not necessarily favorable in terms of emissions or energy security. The availability of grid-scale storage in scenarios with little dispatchable generation can reduce overall levelized electricity cost by up to 50%, depending on storage capacity costs. The UK can rely on its domestic wind and solar PV generation at lower renewable shares, with levelized costs only rising more than 10% above the mean of 0.084 GBP/kWh for shares of 50% and below at a 70% share, which is 35% higher. However, for more than an 80% renewable generation share to be economically feasible, large-scale storage, significantly more power imports, or domestic dispatchable renewables like tidal range must be available. © 2015 The Authors.","Energy policy;

Development of alternative fuels is expected to play a pivotal role during the forthcoming decades. These alternative fuels, in general, are free from green house gases, which are almost responsible for global warming among all other effects. Introduction of newer alternative fuels is surely to enhance the quality of life across the world. Use and reuse of alternative fuels to a greater extent for the benefit of our society is a great challenge as well as an opportunity for engineers. The present study aims at choosing one of the most suitable alternative fuels, which would perform well in relation to various attributes. The most appropriate fuel out of five alternatives has been chosen by using multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methodologies. Weightage of each criterion is determined by using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and ranks of the alternatives have been calculated by using MOORA and PROMETHEE methods. The alternative A<inf>4</inf>, which is Mahua blend is the most appropriate alternative fuel for this present study since it has been ranked first by both the MCDM methods. The performance of both the methods is judged by finding Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Therefore, MCDM methodologies can be utilised to select the best alternative fuel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Undesirably, the excessive usage of fossil fuels releases harmful gases which can cause serious environmental problems. A potential solution to curb the fossil fuel consumption and environmental problems is the utilization of renewable energy such as solar energy. Malaysia has abundant solar energy resources throughout the year due to its location near to equator, promises the highest beneficial in using solar energy for technology development such as solar water heater (SWH). However, people in Malaysia are not aware of SWH's benefits due to high initial installation cost of SWH. Thus, this study presents financial evaluation of SWH in Malaysia which takes into account cost benefit and payback period of using SWH. The benefits are reanalysed bases on annual effective solar radiation. The result reveals that the utilization of a SWH can save up to RM 704 of energy cost per year. The payback periods of a SWH in Malaysia vary from 7.4 to 10.7 years, depending on the initial installation cost of SWH. Promoting the use of SWH by all EWH's owners in Malaysia can save 2 billion kWh of electricity and notably prevent emissions of 1,560,370 t CO<inf>2</inf>, 11,830 t SO<inf>2</inf>, and 4930 t NO<inf>x</inf> per year. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Values of δ14C varied from 211.7‰ in 1984 to 16.9‰ in 2013. The temporal δ14C variation can be described as an exponential decline, indistinguishable from the general Northern Hemisphere Zone 2 (NH Zone 2) values in the atmosphere, until at least 1994. Values of δ14C for 1999 and 2004 are slightly depleted compared with NH Zone 2 values, while from 1999 to 2013 the data suggest a clear depletion with a 2-8ppmV additional CO<inf>2</inf> contribution from a 14C-free (i.e. fossil carbon) source. This change coincides with local traffic increases since two nearby expressways were opened in the 1990's. In addition, the small but visible 14C pulse observed in the 2011 tree-ring might be caused by release from the damaged reactors during the Fukushima nuclear accident. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Cellulose 14C; Cryptomeria japonica tree ring; Fossil fuel; Fukushima nuclear accident; Traffic effect","Buzinny, M., Likhtarev, I., Los, I., Talerko, N., Tsigankov, N., 14C analysis of annual tree rings from the vicinity of the Chernobyl NPP (1998) Radiocarbon, 40, pp. 373-379; Hopper, S.T., McCormac, F.G., Hogg, A.J., Higham, T.F.G., Head, M.J., Evalution of wood pretreatments on oak and cedar (1998) Radiocarbon, 40, pp. 45-50; Hua, Q., Barbetti, M., Rakowski, A.Z., Atmospheric radiocarbon for the period 1950-2010 (2013) Radiocarbon, 55, pp. 2059-2072; Kawamura, H., Kofuji, H., Gasa, S., Kamamoto, M., Sawafuji, N., Mori, M., 14C measurements of tree rings of a Japanese cedar during 1945 to 2000 and core sampling for environmental studies (2007) Radiocarbon, 49, pp. 1045-1053; Kim, C.K., Byun, J.I., Chae, J.S., Choi, H.Y., Choi, S.W., Kim, D.J., Kim, Y.J., Yun, J.Y., Radiological impact in Korea following the Fukushima nuclear accident (2012) J.Environ.

To help address these challenges, countries across the world are increasing the contribution made by renewable energy (RE) resources to their energy supplies. Feed-in Tariff (FiT) is one of the most effective incentive policies used to promote the RE sector especially at the micro-generation level. The key objective of the FiT schemes is to provide financial support to residential, industrial and commercial consumers to encourage them to become RE producers. Solar photovoltaic (PV) is one of the most promising RE technologies. This paper provides an overview of the solar PV developments in the Association of South East Asian Nation (ASEAN) countries. It reflects upon the RE trends in the world as well as providing an introduction to the ASEAN countries. It reviews the progress of solar PV in each of the ASEAN countries especially in terms of RE policies, growth in terms of PV installations and research and development activities. Finally, the paper presents conclusions and a set of recommendations. Out of the 10 ASEAN countries, 5 have implemented FiT as a key policy incentive to stimulate the progress of RE.

Biomass energy in Turkey is one of the most important renewable energy sources in terms of energy potential. Traditional biomass (wood and dung) in Turkey has a significant energy production rate. This ratio has been decreased with the decline of forests and the reduction seen in animal husbandry, recently. Traditional biomass is usually used in the form of non-commercial fuel and meets a quarter of the domestic energy production. Traditional biomass energy production has been planned 7530 Btep in 2020. In Turkey, the use of modern biomass energy is important in terms of the country's economy, and the environment pollution. Turkey has the potential to provide an alternative source of energy from the most appropriate and most cost-effective agricultural products according to its ecological conditions. Modern biomass started with 17 Btep in 2000. However, there has not been the foresight to future production. Whereas traditional biomass energy production should increasingly be reduced and modern biomass energy production should be increased. This situation will offer new investment fields to investors. This study shows that biomass energy continues to be the main source of energy for climate change mitigation and energy sustainability in Turkey, particularly in its traditional forms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Small plants able to use solid biomass, collected in the plant neighborhoods, are having a growing diffusion: University of Pisa jointly with some local manufactures has designed, built and tested an externally fired micro gas turbine (EFMGT) supplying 70kW of electricity as well as 200-250kW of useful heat. The present paper focuses on the development of a dynamic simulator of the plant. A mathematical model was implemented for the physical and chemical behavior of the biomass combustion process, as well as for heat transfer mechanisms and turbine behavior to assess the plant operating variables in both steady state and transient operating conditions.

This plan, coupled with the need to mitigate climate change and also find alternative energy options to fossil fuels, is expected to continuously lead to increased interests in the development of renewable energy systems, around the world. Such systems have the potential to address the energy deficit in the world's energy poor regions, e.g. sub-Saharan Africa, where about 50% of the 1.2 billion people in the world live without access to electricity. This paper first discusses the state-of-the-art of photovoltaic (PV) technologies worldwide. It then presents the development of solar panel plant, using the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI) 7.5 MW solar panel plant in Nigeria as a case study, which is established to build local capacity in PV technologies and also promote their widespread applications. The plant layout design, materials, equipment and production line are discussed. A new technique called Fundamental PV Module Performance Analysis (FPVMPA) is employed to assess the performance of a single NASENI 190 W module in terms of power output, energy yield, capture losses, fill factor, and efficiency, allowing the prediction of the module performance pre-installation, based on IEC 61724 standards. Furthermore, emphasis is laid on the impact of temperature on the module, which affects its efficiency and overall outputs. These analyses are then used to evaluate the performance of a 54.72 kW Photovoltaic Electric Power Generation Plant (PEPGP) that is proposed for a remote mini-estate in Kutunku, Nigeria. Future research directions are also provided on module life cycle analysis, end-of-life management and recycling. Results show the module performance under varying irradiance and temperature conditions, which can be useful for design, planning and application purposes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, current costs to produce electricity from CSP are not cost competitive as compared to the traditional energy generation technologies based on fossil fuels and nuclear. It is envisioned that development of high efficiency and high heat capacity thermal storage fluids will increase system efficiency, reduce structural storage volume, and hence, contribute to reducing costs. Particularly, with respect to CSP, current high temperature energy storage fluids, such as molten salts, are relatively limited in terms of their thermal energy storage capacity and thermal conductivity. The current work explores possibility of boosting the thermal storage capacity of molten salts through latent heat of added phase change materials. We studied the advantage of adding coated Zn micron-sized particles to alkali chloride salt eutectic for enhanced thermal energy storage. Zinc particles (0.6μm and 5μm) obtained from commercial source were coated with an organo-phosphorus shell to improve chemical stability and to prevent individual particles from coalescing with one another during melt/freeze cycles. Thermal cycling tests (200 melt/freeze cycles) showed that coated Zn particles have good thermal stability and are chemically inert to alkali chloride salt eutectic in both N2 and in air atmospheres. Elemental mapping of the cross-sectional view of coated Zn particles from the composite after thermal cycles showed no signs of oxidation, agglomeration or other type of particle degradation. The measured enhancement in volumetric thermal storage capacity of the composite with just ~10 vol% of coated Zn particles over the base chloride salt eutectic varies from 15% to 34% depending on cycling temperature range (δT=50°C-100°C). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Encapsulation; Eutectic salt; Phase change; Thermal conductivity; Thermal energy storage; Zinc","(2011) Its potential contribution for a sustainable energy future, European academies science advisory council policy report 16; Herrmann, U., Kearney, D.W., Survey of thermal energy storage for parabolic trough power plants (2002) JSol Energy Eng Trans ASME, 124, pp. 145-152; (2010) Global concentrated solar power markets and strategies: 2010-2025, , IHS, Cambridge, MA; Yang, M., Yang, X., Yang, X., Ding, J., Heat transfer enhancement and performance of the molten salt receiver of a solar power tower (2010) Appl Energy, 87. , 2808e11; Choi, S.U.S., Enhancing thermal conductivity of fluids with nanoparticles (1995) ASME-Publications-Fed, 231, pp. 99-106; Shin, D., Banerjee, D., Enhancement of specific heat capacity of high-temperature silica-nanofluids synthesized in alkali chloride salt eutectics for solar thermal-energy storage applications (2011) Int J Heat Mass Transf, 54, pp. 1064-1070; Steinmann, W.-D., Eck, M., Laing, D., Solar thermal parabolic trough power plants with integrated storage capacity (2005) Int J Energy Technol Policy, 3. , 123-336; Zalba, B., Marin, J.M., Cabeza, L.F., Mehling, H., Review on thermal energy storage with phase change, heat transfer analysis and applications (2003) Appl Therm Eng, 23, pp. 251-283; Chen, J.C.H., Encapsulated phase change thermal energy storage materials (1985)Colvin, D.P., Enhanced thermal management using encapsulated phase change materials an overview (1999) Adv Heat Mass Trans Biotechnol, pp. 199-206. , HTD-Vol. 363, BED-Vol. 44; Hoshi, A., Mills, D.R., Bittar, A., Saitoh, T.S., Screening of high melting point phase change materials (PCM) in solar concentrating technology based on CLFR (2005) Sol Energy, 79 (3), pp. 332-339; Cingarapu, S., Singh, D., Timofeeva, E.V., Moravek, M.R., Nanofluids with encapsulated tin nanoparticles for Advanced heat transfer and thermal energy storage (2014) Int.

A novel simulation tool for solar-assisted ground-source heat-pumps (SGSHP) is presented with an analysis of the influence of solar collectors on the improvement of heat pump performance. Solar radiation and climate temperature data of 19 European cities were used to perform simulations of SGSHP and GSHP systems considering a typical residential house. Overall performance coefficients (COPsys) varied from northern to southern locations between 4.4 and 5.8 for SGSHP and between 4.3 and 5.1 for GSHP. Results show that solar collectors coupling has more impact on performance improvement in regions that benefit from higher irradiance. However, greater running cost savings are achieved in milder climate conditions. Both heat-pump systems are able to effectively contribute to carbon footprint reductions for residential buildings, especially in countries where fossil fuels are the primary source of electricity generation. SGSHP payback periods are found between 8.5 and 23 years from northern to southern localities, making such heating system an economic heating option. SGSHPs are best suited for high irradiance and cool climate locations such as the mountainous regions in southern Europe. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Building space heating; Energy efficiency; Ground-source heat pump;

The surface snow samples were analyzed for the major water-soluble ions (SO42-, NO3-, F-, Cl-, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and NH4+) and trace element (Al, As, Mn, V, Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, Fe, Cr, and Ni). The results indicated that the higher concentrations of NO3- and SO42- and the trace elements Zn, Pb, Cd, Ni, and Cu were likely attributable to enhanced local industrial emissions in East Asia especially in China. In addition, snow samples characterized by higher enrichment factors of trace elements (Cu, Cd, As, Zn, Pb) were indicative of an anthropogenic source. Emissions from fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning were likely important contributors to the chemical elements in seasonal snow with long-range transport. On the other hand, the large attribution of K+ appeared in the higher latitude demonstrated that biomass burning was a dominated factor of the chemical species in seasonal snow in the higher latitude of China than that in the lower latitude. Finally, an interannual comparison with the 2010 China snow survey also confirmed the source attributions of chemical speciation in seasonal snow in these regions. © 2015 Lanzhou University.","Enrichment factors; Seasonal snow; Trace elements; Water-soluble ions","Alfaro, S.C., Lafon, S., Rajot, J.L., Formenti, P., Gaudichet, A., Maille, M., Iron oxides and light absorption by pure desert dust: an experimental study (2004) J.Geophys.

Methods used to calculate fishing vessel emissions inventories have traditionally utilised estimates of fuel efficiency per unit of catch. These methods have weaknesses because they do not easily allow temporal and geographical allocation of emissions. A large proportion of fishing and other small commercial vessels are also omitted from global shipping emissions inventories such as the International Maritime Organisation's Greenhouse Gas Studies. This paper demonstrates an activity-based methodology for the production of temporally- and spatially-resolved emissions inventories using data produced by Automatic Identification Systems (AIS). The methodology addresses the issue of how to use AIS data for fleets where not all vessels use AIS technology and how to assign engine load when vessels are towing trawling or dredging gear. The results of this are compared to a fuel-based methodology using publicly available European Commission fisheries data on fuel efficiency and annual catch. The results show relatively good agreement between the two methodologies, with an estimate of 295.7 kilotons of fuel used and 914.4 kilotons of carbon dioxide emitted between May 2012 and May 2013 using the activity-based methodology. Different methods of calculating speed using AIS data are also compared. The results indicate that using the speed data contained directly in the AIS data is preferable to calculating speed from the distance and time interval between consecutive AIS data points. © 2015 The Authors.","Atmospheric pollution; Automatic identification systems (AIS); Greenhouse gas emissions; Shipping emissions inventory; UK fishing fleet","Buhaug, Ø., Corbett, J.J., Endresen, Ø., Eyring, V., Faber, J., Hanayama, S., Lee, D.S., Yoshida, K., (2009) Second IMO GHG Study 2009, , International Maritime Organization, London; Burt, J.E., Barber, G.M., (1996) Elementary Statistics for Geographers, , The Guildford Press, New York, U.S.A; Corbett, J.J., Köhler, H.W., Updated emissions from ocean shipping (2003) J.Geophys.

In this paper, Norouzak (Salvia lerifolia) seed oil is introduced as an indigenous source of biodiesel production in Iran. The seeds were collected from desert area of South Khorasan province Northeastern-Iran. In this regards, kinematic and dynamic viscosity, density, amount of free fatty acids, soap value, acid value and water content of the Noruzak oil are measured which are 28.435 (mP s), 31.433 (mm2/s), 0.9046 (g/cm2), 0.71%, 160.25 (mg/1 g), 1.4139 (mg) and 0/3% respectively. Also, fatty acid methyl esters C<inf>16:0</inf>, C<inf>16:1</inf>, C<inf>18:0</inf>, C<inf>18:1</inf>, C<inf>18:1c</inf>, C<inf>18:2</inf>, C<inf>18:2c</inf>, C<inf>18:3</inf>, C<inf>20</inf>, C<inf>20:1</inf>, C<inf>22</inf>, C<inf>22:1</inf>, C<inf>24</inf>, C<inf>24:1</inf> are known by Gas Chromatography (GC) and BF<inf>3</inf> method which results shows C<inf>18:2</inf> (40.8%) and C<inf>18:1</inf> (24) have the highest proportion of methyl ester in this oil. Norouzak biodiesel was obtained by basic trans-esterification method using ultrasounds device as a new sustainable and environmentally-friendly green technique under ultrasonic amplitude of 60% and 9 min at 45 °C, with methanol ratio of 1:5, 1:6, 1:7 and 1% potassium hydroxide as catalyst. The results showed that there is maximum performance of methyl ester production (97.60) with methanol molar ratio of 1:6 which shows significant improvement in the bio fuel production yield using ultrasound technology under the operating conditions. then, according to the EN 14124 standard, the quality of biodiesel such as flash point, oxidation stability at 110°C, density at 15°C, kinematic viscosity at 40°C, acid value and water content were determined and the values are 175.2 (°C), 6.54 (h), 883.675 (kg/m3), 0.5 (mg KOH/1 gOil) and 8/38 (mg/kg) respectively. Since the Norouzak biodiesel characteristics are complied with the EN 14214 standard, therefore Norouzak biodiesel can reliably be used in compression ignition engines. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To attain its comprehensive process characteristics, process simulation, thermodynamic assessment, and sensitivity analysis for oxy-steam combustion pulverized-coal-fired power plants are investigated whilst its corresponding CO<inf>2</inf>/O<inf>2</inf> recycled combustion (oxy-CO<inf>2</inf> combustion) power plant is served as the base case for comparison. Techno-economic evaluation and integration with solar parabolic trough collectors are also discussed to justify its economic feasibility and improve its thermodynamic performance further, respectively. It is found that oxy-steam combustion exhibits better performance than oxy-CO<inf>2</inf> combustion on both thermodynamic and economic aspects, in which the cost of electricity decreases about 6.62% whilst the net efficiency and exergy efficiency increase about 0.90 and 1.01 percentage points, respectively. The increment of oxygen concentration in oxidant (20-45 mol.%) and decrease of excess oxygen coefficient (1.01-1.09) in a certain range are favorable for improving oxy-steam combustion system performance.

Transitioning from a fossil fuel-based energy system to a system based on RES is a process in which the RES penetration must be guided by specific targets in the medium term. Moreover, the relative contributions from RES and fossil fuels in every stage of the transition process must be identified through clear optimization criteria. In this article, we propose a methodology denoted the Minimum Total Mix Capacity (MTMC) to determine the optimal mix of RES and fossil fuels in an electricity system by taking into account the hourly values of RES production and electricity demand. The MTMC methodology is applied to the Mexican electricity system, which greatly depends on fossil fuels. The Mexican Congress mandated that the fossil fuel-based electricity generation be limited to 65% by the year 2024, 60% by 2035 and 50% by 2050. We use the MTMC methodology to investigate the potential for RES integration into the Mexican electricity system by constructing three scenarios (low, mid and high biomass) to achieve the 2024 target and analyze the system's response to varying contributions of wind and solar power production to the scenarios. The minimum complementary capacity based on fossil fuels that is needed to cover the demand without electricity imports is assessed to determine the total mix capacity for the transition system. Using the MTMC methodology, several combinations of biomass, wind and solar power that achieve a minimum of 35% RES electricity production are identified; however, there is only one combination that results in the minimum overall capacity, hence resulting in the optimal mix. Moreover, a domain of near-optimal mix combinations can be identified among all of the scenarios, which may also be considered as an alternative. Biomass has the highest effectiveness in terms of high RES production and the lowest required overall power generating capacity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity system; Energy mix optimization; Energy systems analyses; Mexico; Renewable energy","Østergaard, P.A., Sperling, K., Towards sustainable energy planning and management (2014) Int J Sustainable Energy Plan Manage, 1, pp. 1-5; Secretariat of the Interior (SEGOB, Secretaría de Gobernación) (2008), pp. 95-102. , Law for use of renewable energies and financing of energy transition (Ley para el aprovechamiento de las energías renovables y el financiamiento de la transición energética), Official Diary of the Federation (DOF-Diario Oficial de la Federación) Mexico City, 28 NovemberProspective of the Electricity Sector 2012-2026 (Prospectiva del Sector Eléctrico 2012-2026) (2012), Mexico CityRenewable Energies Prospective 2012-2026 (Prospectiva de Energías Renovables 2012-2026).

These results are compared to cradle-to-grave life cycle analyses of the supercritical pulverized coal and integrated gasification combined cycle power generation plants, which are also performed as a part of this study. Life cycle inventories for each plant including the inputs (resources and fuels) and outputs (emissions and waste) of the gate-to-gate plants and their associated up- and down-stream sub-processes are computed. The impact of carbon capture and sequestration on each plant is quantified and assessed using the ReCiPe 2008 life cycle inventory method for three socioeconomic perspectives. The results of each coal plant are compared to one another and to plants generating power from natural gas at the end-point level. Results indicate that not only do coal-fed SOFCs generate power with a significantly lower life cycle impact than the current state-of-the-art coal plants, but when carbon capture is enabled they can do so with a lower impact than the most modern plants utilizing natural gas, as well. © 2015, Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Coal; Gasification; Life cycle analysis; Natural gas; Solid oxide fuel cells","(2013) Climate change 2013: the physical science basis.

However, the existence of energy rebound effects may completely or partially offset energy savings associated with technological advancement. From sectors perspective, technological advancement is not a necessary condition for energy conservation for a given sector because of varied rates of technological advancement and dependence among sectors. Adopting the input-output model, this article presents a detailed analysis of energy rebound effects in China's economy at the aggregate and sectoral level over 2006-2010. The results show that the aggregate sectors' rebound effect is about 11.31%, which is larger than without considering the interaction among sectors (11.25%); and strongly suggests that technological advancement has varied impacts on energy conservation and rebound effects. Thus various strategies of technological advancement and incorporated mitigation measures are necessary for energy conservation across sectors. Furthermore, the current study confirms that China's total value of fossil-fuel subsidies reached 160.23 billion US$ (constant 2005 price) in 2006-2010; and after removal of subsidies, the energy use is expected to save 411.35. million toe and the rebound effects for aggregate sectors become 10.64%.

Biofuels from microalgae, especially liquid fuels produced from saline microalgae lipids (oils), are seen as an important component of the future biofuels mix. In Australia, several companies and research groups are working on developing microalgal biofuels and whilst most are still in the research and development stage, recently constructed demonstration facilities highlight the potential for large-scale cultivation. Western Australia (WA) specifically, has several key advantages for large-scale microalgae for biofuel cultivation including abundant sunshine, extensive land area unsuitable for agriculture, an abundant water source in the Indian Ocean, existing infrastructure in several potential locations, high local demand for fuel and stable political conditions. The purpose of this study was to identify capable geographic locations for constructing large-scale microalgae for biofuel cultivation facilities in WA. Through the development of the Australian Algal Cultivation-Spatial Location Model (AAC-SLM) an examination of site specific parameters such as irradiance, temperature, CO<inf>2</inf> and nutrient availability, workability of soils, land-use and access to distribution infrastructure and a viable workforce, most capable locations for large-scale microalgae cultivation were identified in the state. Results indicate that large tracts of land along the central coast of Western Australia are ideal for cultivation development and could produce up to 11% of Australia's annual automotive diesel needs across the most suitable locations. The end result provides a robust method that can be tailored to the specific requirements and data availability of other regions within Australia and in other nations as a tool to attract future development through the identification of capable cultivation locations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Australia; Biofuels; Cultivation potential; Geographic information system; Microalgae","(2014), OECD-FAO agricultural outlook 2013-2022Borowitzka, M.A., Moheimani, N.R., Sustainable biofuels from algae (2013) Mitig Adapt Strat Global Change, 18, pp. 13-25; Rawat, I., Ranjith Kumar, R., Mutanda, T., Bux, F., Biodiesel from microalgae: a critical evaluation from laboratory to large scale production (2013) Appl Energy, 103, pp. 444-467; Stephens, E., Ross, I.L., King, Z., Mussgnug, J.H., Kruse, O., Posten, C., An economic and technical evaluation of microalgal biofuels (2010) Nat Biotechnol, 28, pp. 126-128; Wijffels, R.H., Barba, E., An outlook on microalgal biofuels (2010) Science, 329, pp. 796-799; Chisti, Y., Yan, J., Energy from algae: current status and future trends: algal biofuels - a status report (2011) Appl Energy, 88, pp. 3277-3279; Moheimani, N.R., Parlevliet, D., Sustainable solar energy conversion to chemical and electrical energy (2013) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 27, pp. 494-504; Da Silva, T.L., Gouveia, L., Reis, A., Integrated microbial processes for biofuels and high value-added products: the way to improve the cost effectiveness of biofuel production (2013) Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, pp. 1-11; Borowitzka, M.A., Moheimani, N.R., Open pond culture systems (2013) Algae for biofuels and energy, pp. 133-152. , Springer, Dordrecht, M.A. Borowitzka, N.R.

This investigation considers the impact of the Cryogenic Carbon Capture™ (CCC) process on transitional power generation. The CCC process consumes less energy than chemical and physical absorption processes and has an energy storage capability that shifts the parasitic loss of the CCC process away from peak hours. The CCC process responds rapidly to the variation of electricity demand and has a time constant that is consistent with the intermittent supply from renewable power sources. The hybrid system of conventional and renewable power generation units and the CCC process are optimized in this investigation. The system under consideration consists of load-following coal and gas-fired power units, a CCC process, and wind generation. The objective is to meet the residential and CCC plant electricity demands while maximizing the operating profit. The results demonstrate that an average profit of $35k/hr is obtained from this hybrid system over the selected days. The total electricity demand is best met using a combination of coal, gas, and wind power with grid-scale energy storage. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cryogenic Carbon Capture; Dynamic optimization; Fossil-fueled power production; Renewable energy generation","Key world energy statistics, , http://www.iea.org, [accessed November 2014]; Wang, Y., Ronilaya, F., Chen, X., Roskilly, A.P., Modelling and simulation of a distributed power generation system with energy storage to meet dynamic household electricity demand (2013) Appl Therm Eng, 50 (1), pp. 523-535; http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/global.html, [accessed November 2014]http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/co2.html, [accessed November 2014]http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/news_docs/pbl-2013-trends-in-global-co2-emissions-2013-report-1148.pdf, Tech. rep.

Water/steam injection is considered as one of the most popular power augmentation techniques because of its significant impact on the gas turbine performance. One of the recently suggested evaporative gas turbine cycles is the Maisotsenko open cycle for gas turbine power generation. In this paper, detailed thermodynamic analysis of this cycle is investigated with a thorough air saturator model. A comparative analysis is carried out to signify the advantages and disadvantages of Maisotsenko gas turbine cycle (MGTC) as compared with humid air gas turbine cycles. MGTC performance is evaluated based on a simple recuperated gas turbine cycle. In addition, sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the effect of different operating parameters on the overall cycle performance. Finally, integrating an air saturator instead of a conventional heat exchanger in recuperated gas turbine cycles enhances the power plant performance such that an efficiency enhancement of 7% points and net specific work output augmentation of 44.4% are obtained. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Air saturator; Humid gas turbine; Maisotsenko gas turbine cycle","Jonsson, M., Yan, J., Humidified gas turbines review of proposed and implemented cycles (2005) Energy, 30 (7), pp. 1013-1078; Walsh, P.P., Fletcher, P., (2004) Gas turbine performance, , Blackwell, Malden (MA), 2003063655 (OCoLC) 53306494 Walsh Philip P, Fletcher Paul. ill.; 26cm.

Consequently, seeking clean methods of producing electricity is a most crucial endeavor at this time. The shrinking reserves of oil have added urgency to the matter as well. One other recognized source of renewable energy besides wind, water, and solar (WWS) is geothermal energy, which has been proven to be useful in baseload power generation, a significant advantage over WWS. As compared to fossil fuels, geothermal energy is not subjected to the supply and cost fluctuations of which fuel is at risk. To date, there have been a number of innovative procedures explored to use geothermal energy to produce electricity. A relatively innovative yet not uncommon method has been to use hot solid rocks to heat water and pump the superheated water to use in power plants. These rocks are generally underground and at higher temperatures due to their proximity to volcanoes or natural geothermal vents. The water goes deeper down into the earth's crust to become superheated by the rocks, and then is pumped out to power turbines, and subsequently returned into the ground to repeat the process. In Krafla, Iceland, during their Icelandic Deep Drilling Project (IDDP) in 2009, a borehole was accidentally dug into the magma at 2100 m. The temperature of this magma was about 900-1000 °C. A steel casing with perforations on the flat side was cemented into the well bottom. This design was to slow the heat flow, and superheated steam was made for the following two years till July 2012. The steam reached temperatures of 450 °C and was at high pressures. Krafla was the world's first magma-enhanced geothermal system (EGS) to generate electricity. This paper will explore the feasibility of using geothermal power plant methods as a sustainable source of clean energy. Geothermal energy has tremendous potential if the right methods can be found to tap that potential, as well as if the cost may be brought down by innovation and demand. In addition, an innovative method, which already exists in some form, is proposed in the current review to harness more geothermal energy for use. © 2015 by ASME.",,"(2012) Renewables 2012 Global Status Report, , REN21, Paris, France, Report No. REN21; Figure 2.0 primary energy consumption by source and sector, 2011 (2011) Annual Energy Review, Last Accessed February, 28, p. 1. , EIA, 2014; Burgess, J., Volcanic shield can protect from eruptions and generate electricity (2013) Oilprice, Last Accessed February, 10, p. 1. , 2014; Foley, J.A., Earth's core temperature a hellish 6000 degrees celsius, new study confirms (2013) Nature World News, Last Accessed March, 1, p. 1. , 2014; (2010) Geothermal Energy, p. 1. , Anonymous, 2010, Newberry Geothermal, last accessed March 1, 2014; Lund, J.W., Boyd, T., Small geothermal power project examples (1999) Geo-Heat Center Bulletin, 20 (2), pp. 9-26; Bertani, R., Thain, I., (2002) Geothermal Power Generating Plant CO2 Emission Survey, p. 49. , IGA News; Lecher, C., (2013) Could A Volcano Power America?, p. 1. , Popular Science, last accessed February 8, 2014; Barnard, J., (2012) Newberry Volcano: Geothermal Energy Advocates in Oregon Have High Hopes, p. 1. , Huffpost Green, last accessed February 10, 2014; Phillips, A., (2014) Iceland, Magma Used to Create Geothermal Power for First Time, p. 1. , Thinkprogress, last accessed February 7, 2014; Pittalwala, I., (2014) World's First Magma-Enhanced Geothermal System Created in Iceland, p. 1. , UCR Today, last accessed February 8, 2014; Fridleifsson, I., Bertani, R., Huenges, E., (2008) The Possible Role and Contribution of Geothermal Energy to the Mitigation of Climate Change, , Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Lubeck, Germany; (2006) The Future of Geothermal Energy, , MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, INL/EXT-06-11746, Boston; Simkin, T., (2013) This Dynamic Planet, , http://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/2800/ion, retrieved March 11, 2014; (2014) Global Geothermal Supply and Demand, , http://jcwinnie.biz/wordpress/?p=2599, retrieved March 11; Rybach, L., Geothermal sustainability (2007) Geo-Heat Centre Quarterly Bulletin, 28. , Oregon Institute of Technology, Klamath Falls, OR; (2014) Geothermal Basics Current Use, , http://www.geo-energy.org/currentUse.aspx, retrieved March 11; (2012) Key World Energy Statistics, International Energy Agency, , IEA, Paris, France; 2013 Geothermal power: International market overview (2014) Geothermal Energy Association, , http://geo-energy.org/events/2013%20International%20Report%20Final.pdf, retrieved March 26; (2012) Cost and Performance Data for Power Generation Technologies, , http://bv.com/docs/reports-studies/nrel-cost-report.pdf, 20 Black and Veatch, Prepared for NREL, document February, 2012, retrieved June 24, 2014; Hillesheim, M., Mosey, G., (2013) Feasibility Study of Economics and Performance of Geothermal Power Generation at the Lakeview Uranium Mill Site in Lakeview, , Oregon Report No. NREL/TP-6A10-60251; Gerber, L., Marechal, F., (2012) Design of Geothermal Energy Conversion Systems with A Life Cycle Perspective, , The 37th Workshop Geothermal Reservoir Engineering Stanford University, Stanford, CA, January 30-February 1, Paper No. SGP-TR-194; Coskun, C., Oktay, Z., Dincer, I., Performance evaluations of a geothermal power plant (2011) Appl.

The assessment was conducted by considering the changes to eight major operating parameters, the flue gas acid dew point, and the fuel consumption rate. Optimization of the system was also considered to minimize the energy loss of the oxy-fuel process. The results suggest that air leakage exerts the largest impact on the output of the system. The half-dry RFG oxy-fuel system is the most practical due to its high efficiency and easiness in operation, compared with the other two flue gas recirculation modes. The acid dew point of the half-dry RFG system is about 10 °C higher than that of the dry RFG system and approximately 5°C lowers than the wet RFG system. For the optimization purpose, the improvement in the turbine system through utilizing the thermal energy of the hot flue gas is of prime importance. By heating the feed water at the outlet of the secondary feed water heater upstream of the deaerator and cooling down the hot flue gas to a temperature which is 10°C above its acid dew point, the net efficiency of an oxy-fuel process can raise by around 1.0%, which narrows the energy penalty to less than 10% compared to the reference air-firing system. This is smaller than an energy penalty of around 12% for the oxy-fuel process without the recovery of heat in the hot flue gas. It is also found that the efficiency elevation through the thermal integration with turbine system is greater for the wet model than the other two models. The oxy-fuel mode has a slightly larger net efficiency gain upon decreasing the fuel consumption rate from 600 MW to 300 MW. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Flue gas acid dew point; Oxy-fuel combustion; Process optimization; Sensitivity analysis","http://co2now.org/Current-CO2/CO2-Now/global-carbon-emissions.htmlKanniche, M., Gros-Bonnivard, R., Jaud, P., Valle-Marcos, J., Amann, J., Bouallou, C., Pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxy-combustion in thermal power plant for CO<inf>2</inf> capture (2010) Appl Therm Eng, 30 (1), pp. 53-62; Buhre, B.J.P., Elliott, L.K., Sheng, C.D., Gupta, R.P., Wall, T.F., Oxy-fuel combustion technology for coal-fired power generation (2005) Prog Energy Combust, 31 (4), pp. 283-307; Seepana, S., Jayanti, S., Steam-moderated oxy-fuel combustion (2010) Energy Convers Manage, 51 (10), pp. 1981-1988; Damen, K., Troost, M.V., Faaij, A., Turkenburg, W., A comparison of electricity and hydrogen production systems with CO<inf>2</inf> capture and storage Part A: Review and selection of promising conversion and capture technologies (2006) Prog Energy Combust, 32 (2), pp. 215-246; Andersson, K., Johnsson, F., Process evaluation of an 865 MWe lignite fired O<inf>2</inf>/CO<inf>2</inf> power plant (2006) Energy Convers Manage, 47 (1819), pp. 3487-3498; Xiong, J., Zhao, H., Chen, M., Zheng, C., Simulation study of an 800 MWe oxy-combustion pulverized-coal-fired power plant (2011) Energy Fuel, 25 (5), pp. 2405-2415; Kotowicz, J., Balicki, A., Enhancing the overall efficiency of a lignite-fired oxyfuel power plant with CFB boiler and membrane-based air separation unit (2014) Energy Convers Manage, 80, pp. 20-31; Rodewald, A., Kather, A., Frie, S., Thermodynamic and economic aspects of the hard coal based oxyfuel cycle (2005) Int J Green Energy, 2 (2), pp. 181-192; Pei, X., He, B., Yan, L., Wang, C., Song, W., Song, J., Process simulation of oxy-fuel combustion for a 300 MW pulverized coal-fired power plant using Aspen Plus (2013) Energy Convers Manage, 76, pp. 581-587; Hong, J., Chaudhry, G., Brisson, J.G., Field, R., Gazzino, M., Ghoniem, A.F., Analysis of oxy-fuel combustion power cycle utilizing a pressurized coal combustor (2009) Energy, 34 (9), pp. 1332-1340; Skorek-Osikowska, A., Bartela, L., Kotowicz, J., Job, M., Thermodynamic and economic analysis of the different variants of a coal-fired, 460 MW power plant using oxy-combustion technology (2013) Energy Convers Manage, 76, pp. 109-120; Xiong, J., Zhao, H., Zheng, C., Exergy analysis of a 600 MWe oxy-combustion pulverized-coal-fired power plant (2011) Energy Fuel, 25 (8), pp. 3854-3864; Levasseur, A.A., Chapman, P., Nsakala, N., Kluger, F., Alstom's oxy-firing technology development and demonstration-near term CO<inf>2</inf> solutions (2009) Proceedings of the 34th International Technical Conference on Clean Coal & Fuel Systems, , Florida USA; May 31-June 4; Kakaras, E., Doukelis, A., Giannakopoulos, D., Koumanakos, A., Economic implications of oxyfuel application in a lignite-fired power plant (2007) Fuel, 86 (14), pp. 2151-2158; Seepana, S., Jayanti, S., Optimized enriched CO<inf>2</inf> recycle oxy-fuel combustion for high ash coals (2012) Fuel, 102, pp. 32-40; Fleig, D., Normann, F., Andersson, K., Johnsson, F., Leckner, B., The fate of sulphur during oxy-fuel combustion of lignite (2009) GHGT9: Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies, , Washington, DC: USA; November 16-20; Wall, T., Liu, Y., Spero, C., Elliott, L., Khare, S., Rathnam, R., An overview on oxyfuel coal combustion-state of the art research and technology development (2009) Chem Eng Res des, 87 (8), pp. 1003-1016; http://www.thermoflow.com/convsteamcycle_TFX.htmlBirkestad, H., (2002) Separation and Compression of CO<inf>2</inf> in An O<inf>2</inf>/CO<inf>2</inf>-fired Power Plant, , Chalmers University of Technology Sweden; Allam, R., White, V., Ivens, N., Simmonds, M., The oxyfuel baseline: Revamping heaters and boilers to oxyfiring by cryogenic air separation and flue gas recycle (2005) Carbon Dioxide Capture for Storage in Deep Geologic Formations, , Thomas DC, editors Elsevier; Andersson, K., Birkestad, H., Maksinen, P., Johnsson, F., Mberg, L.S., Lyngfelt, A., An MW lignite fired CO<inf>2</inf> free power plant - A technical feasibility study.

In addition to the steelmaking processes, chemical processes such as pressure/temperature swing adsorption, membrane, chemical absorption technologies are included for gas treatment. A methanol plant integrated with a combined heat and power plant forms a polygeneration system that utilizes energy and gases of the site. The overall model has been applied using mathematical programming to find an optimal design and operation of the integrated plant for an economic objective under several development stages of the technology. New concepts studied are blast furnace operation with different degrees of top gas recycling and oxygen enrichment of the blast to full oxygen blast furnace. Coke in the process may be partially replaced with other carbon carriers. The system is optimized by maximizing the net present value, which includes investment costs for the new unit processes as well as costs of feed materials, CO2 emission and sequestration, operation costs and credit for products produced. The effect of using different fuels such as oil, natural gas, pulverized coal, coke oven gas, charcoal and biomass is studied, particularly focusing on biomass torrefaction and the effect of integration on arising reductant in steelmaking to reduce emissions from the system. The effects of steel plant capacity on the optimal choice of carbon carriers are also studied. It is demonstrated that it is possible to decrease the specific CO2 emissions of primary steelmaking from fossil fuels from 1.6t of CO2 to a level of 0.75-1.0t and further by more than 50% through the integration of biofuels in considered scenarios. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Blast furnace; Carbon dioxide emission; Reducing agents; Sustainable development; Torrefaction","Arens, M., Worrell, E., Diffusion of energy efficient technologies in the German steel industry and their impact on energy consumption (2014) Energy, 73, p. 968; Babich, A., Gudenau, H.W., Formoso, A., Mavrommatis, K.T., Froehling, C., Garcia, L., Choice of technological regimes of a blast furnace operation with injection of hot reducing gases (2002) Rev.

The presence of geochemical markers, such as n-alkanes, steranes, pentacyclic triterpenoids, and alkyl PAHs, their distribution types, and values of their ratios indicates the predominating source of organic fossil fuels and products of their refining rather than from the natural Antarctic environment. Fossil fuel-originated compounds well survived in conditions of Antarctic climate over long times thus enabling to characterize geochemical features of source fossil fuel identified as petroleum expelled from kerogen II of algal/bacterial origins deposited in sub-oxic conditions and being in the middle of catagenesis. Both microbial activity and water leaching play an important role in degradation of terrestrial oil spills in the Antarctica climate, and petroleum alteration occurs lowly over long periods of time.

Furthermore, we would like to know, what we can do to reduce the carbon dioxide emission further and where it is most sensible to take action in order to do this.When renewable energy is introduced to replace the use of fossil fuels, a significant reduction of the carbon dioxide emission is to be expected, but it is not necessarily the case. To assess the carbon dioxide emission it is necessary to obtain knowledge about all the processes which involve carbon. Emission of a significant amount of carbon dioxide is the result of a number of natural processes for instance decomposition processes of organic matter in nature, and nature is also by the photosynthesis taking up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Therefore, in order to find the resulting net emission of carbon dioxide and answer the above mentioned questions, the development of a carbon cycling model (CCM) for the area or region is needed. A total of 26 different carbon pools are considered in the CCM of Samsø, including the various agricultural products, three fractions of carbon in soil, forests, wetlands, grasslands, straw used for heating and the production in the industry (Trolleborg). The transfer processes among the various pools are quite well known from literature and estimates of the agricultural and industrial production on the island can be derived from available data. It is furthermore known how much forest, wetland and grassland, that Samsø has and how many inhabitants that live on the island, how much solid waste they produce and how much carbon dioxide they respire. The CCM has been developed based on this knowledge and has furthermore been adapted to follow the annual variations.Due to the use of renewable energy, it can be shown by the CCM that Samsø to day net removes 26. 460. t carbon per year in form of carbon dioxide (97. 020. t/year of carbon dioxide is removed), while no carbon dioxide was net removed in 1997, before introduction of renewable energy on the island. The model is applied as environmental management tool. If it is assumed that Samsø is fossil fuel free and 5000. t carbon is removed by the use of supplementary crops, as much as almost 40. 000. t of carbon as carbon dioxide will be removed from the atmosphere. This amount corresponds also to more than the difference between carbon exported and imported, which means that Samsø is even removing in this case the carbon that is emitted as carbon dioxide in the towns when the agricultural production from Samsø is utilized as food.A clear improvement of the carbon dioxide is therefore possible by the use of these two measures: make Samsø a fossil fuel island and use supplementary crops. These applications of the CCM show that the model can be used as a powerful management tool. It is the intention to use the CCM in the coming years to find the solutions for the development of the energy use on Samsø that will yield the biggest reduction of the emission of carbon dioxide and other green house gases. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","A powerful environmental management tool; Carbon balance; Carbon cycling model; Carbon dioxide emission","Jørgensen, S.E., Bendoricchio, G., (2001) Fundamentals of Ecological Modelling, p. 628. , Elsevier, Amsterdam; Jørgensen, S.E., Fath, B., (2011) Fundamentals of Ecological Modelling, p. 400. , Elsevier, Amsterdam; Jørgensen, L.A., Jørgensen, S.E., Nielsen, S.N., (2000) Ecotox.

The proposed methodology allows the estimation of the anthropogenic GHG emissions of thermochemical biorefineries (net emitted to the atmosphere). In the calculation of the GHG balance, all relevant factors have been identified and analyzed including multiproduction, emissions from biogenic carbon capture and storage (Bio-CCS), co-feeding of fossil fuels (secondary feedstock) and possible carbon storage in biomass-derived products (chemicals). Therefore, it is possible to calculate the balance of GHG emissions of a hypothetical thermochemical biorefinery considering different alternatives of land-use, biomass feedstock, co-feeding of fossil fuels, Bio-CCS incorporation and final use of the products. The comparison of the estimated GHG balance with the corresponding fossil reference for each product is of special relevance in the methodology since it is the parameter used in European regulation for the fulfillment of sustainability criteria in biomass-derived fuels and liquids. The proposed methodology is tested using a previously assessed set of different process concepts of thermochemical biorefineries (techno-economic analysis). The resulting GHG balance and saving are analyzed to identify uncertainties and provide recommendations for future regulation. In all process concepts, the GHG savings are above the minimum requirement of GHG emissions for 2018. In the case of incorporating Bio-CCS, cradle-to-grave negative GHG emissions are obtained. However, in order to assess the role of chemical co-production from biomass, they need to be included in future regulation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Balance of GHG emissions; Bio-CCS; Multiproduction; Saving of GHG emissions; Thermochemical biorefinery","Haro, P., Villanueva Perales, A.L., Arjona, R., Ollero, P., Thermochemical biorefineries with multiproduction using a platform chemical (2014) Biofuels, Bioprod Biorefin, 8 (2), pp. 155-170; http://www.enerkem.comhttp://www.biodme.eu/http://www.bioliq.de/english/index.phphttp://www.goteborgenergi.se/English/Projects/GoBiGas__Gothenburg_Biomass_Gasification_ProjectTrippe, F., Fröhling, M., Schultmann, F., Stahl, R., Henrich, E., Dalai, A., Comprehensive techno-economic assessment of dimethyl ether (DME) synthesis and fischer-tropsch synthesis as alternative process steps within biomass-to-liquid production (2013) Fuel Process Technol, 106, pp. 577-586; Centi, G., Lanzafame, P., Perathoner, S., Analysis of the alternative routes in the catalytic transformation of lignocellulosic materials (2011) Catal Today, 167 (1), pp. 14-30; Ragauskas, A.J., Williams, C.K., Davison, B.H., Britovsek, G., Cairney, J., Eckert, C.A., The path forward for biofuels and biomaterials (2006) Science, 311 (5760), pp. 484-489; Laser, M., Larson, E., Dale, B., Wang, M., Greene, N., Lynd, L.R., Comparative analysis of efficiency, environmental impact, and process economics for mature biomass refining scenarios (2009) Biofuels, Bioprod Biorefin, 3 (2), pp. 247-270; Haro, P., Ollero, P., Villanueva Perales, A.L., Gómez-Barea, A., Thermochemical biorefinery based on dimethyl ether as intermediate: technoeconomic assessment (2013) Appl Energy, 102, pp. 950-961; Reporting and Accounting for Negative Emissions under UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol (2011), http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/download/5k9h0wd6407k.pdf?expires=1384340056%26id=id%26accname=guest%26checksum=A46076BB6FC5798FF20693E01F08DAE8, Working Paper.

Among known systems, lithium-ion batteries are recognized as the most appropriate energy storage system because of their high energy density and thus space saving in applications. Introduction of nanotechnology to electrode material is beneficial to improve the resulting electrode performances such as capacity, its retention, and rate capability. The nanostructure is highly available not only when used alone but also is more highlighted when harmonized in forms of core-shell structure and composites with carbon nanotubes, graphene or reduced graphene oxides. This review covers syntheses and electrochemical properties of nanoscale, nanosized, and nanostructured cathode materials for rechargeable lithium batteries. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","anostructure; atteries; ithium; Nanoscale; Nanosize; thode","Yoshino, A., (2000) Mol.

This work reports, for the first time, the use of carbon-supported shape-controlled Pt nanoparticles as anode catalysts in direct ethanol fuel cells. By using cubic Pt nanoparticles, on which (100) surface sites are predominant, the performance of the fuel cell can be increased from 14 to 24 mW per mg of Pt when compared with cuboctahedral nanoparticles. Moreover, the open circuit potential shifts about 50 mV toward more positive potentials. In comparison with commercially available Pt catalysts, the performance for the (100) preferentially oriented nanoparticles is about three times higher. The reported results evidence that, from an applied point of view, the effect of the surface structure/shape of the electrocatalysts can be also considered to improve the performance of real fuel cell systems. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

During the last decade, metabolic engineering has been performed to develop superior microorganisms for the production of so called advanced biofuels. Among the advanced biofuels, hydrocarbons possess high-energy content and superior fuel properties to other biofuels, and thus have recently been attracting much research interest. Here we review the recent advances in the microbial production of hydrocarbon fuels together with the metabolic engineering strategies employed to develop their production strains. Strategies employed for the production of long-chain and short-chain hydrocarbons derived from fatty acid metabolism along with the isoprenoid-derived hydrocarbons are reviewed. Also, the current limitations and future prospects in hydrocarbon-based biofuel production are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Peralta-Yahya, P.P., Keasling, J.D., Advanced biofuel production in microbes (2010) Biotechnol J, 5, pp. 147-162; Peralta-Yahya, P.P., Zhang, F.Z., del Cardayre, S.B., Keasling, J.D., Microbial engineering for the production of advanced biofuels (2012) Nature, 488, pp. 320-328; Harvey, B.G., Meylemans, H.A., The role of butanol in the development of sustainable fuel technologies (2011) J Chem Technol Biotechnol, 86, pp. 2-9; Connor, M.R., Cann, A.F., Liao, J.C., 3-Methyl-1-butanol production in Escherichia coli: random mutagenesis and two-phase fermentation (2010) Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, 86, pp. 1155-1164; Zheng, Y., Liu, Q., Li, L., Qin, W., Yang, J., Zhang, H., Jiang, X., Xu, X., Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for high-specificity production of isoprenol and prenol as next generation of biofuels (2013) Biotechnol Biofuels; Zhang, F., Rodriguez, S., Keasling, J.D., Metabolic engineering of microbial pathways for advanced biofuels production (2011) Curr Opin Biotechnol, 22, pp. 775-783; Petrus, L., Noordermeer, M.A., Biomass to biofuels, a chemical perspective (2006) Green Chem, 8, pp. 861-867; Lennen, R.M., Braden, D.J., West, R.M., Dumesic, J.A., Pfleger, B.F., A process for microbial hydrocarbon synthesis: overproduction of fatty acids in Escherichia coli and catalytic conversion to alkanes (2010) Biotechnol Bioeng, 106, pp. 193-202; Schirmer, A., Rude, M.A., Li, X., Popova, E., del Cardayre, S.B., Microbial biosynthesis of alkanes (2010) Science, 329, pp. 559-562; Harger, M., Zheng, L., Moon, A., Ager, C., An, J.H., Choe, C., Lai, Y.-L., Smith, M.D., Expanding the product profile of a microbial alkane biosynthetic pathway (2013) ACS Synth Biol, 2, pp. 59-62; Choi, Y.J., Lee, S.Y., Microbial production of short-chain alkanes (2013) Nature, 502, pp. 571-574; Ahmad, A.L., Yasin, N.H.M., Derek, C.J.C., Lim, J.K., Microalgae as a sustainable energy source for biodiesel production: a review (2011) Renew Sust Energy Rev, 15, pp. 584-593; Adewale, P., Dumont, M.-J., Ngadi, M., Rheological, thermal, and physicochemical characterization of animal fat wastes for use in biodiesel production (2014) Energy Technol, 2, pp. 634-642; Rincon, L.E., Jaramillo, J.J., Cardona, C.A., Comparison of feedstocks and technologies for biodiesel production: an environmental and techno-economic evaluation (2014) Renew Energy, 69, pp. 479-487; Chisti, Y., Biodiesel from microalgae (2007) Biotechnol Adv, 25, pp. 294-306; Schenk, P.M., Thomas-Hall, S.R., Stephens, E., Marx, U.C., Mussgnug, J.H., Posten, C., Kruse, O., Hankamer, B., Second generation biofuels: high-efficiency microalgae for biodiesel production (2008) Bioenergy Res, 1, pp. 20-43; Delanoue, J., Laliberte, G., Proulx, D., Algae and waste-water (1992) J Appl Phycol, 4, pp. 247-254; Yoo, C., Jun, S.-Y., Lee, J.-Y., Ahn, C.-Y., Oh, H.-M., Selection of microalgae for lipid production under high levels carbon dioxide (2010) Bioresour Technol; Griffiths, M.J., Harrison, S.T.L., Lipid productivity as a key characteristic for choosing algal species for biodiesel production (2009) J Appl Phycol, 21, pp. 493-507; Zhu, L., Hiltunen, E., Shu, Q., Zhou, W., Li, Z., Wang, Z., Biodiesel production from algae cultivated in winter with artificial wastewater through pH regulation by acetic acid (2014) Appl Energy, 128, pp. 103-110; Lv, J.M., Cheng, L.H., Xu, X.H., Zhang, L., Chen, H.L., Enhanced lipid production of Chlorella vulgaris by adjustment of cultivation conditions (2010) Bioresour Technol, 101, pp. 6797-6804; Liang, K., Zhang, Q., Gu, M., Cong, W., Effect of phosphorus on lipid accumulation in freshwater microalga Chlorella sp.

This paper sets out the numerical methods and evidence of real-world performance needed to compare fuel cells with other low-carbon technologies. It is demonstrated that firstly, the efficiency of present-day fuel cells is high enough to outperform the best electric heat pumps, even when these are powered exclusively by the best modern power stations. The equivalent COP (coefficient of performance) of today's fuel cells ranges from 5 to ∞, compared to 3-4 for the best ground source heat pumps. Secondly, this high efficiency means that even when fuelled with natural gas, the heat from a fuel cell is zero- or even negative-carbon when electricity from central power stations is displaced. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Buildings; Carbon emissions; CHP; Fuel cells; Heat; Heat pumps","The Future of Heating: Meeting the challenge: (2013) Department of Energy and Climate Change., , http://tinyurl.com/decc-future-heat; Energy Technology Perspectives (2014), Paris: OECD/IEAMacKay, D.J.C., Sustainable Energy - without the hot air.

In the last several years, new technologies have been developed, and some of them received subsidies to increase installation and reduce cost. This article presents an innovative cogeneration system based on a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system and heat pump for household applications with a focus on primary energy and economic savings using electric equivalent load parameter which is a function of the electricity and heat demand of the user, and allows different operation strategies to be considered. The proposal is to maximize the efficiency of the system and to make it profitable, even though technologies with a high purchase cost are considered. Simulations of the system are performed under different strategies at a resort located in a northern European climate (Denmark) to cover electricity, space heating and domestic hot water (DHW) demands. The results of these simulations are analyzed with thermodynamic and techno-economic benchmarks, considering different economic scenarios. The calculations show the high primary energy saving and profitability of the system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Heat pump; Hybrid system; Operating strategy; SOFC","Sanchez, D., Chacartegui, R., Torres, M., Sanchez, T., Stirling based fuel cell hybrid systems: an alternative for molten carbonate fuel cells (2008) Power Sources, 192, pp. 84-93;

Considering that agricultural vehicles that use fossil fuels emit significant amounts of atmospheric pollutants, the main objective of this paper is to include techniques to reduce the fuel consumption in the controls system of robotic tractors used in agriculture tasks and thereby reduce the atmospheric emissions from these automated applications. To achieve this goal, the first step is to analyze fuel consumption in real time for each of the applications to be improved and to implement the consumption model of a robotic tractor for each task, considering the mechanical energy variations, the performance losses, the energy used to overcome friction and the energy required by the given task. For calculating the mechanical energy, the model considers the potential energy of the system, which is a function of the mass, elevation and gravity. The terrain elevations are estimated from GeoTIFF images of DEM data, which have a pixel size equal to 1. arc second (approximately 30. m at the Equator), and an accuracy of integer meters. Regarding the system mass, the possible loss of mass from applying the treatment is considered. For estimating the frictional forces, the rolling resistance coefficient of the terrain surface conditions is used.The consumption model has been validated experimentally using real agricultural vehicles and implements within the RHEA project (FP7-NMP 245986), in which the instantaneous fuel consumption was measured.This fuel reduction method is applied to three different treatments: weed control on herbaceous crops through the spraying of herbicides, weed control on fire-resistant crops with wide furrows through plowing and flame treatment, and pest control on trees through fumigation using insecticides.Finally, a fuel reduction procedure is applied to each task using the system model implemented to predict the energy requirements. This enables one to find the optimum path plan with respect to fuel consumption. These theoretical results are compared with the experimental results. In addition, the goal is to demonstrate the fuel reduction technique by performing field experiments to show that the use of this method of fuel reduction leads to an reduced fuel consumption and thus reduces atmospheric emissions from agricultural tasks. The results obtained revealed that this fuel reduction method significantly reduces the energy requirements, with the consequent reduction in fuel consumption and atmospheric pollutant emissions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric emissions; Digital elevation model (DEM); Energy efficiency; Path planning; Reducing fuel consumption","4 DEC95 Agricultural Machinery Management Data (1995) ASAE Standards.

To realize this technology on an industrial scale, the development of high-fidelity simulations is a necessary step to develop a thorough understanding of the CLC process. In this paper, simulations for multiphase flow of the CD-CLC process with chemical reactions are performed using ANSYS FLUENT computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The details of the solid-gas two-phase hydrodynamics in the CLC process are investigated using the Lagrangian particletracking approach called the discrete element method (DEM) for the movement and interaction of the solid oxygen carrier particles with the gaseous fuel. The initial CFD/DEM simulation shows excellent agreement with the experimental results obtained in a laboratory scale fuel reactor in cold-flow conditions at Darmstadt University of Technology. Subsequent simulations using 60% Fe2O3 supported on MgAl2O4 reacting with gaseous CH4 demonstrate successful integration of chemical reactions into the CFCD/DEM approach. This work provides a strong foundation for future simulations of CD-CLC systems using solid coal as fuel, which will be crucial for successful deployment of CD-CLC technology from the laboratory scale to pilot and industrial scale projects. © 2015 by ASME.",,"Arrhenius, S., On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air Upon the Temperature of the Ground (1896) Philos.

In order to relieve those problems, new energy vehicles are introduced into the bus and car market. We adopt life cycle analysis to evaluate the well-to-wheels (WTW) energy consumption, CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and pollutant emissions from the traditional diesel bus and new energy buses, including diesel hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), compressed natural gas vehicles (CNGVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). This study reports the current situation and projects future scenarios for the BEV bus for several regions in China due to significant regional differences in the power generation mix. Compared to the diesel bus, the HEV bus can reduce petroleum, fossil fuel use and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions by about 20%, and, at the same time, produce stable reduction benefits for all air pollutants. The CNG bus achieves reductions of WTW primary PM<inf>2.5</inf> emissions by 70% over its diesel counterpart and, of course, uses little petroleum; but increases fossil fuel consumption moderately and has no benefit in GHG emissions. The BEV bus can deliver a substantial petroleum consumption advantage and greatly reduce the WTW NO<inf>X</inf>, VOC and CO emissions; but, if the electricity is generated from burning coal, the BEV bus has no PM<inf>2.5</inf> emission benefit compared to the conventional diesel bus. Currently, the BEV bus increases fossil energy use and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions in the coal-dominated regions; but, in the future, it can achieve substantially lower fossil energy use and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions with more penetration of clean electric energy. To reach the win-win strategy, a city's initial reliance on diesel buses for the public fleet has to give way to a mixture of these new energy buses; and the fleet mix should be diversified over the region and modified over time to accommodate changes in these energy and environmental parameters. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Air pollution; CNG bus; CO<inf>2</inf>; Electric bus; Energy security; Life cycle analysis","(2013) BP statistical review of world energy., , London; (2012) China analysis brief., , Washington; Wang, Y.S., Teter, J., Sperling, D., China's soaring vehicle population: even greater than forecasted (2011) Energy Policy, 39, pp. 3296-3306; Wu, Y., Yang, Z.D., Lin, B.H., Liu, H., Wang, R.J., Zhou, B.Y., Energy consumption and CO<inf>2</inf> emission impacts of vehicle electrification in three developed regions of China (2012) Energy Policy, 48, pp. 537-550; Richter, A., Burrows, J.P., Nüß, H., Granier, C., Niemeier, U., Increase in tropospheric nitrogen dioxide over China observed from space (2005) Nature, 437, pp. 129-132; Haze Over Eastern China., , http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/imageo/2013/02/20/haze-over-eastern-china/#, Uf77WOktEl6; Smog and sandstorm engulf China's capital., , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-21612150; Beijing adopts emergency measures for 'hazardous' pollution., , http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/14/world/asia/china-smog-blanket; Wang, S., Zhao, M., Xing, J., Wu, Y., Zhou, Y., Lei, Y., Quantifying the air pollutants emission reduction during the 2008 olympic games in Beijing (2010) Environ Sci Technol, 44 (7), pp. 2490-2496; Du, X., Wu, Y., Fu, L.X., Wang, S.X., Zhang, S.J., Hao, J.M., Intake fraction of PM<inf>2.5</inf> and NOx from vehicle emissions in Beijing based on personal exposure data (2012) Atmos Environ, 57, pp. 233-243; (2012) Public health round-up., , Geneva; (2012) C.A.o.A., 5,579 electric cars sold in China in 2011., , Wind energy and electric vehicle review; Crowne, P., (2012) China to sell over 4 million electrified vehicles in 2020., , http://www.hybridcars.com/china-set-sell-over-4-million-evs-2020-62718/; Yeh, S., An empirical analysis on the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles: the case of natural gas vehicles (2007) Energy Policy, 35, pp. 5865-5875; Zhang, S.J., Wu, Y., Wu, X.M., Li, M.L., Ge, Y.S., Liang, B., Historic and future trends of vehicle emissions in Beijing, 1998-2020: a policy assessment for the most stringent vehicle emission control program in China (2014) Atmos Environ, 89, pp. 216-229; (2012) The 12th five year plan for transportation development in Beijing, , [in Chinese]; Huo, H., Wu, Y., Wang, M., Total versus urban: well-to-wheels assessment of criteria pollutant emissions from various vehicle/fuel systems (2009) Atmos Environ, 43, pp. 1796-1804; Burnham, A., Han, J., Clark, C.E., Wang, M., Dunn, J.B., Palou-Rivera, I., Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of shale gas, natural gas, coal and petroleum (2012) Environ Sci Technol, 46, pp. 619-627; Dunn, J.B., Gaines, L., Sullivan, J., Wang, M.Q., Impact of recycling on cradle-to-gate energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of automotive lithium-ion batteries (2012) Environ Sci Technol, 46, pp. 12704-12710; Arteconi, A., Brandoni, C., Evangelista, D., Polonara, F., Life-cycle greenhouse gas analysis of LNG as a heavy vehicle fuel in Europe (2010) Appl Energy, 87, pp. 2005-2013; Ribau, J.P., Silva, C.M., Sousa, J.M.C., Efficiency, cost and life cycle CO<inf>2</inf> optimization of fuel cell hybrid and plug-in hybrid urban buses (2014) Appl Energy, 129, pp. 320-335; Hu, X.S., Murgovski, N., Johannesson, L., Egardt, B., Energy efficiency analysis of a series plug-in hybrid electric bus with different energy management strategies and battery sizes (2013) Appl Energy, 111, pp. 1001-1009; Hu, X.S., Murgovski, N., Johannesson, L.M., Egardt, B., Comparison of three electrochemical energy buffers applied to a hybrid bus powertrain with simultaneous optimal sizing and energy management (2014) IEEE Trans Intell Transport Syst, 15, pp. 1193-1205; Sciarretta, A., Guzzella, L., Control of hybrid electric vehicles (2007) IEEE Control Syst Mag, 27, pp. 60-70; Ligterink, N., Patuleia, A., Koornneef, G., (2013) Current state and emission performance of CNG/LNG heavy-duty vehicles., , TNO report TNO 2013 R10148; Zhang, S.J., Wu, Y., Liu, H., Huang, R.K., Yang, L., Li, Z.H., Real-world fuel consumption and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions of urban public buses in Beijing (2014) Appl Energy, 113, pp. 1645-1655; Zhang, S.J., Wu, Y., Hu, J.N., Huang, R.K., Zhou, Y., Bao, X.F., Can Euro V heavy-duty diesel engines and alternative fuel technologies mitigate NOx emissions?

With over 50 new nuclear power plants under construction or planned and a design life of 60 years, any discussions on structural integrity become very timely. Although China adopted its nuclear technology from France or USA at present time, e.g., AP1000 of Westinghouse, the construction materials are primarily ""Made in China."" Among all issues, both the accumulation of the knowledge base of the materials and structures used for the power plant and the technical capability of engineering personnel are imminent. This paper attempts to compile and assess the mechanical properties, Charpy V-notch impact energy, and fracture toughness of A508-3 steel used in Chinese nuclear reactor pressure vessels (RPVs). All data are collected from open literature and by no means complete. However, it provides a glimpse into how this domestically produced steel compares with western RPV steels such as USA A533B and Euro 20MnMoNi55.

Market-based policies, in particular, often use information about carbon intensity to adjust relative deployment incentives for different energy sources. However, the carbon intensity of bioenergy is difficult to quantify because carbon emissions can occur when land use changes to expand production of bioenergy crops rather than simply when the fuel is consumed as for fossil fuels. Using a long-term, integrated assessment model, this paper develops an approach for computing the carbon intensity of bioenergy production that isolates the marginal impact of increasing production of a specific bioenergy crop in a specific region, taking into account economic competition among land uses. We explore several factors that affect emission intensity and explain these results in the context of previous studies that use different approaches. Among the factors explored, our results suggest that the carbon intensity of bioenergy production from land use change (LUC) differs by a factor of two depending on the region in which the bioenergy crop is grown in the United States. Assumptions about international land use policies (such as those related to forest protection) and crop yields also significantly impact carbon intensity. Finally, we develop and demonstrate a generalized method for considering the varying time profile of LUC emissions from bioenergy production, taking into account the time path of future carbon prices, the discount rate and the time horizon. When evaluated in the context of power sector applications, we found electricity from bioenergy crops to be less carbon-intensive than conventional coal-fired electricity generation and often less carbon-intensive than natural-gas fired generation. © 2015.","Bioenergy crops; Carbon intensity; Integrated assessment modeling; Land use change","Beach, R., McCarl, B., U.S. Agricultural and Forestry Impacts of the Energy Independence and Security Act: FASOM results and model description (2010) RTI International, , http://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/962ffb6750050099852577820072dfde/$file/fasom+report_eisa_fr.pdf, (January 2010.); Calvin, K., Clarke, L., Edmonds, J., Eom, J., Hejazi, M., Kim, S., Kyle, G., Wise, M., GCAM Wiki Documentation, , https://wiki.umd.edu/gcam/; California Air Resources Board (2009) Proposed Regulation to Implement the Low Carbon Fuel Standard: Volume 1.

In this regard, the use of marginal soils such as abandoned farmland and non-conventional water resources, including recycled urban wastewater (RWW), is posited as a viable and sustainable system for growing such crops. The present study evaluates the sustainability of Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) irrigated with RWW in abandoned farming soils on the island of Fuerteventura (Canary Islands, Spain), which is one of the most arid parts of the European Union. The evaluation of the crop was carried out during its first 48 months and compared the effects of two irrigation systems - surface drip irrigation (SDI) and subsurface drip irrigation (SSDI) - and two irrigation doses - 75% of ETp (dose A) and 100% de ETp (dose B) - on the growth, productivity and nutritional status of JCL, as well as on the soil quality. The results indicate that SSDI does not offer significant advantages compared to SDI in terms of nutritional status, growth or productivity. However, the amount of water used for irrigation does significantly influence JCL growth (199 vs. 220cm plant height for doses A and B, respectively) but not productivity (815 vs. 1000kg seedha-1 for doses A and B, respectively). Irrespective of the irrigation system and dose applied, RWW irrigation led to a significant increase in soil salinity. For example, in topsoil (0-20cm), average values of 42.0dSm-1 and 6.8mgL-1 of electrical conductivity and soluble boron were reached, respectively. The sustainability of the system under experimental conditions is discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Biofuel; Jatropha curcas L.; Marginal land; Renewable energy crop; Seed yield; Wastewater reuse","Abou Kheira, A.A., Atta, N.M.M., Response of Jatropha curcas L. to water deficits: yield, water use efficiency and oilseed characteristics (2009) Biomass Bioenergy, 33, pp. 1343-1350; Abu-Awwad, A.M., Influence of different water quantities and qualities on lemon trees and soil salts distribution at the Jordan Valley (2001) Agric.

The study was part of an initiative to substitute fossil derived gaseous fuels with syngas. The fuel injector and spark plug were periodically inspected during the shutdown and the preliminary inspection indicated traces of deposits. As a result, the cylinder head was dismantled and inspected thoroughly after the run. The surface morphology was characterized by FESEM and its elemental contents were evaluated by EDX. Among the components, the spark plug was found to be best suitable for scanning in FESEM and EDX. Tests were conducted on the sides with and without deposit of the spark plug. The results from both sides were compared. No feed marks were formed even at higher magnification at the clean side. However, the side with deposit of the spark plug shows a spongy texture foreign material. Besides, the colour and morphology was different at different locations. Chemical composition was evaluated on atomic and weight percentage. The deposit was found to be iron oxide produced from the decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl contaminant from the storage tank as the result of carbon monoxide reaction with metallic wall of the tank at high pressure storage. © 2015, The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Syngas direct-injection spark-ignition combustion deposits","Abdullah, M.A., Aziz, A.R.A., An experimental investigation of hydrogen combustion in a direct injection spark ignition natural gas engine (2009) SAE Paper No.; Anon, Wood gas as engine fuel (1986) FAO Forestry Paper, 72, p. 133; Basu, P., (2010) Biomass Gasification and Pyrolysis: Practical Design and Theory; Decker, K.D., Wood Gas Vehicles: Firewood in the Fuel Tank [Online] (2010) Barcelona, Spain, , http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2010/01/wood-gas-cars.html; Firmansyah, (2007) Optimization of Injection Parameters in Compressed Natural Gas Direct Injection Spark Ignition Engine; Hagos, F.Y., (2013) Combustion, Performance and Emissions Characteristics of Imitated Syngases in Directinjection Spark-igntion Engine; Hagos, F.Y., Aziz, A.R.A., Mass fraction burn investigation of lean burn low BTU gasification gas in direct-injection spark-ignition engine (2014) SAE Paper No.; Hagos, F.Y., Aziz, A.R.A., Sulaiman, S.A., Combustion characteristics of direct-injection sparkignition engine fuelled with producer gas (2013) Energy Education Science and Technology Part A: Energy Science and Research, 31, p. 3; Hagos, F.Y., Aziz, A.R.A., Sulaiman, S.A., Syngas (H2/CO) in a spark-ignition direct-injection engine.

Jatropha curcas oil has been well researched as non-edible vegetable oil for the production of biodiesel using conventional processes which generate huge obnoxious wastes and consequently incur additional cost for treatment and disposal of the generated waste. This paper presents the hydrolytic biosynthesis of J. curcas hydrolysate (FFA) for the production of biodiesel using locally produced Candida cylindracea lipase immobilized on functionalized activated carbon support. Up to 78% of free fatty acid (FFA) was achieved through hydrolytic reaction relative to the source and activity of the enzyme employed. Optimum dose of the catalyst loading was 8% (w/w) of the immobilized matrix at 40 °C reaction temperature and 200 rpm agitation. All reactions were allowed to proceed for 24 h, and catalyst could be recycled four times for optimal FFA yield. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Candida cylindrecea lipase; Hydrolysate; Hydrolysis; Jatropha curcas","Fukuda, H., Kondo, A., Noda, H., (2001) J.

Diesel fuel costs represent a significant portion of the utilities' expenditure. Solar photovoltaic (PV) integration is an attractive solution reduces fossil fuel dependency for such communities. This study presents an off-grid hybrid PV/diesel model developed using dynamic modelling and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques. Dynamic subsystem models were developed in Simulink and ANN methods were employed for predictive modelling. Utilizing simple climate data (humidity, rain fall, ambient temperature and wind speed) and load profile as model inputs, generator and PV output powers and fuel consumption can be accurately predicted. Experimental data were used for ANN training and model validation. A comparative analysis was conducted between the Simulink model and an existing industrial design tool for a remote community in the Northern Australia. Simulation results showed that the developed model is a viable planning and analytical tool for aiding future off-grid PV-to-diesel system integration applications, with R2 values ranging from 0.92 to 0.99 and mean relative errors below 5%. Lastly, the incorporation of both dynamic and ANN modelling techniques in a single model reduces modelling complexity whilst maintaining its accuracy and ease-of-use. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Artificial neural network;

Several researchers are promoting novel ideas and cutting edge technology which would eventually lead to leap fogging innovation and breakthrough in the area of alternative fuels. In this, concern hydrogen is increasing in demand because of its wide flammability limits, minimum ignition energy, high calorific value and high flame velocity. Apart from that it does not demand much modifications in the mechanism of the normal diesel engine to run as dual fuel and also it does not contain any carbon atom which eliminate emissions of CO<inf>2</inf>, unburnt and partially burnt hydrocarbons such as aldehydes and other greenhouse gases concerned with combustion. In the present experimental investigation 10% and 20% of hydrogen by mass of fuel is inducted into the combustion chamber in conjunction with air in hydrogen-diesel dual fuel mode. The variation in injection operating pressure is done to optimize the performance characteristics and emissions. Experimentations were conducted on three different injection operating pressures (IOP) i.e. 200, 220 and 240 bar at full load condition and the performance characteristics were calculated. The effect of IOP on emissions were measured and reported. The rate of heat release and pressure release were also measured. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to make solar energy a viable alternative to fossil fuels, the problem of intermittency must be solved. Batteries and supercapacitors are an area of active research, but they currently have relatively low energy-to-mass storage capacity. An alternative and very promising possibility is to store energy in chemical bonds, or make a solar fuel.The process of making solar fuel is not new, since photosynthesis has been occurring on earth for about 3 billion years. In order to produce any fuel, protons and electrons must be harvested from a species in its oxidized form. Photosynthesis uses the only viable source of electrons and protons on the scale needed for global energy demands: water. Because artificial photosynthesis is a lofty goal, water oxidation, which is a crucial step in the process, has been the initial focus.This Account provides an overview of how terahertz spectroscopy is used to study electron injection, highlights trends from previously published reports, and concludes with a future outlook. It begins by exploring similarities and differences between dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) for producing electricity and a putative device for splitting water and producing a solar fuel. It then identifies two important problems encountered when adapting DSSC technology to water oxidation-improper energy matching between sensitizer energy levels with the potential for water oxidation and the instability of common anchoring groups in water-and discusses steps to address them. Emphasis is placed on electron injection from sensitizers to metal oxides because this process is the initial step in charge transport. Both the rate and efficiency of electron injection are analyzed on a sub-picosecond time scale using time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy (TRTS).Bio-inspired pentafluorophenyl porphyrins are promising sensitizers because their high reduction potentials are compatible with the energy requirements of water oxidation. TRTS of free-base and metalated pentafluorophenyl porphyrins reveal inefficient electron injection into TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles but more efficient electron injection into SnO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles. With SnO<inf>2</inf>, injection time scales depend strongly on the identity of the central substituent and are affected by competition with excited-state deactivation processes. Heavy or paramagnetic metal ions increase the electron injection time scale by roughly one order of magnitude relative to free-base or Zn2+ porphyrins due to the possibility of electron injection from longer-lived, lower-lying triplet states. Furthermore, electron injection efficiency loosely correlates with DSSC performance.The carboxylate anchoring group is commonly used to bind DSSC sensitizers to metal oxide surfaces but typically is not stable under the aqueous and oxidative conditions required for water oxidation. Electron injection efficiency of several water-stable alternatives, including phosphonic acid, hydroxamic acid, acetylacetone, and boronic acid, were evaluated using TRTS, and hydroxamate was found to perform as well as the carboxylate.The next challenge is incorporating a water oxidation catalyst into the design. An early example, in which an Ir-based precatalyst is cosensitized with a fluorinated porphyrin, reveals decreased electron injection efficiency despite an increase in photocurrent. Future research will seek to better understand and address these difficulties. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Oregan, B., Grätzel, M., A Low-Cost, High-Efficiency Solar-Cell Based on Dye-Sensitized Colloidal TiO<inf>2</inf> Films (1991) Nature, 353, pp. 737-740; Hagfeldt, A., Boschloo, G., Sun, L.C., Kloo, L., Pettersson, H., Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (2010) Chem.

Because of the fossil sources are not keeping pace with the spiraling consumption, the over exploitation of nature resource results more environmental deterioration, which is not only in developing countries, but in some of the developed countries. Biomass, with its economic and environmentally-friendly properties, has been widely employed in biorefineries to recuperate from the scarcity of fossil fuels. Moreover, with the development of technology, recent research has upgraded the acceleration of biomass utilization. To date, the fourth generation of biomass, organic waste, has been widely applied, and multiple target products of biomass conversion are available. The present review article aims to highlight the various biochemical processes for the conversion of organic wastes into valuable products. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In-depth spectroscopic and microscopic analyses of these adsorbents were performed to gain insights into their structural, morphological and textural characteristics. The microporous carbons have a remarkable CO2 uptake capacity (3.71 mmol g-1) at 25°C and at a pressure of 1 atm. These materials also feature good selectivity for CO2 over N2 gas and are composed of a hydrophobic core making them favorable as adsorbents for CO2 capture. The Freundlich equilibrium model well correlated with the experimental data obtained from the adsorption isotherms and classical micropore diffusion model described the adsorption kinetics satisfactorily. The Henry's law constant calculated using Virial model indicates the presence of strong electrostatic interactions and dispersion forces between CO2 and porous carbons. Furthermore, these carbon-based adsorbents can be used repeatedly up to 10 times for CO2 adsorption without significant loss of adsorption capacity. Overall, the results suggest that prepared microporous adsorbents provide a feasible option for capturing CO2 from post-fossil fuel combustion processes due to their potentially low costs, environmentally benign nature, and elevated CO2 capture capacity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we demonstrate the potential for a large-scale expansion of global nuclear power to replace fossil-fuel electricity production, based on empirical data from the Swedish and French light water reactor programs of the 1960s to 1990s. Analysis of these historical deployments show that if the world built nuclear power at no more than the per capita rate of these exemplar nations during their national expansion, then coal- and gas-fired electricity could be replaced worldwide in less than a decade. Under more conservative projections that take into account probable constraints and uncertainties such as differing relative economic output across regions, current and past unit construction time and costs, future electricity demand growth forecasts and the retiring of existing aging nuclear plants, our modelling estimates that the global share of fossil-fuel-derived electricity could be replaced within 25-34 years. This would allow the world to meet the most stringent greenhouse-gas mitigation targets. © 2015 Qvist, Brook.",,"Hansen, J., Assessing ""Dangerous Climate Change"": Required Reduction of Carbon Emissions to Protect Young People, Future Generations and Nature (2013) PLoS ONE, 8 (12); (2014) Status of Ratification of the Convention.

First, fossil fuel burning is increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) concentrations and, in turn, global warming. Second, fossil fuel resources are limited and will thus decrease in the long run. As a potential solution, there is a need for ecological manufacturing processes that convert raw plant materials into chemical products. For instance, raw plants can be directly converted into hydroxymethylfurfural, which is a versatile intermediate for the synthesis of valuable biofuels such as dimethylfuran and 5-ethoxymethyl-2-furfural. This technology has two benefits for chemical sustainability. First, the pretreatment step is eliminated, thus contributing to reduction of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Second, plants are sustainable resources versus fossil fuels, which are limited. Here, we review current sustainable technologies for the production of biobased products and hydroxymethylfurfural from plants, using in particular ionic liquids. Plant sources include poplar, switchgrass, miscanthus, weed plants, and agave species. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland","Biobased chemicals; Bioenergy; Biomass recalcitrance; Hydroxymethylfurfural; Ionic liquid; Plant bioengineering technology; Raw plant feedstock",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929120490

Can this growth be sustained through challenges of economic crisis, the complications of achieving higher penetration of variable renewables, and high socioeconomic costs of slowly winding down fossil fuel sector? This paper will argue that the clean technologies are now technically and economically viable with much lower level of support and that new financial mechanisms built on grid parity and hourly markets will enable the continuation of the transition process. Policies should now be directed towards decreasing fossil fuel subsidies and other barriers to renewables. Also, the technologies needed to enable the increase of penetration of variable renewables, such as flexible combined and Rankine cycle power plants, and smart energy systems based on demand side management, including through the integration of power, heat, water, and transport systems, are now at various levels of readiness. The integration will slowly enable the transition from a power system in which supply is following demand to a power system in which demand is following variable supply. The main issue will be the growing opposition from fossil fuels sectors, which are starting to be hurt by the new technologies. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Energy transition; Integration of energy systems; Renewable energy; Smart energy systems; Transport system; Water supply system",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929096263

This paper discusses options for increasing the resilience of food supplies to these risks. In contrast to local catastrophes, global food supply catastrophes cannot be addressed via food aid from external locations. Three options for food supply resilience are identified: food stockpiles, agriculture, and foods produced from alternative (non-sunlight) energy sources including biomass and fossil fuels. Each of these three options has certain advantages and disadvantages. Stockpiles are versatile but expensive. Agriculture is efficient but less viable in certain catastrophe scenarios. Alternative foods are inexpensive pre-catastrophe but need to be scaled up post-catastrophe and may face issues of social acceptability. The optimal portfolio of food options will typically include some of each and will additionally vary by location as regions vary in population and access to food input resources. Furthermore, if the catastrophe shuts down transportation, then resilience requires local self-sufficiency in food. Food supply resilience requires not just the food itself, but also the accompanying systems of food production and distribution. Overall, increasing food supply resilience can play an important role in global catastrophic risk reduction. However, it is unwise to attempt maximizing food supply resilience, because doing so comes at the expense of other important objectives, including catastrophe prevention. Taking all these issues into account, the paper proposes a research agenda for analysis of specific food supply resilience decisions. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York","Alternative foods; Food security; Global catastrophic risk; Nuclear winter; Resilience; Volcanic winter",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929120439

The goal is to accelerate research, development, and demonstration of safe, scalable, and affordable low-emissions energy technologies. Such a commitment should be based on three elements. First, it should operate within existing UNFCCC negotiations so as to encourage developed states to offer directed funding for energy research as part of their national contributions. Second, pledges should be binding, verifiable, and coordinated within an international energy-research plan. Third, expert scientific networks and participating governments should collaborate to design a coordinated global research and technology-demonstration strategy and oversee national research efforts. To this end an Intergovernmental Panel on Low-Emissions Technology Research might be established. This proposal offers some insurance against the risk that the political impasse in international negotiations cannot be overcome. The higher costs associated with low-emissions alternatives to fossil fuels currently creates significant economic and political resistance to their widespread adoption. To breach this impasse, a mechanism supporting accelerated energy research is needed that seeks to reduce future abatement costs, share experience and ‘learning-by-doing’ in first-of-a-kind demonstrations, and thus facilitate future widespread deployments. These actions will also assist in addressing inequalities in energy access. Policy relevance Over the past decade, global fossil-fuel use and associated carbon emissions have risen steadily, despite the majority of nations agreeing, in principle, to work to limit global warming to less than 2 °C above pre-industrial conditions (IPCC, 2014). Accelerated research, development, and demonstration of low-emissions technologies will be required for successful and economically efficient decarbonization of the global economy, but how can the current deadlock be broken? The UNFCCC does not contain adequate mechanisms to promote increased investment in research, so climate-governance institutions are not capturing the gains that could be achieved through a globally coordinated approach. Here, we outline reform proposals that would enhance both the economic effectiveness of global abatement efforts and the political feasibility of accelerated innovation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","induced technological change; innovation policy; multilateral climate policy frameworks; research policy",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929252758

Emissions from the combustion of gasoline and diesel fuels are the largest contributors to atmospheric BTEX concentrations. However, levels indoors (where people spend greater than 83% of their time) can be many times greater than outdoors. In this review we identified epidemiological studies assessing the noncancer health impacts of ambient level BTEX exposure (i.e., nonoccupational) and discussed how the health conditions may be hormonally mediated. Health effects significantly associated with ambient level exposure included sperm abnormalities, reduced fetal growth, cardiovascular disease, respiratory dysfunction, asthma, sensitization to common antigens, and more. Several hormones including estrogens, androgens, glucocorticoids, insulin, and serotonin may be involved in these health outcomes. This analysis suggests that all four chemicals may have endocrine disrupting properties at exposure levels below reference concentrations (i.e., safe levels) issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. These data should be considered when evaluating the use of BTEX in consumer and industrial products and indicates a need to change how chemicals present at low concentrations are assessed and regulated. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Sack, T.M., Steele, D.H., Hammerstrom, K., Remmers, J., A survey of household products for volatile organic compounds (1992) Atmos.

This is a consequence of rapid weathering of calcium silicate and hydroxide minerals derived from the demolition of concrete structures, which releases Ca that combines with CO<inf>2</inf> ultimately derived from the atmosphere, precipitating as calcite. Stable isotope data confirm an atmospheric origin for carbonate carbon, and 14C dating indicates the predominance of modern carbon in the pedogenic calcite. Trial pits show that carbonation extends to depths of ≥1 m. Work at other sites shows that the occurrence of pedogenic carbonates is widespread in artificially created urban soils containing Ca and Mg silicate minerals. Appropriate management of fewer than 12000 ha of urban land to maximize calcite precipitation has the potential to remove 1 million t of CO<inf>2</inf> from the atmosphere annually. The maximal global potential is estimated to be approximately 700-1200 Mt of CO<inf>2</inf> per year (representing 2.0-3.7% of total emissions from fossil fuel combustion) based on current rates of production of industry-derived Ca- and Mg-bearing materials. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Pacala, S., Socolow, R., Stabilization wedges: Solving the climate problem for the next 50 years with current technologies (2004) Science, 305 (5686), pp. 968-972; Davis, S.J., Cao, L., Caldeira, K., Hoffert, M.I., Rethinking wedges (2013) Environ.

The aim was to quantitatively determine the risk to reduced CFB efficiency in the face of naturally occurring random (stochastic) changes in key parameters. Data from a new commercial plant in East Java, Indonesia are used. The approach was to define an underlying unit-operations model based on the indirect heat-loss method, together with an efficiency risk factor (p). Process behaviour is simulated using a refined Monte Carlo (Latin Hypercube) sampling of 20 key input parameters that include coal feed and quality. The CFB is expected to operate at an efficiency of η=82.82%. Below 77.82% the process is characterized as 'fail' due to the greater coal needed to produce steam quantity and quality, and the potential for damage to the boiler. Results reveal an underlying risk of 73 failures in CFB efficiency per 10,000 operations. This equates on average to three failures each year over a prolonged period. This new information cannot be obtained from alternative hazard and risk approaches. A number of changes to the CFB to cut efficiency failures are illustrated using Fr 13 methodology. It is shown to be a practical design tool for improving process reliability and costs. A major benefit is that it can be used in design synthesis and analysis. Findings will be of benefit to operators and manufacturers of boiler equipment. © 2015.","Efficiency failure in a CFB; Friday 13th risk modelling; Fuel-to-steam efficiency in a coal-fired-boiler (CFB); Stochastic failure in CFB efficiency","Abdul-Halim, N., Davey, K.R., A new Friday 13th risk assessment of UV irradiation for potable water in turbulent flow (2015) Food Control, 50, pp. 770-777; Anderson, E., Hattis, D., Foundations: uncertainty and variability (1999) Risk Anal., 19 (1), pp. 47-49; Blackett Review of High Impact Low Probability Risks (2012), http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/goscience/docs/b/12-519-blackett-review-high-impact-low-probability-risks.pdf, Anon.

Worldwide proven oil, gas and coal reserves are 1688billion barrels (Bb), 6558trillion cubic feet (TCF) and 891billion tons (Bt) being consumed at rates of 0.092Bb, 0.329TCF and 7.89BT per day, respectively. The oil, gas and coal reserves are increasing at the rate of 600million barrels (Mb), 400billion cubic feet (BCF) and 19.2Giga tons of oil equivalents (GTOE) per year. While the rate of annual increase in consumption of oil, gas and coal is 1.4Mb, 4.5BCF and 3.1million tons (Mt). Global annual energy demand of over 12billion tons of oil equivalent (BTOE) results in the emission of 39.5Giga tons of carbon dioxide (Gt-CO<inf>2</inf>), and the annual CO<inf>2</inf> emission would increase up to 75 Gt-CO<inf>2</inf> when future energy demand will rise to 24-25BTOE. Oil, gas and coal may continue to exist for next several decades, yet the energy transition to low carbon intensity fuels is necessary to cope with rampant climate change. Renewable and alternative energy sources hold key to the solution of twin problems, energy and climate change, with a high initial investment. Transition from fossil fuels to sustainable and renewable energy resources of 150Petawatt hours (PWh) requires major investment and innovatory technologies. Perhaps CO<inf>2</inf> and H<inf>2</inf>O based fuel systems would facilitate climate change and grand energy transition. An energy mix consisting of fossil fuels, hydrogen, bio-fuels, and renewable energy sources seems to be a good initiative. This paper reviews evidence of hydrocarbons decline scenarios and timelines of future energy technologies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Energy crisis; Energy futures; Energy transition; Oil peaking","Abas, N., Khan, N., Carbon conundrum, climate change, CO<inf>2</inf> capture and consumptions (2014) International Journal of CO<inf>2</inf> Utilization, 8, pp. 39-48; Aleklett, K., (2007) Reserve driven forecasts for oil, gas and coal and limits in carbon dioxide emissions: Peak oil, peak gas, peak coal and peak CO<inf>2</inf>, , http://www.internationaltransportforum.org/jtrc/DiscussionPapers/DiscussionPaper18.pdf, OECD and Joint Transport Research Centre, Uppsala University, Sweden, (Discussion Paper No. 2007-18); Aleklett, K., Höök, M., Jakobsson, K., Lardelli, M., Snowden, S., Söderbergh, B., The peak of the oil age - Analyzing the world oil production reference scenario in world energy outlook (2008) Energy Policy, 38, pp. 1398-1414; Al-Fattah, S.M., Time series modeling for US natural gas forecasting (2005) Int.

We compare these two types of regulations in a global context taking into account heterogeneity in carbon content of both fossil fuels and renewable fuels. We find that although neither the ethanol mandate nor the emission standard is certain to reduce emissions relative to a business-as-usual baseline, at any given level of biofuel consumption in the policy region, a mandate, relative to an emission standard, results in higher GHG emissions, smaller expenditure on fuel imports, lower price of ethanol-blended gasoline and higher domestic fuel market surplus. This result holds over a wide range of values of model parameters. We also discuss the implications of this result to a regulation such as the US Renewable Fuel Standard given recent developments within the US such as increase in shale and tight oil production and large increase in average vehicle fuel economy of the automotive fleet. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Emission standard; Energy security; Mandate; Renewable energy; Transportation","Bento, A.M., Klotz, R., Landry, J.R., Are there carbon savings from US biofuel policies?

In the power generation sector, where fossil fuels are extensively used, these emissions could be reduced by capturing and storing the CO2 emitted. Between the different fossil fuels, coal is very interesting from an economic point of view (coal reservoirs are abundant and distributed homogenously on the earth) even if it produces a lot of carbon dioxide emissions.In this paper we have studied energy and economic performance of an integrated gasification combined cycle power plant (IGCC power plant equipped with an oxygen-blown gasifier) with CO2 capture based on the pre-combustion process and an advanced supercritical steam cycle (SSC) power plant with CO2 capture based on oxy-fuel combustion process. In these power plants great oxygen flow rates are necessary and so we have chosen an innovative technology for oxygen production based on oxygen transport membranes. The goal of this paper is the discussion of the main characteristics and performance of these membranes and the analysis of their integration in advanced coal-fired power plants. For each power plant, a full plant heat and mass balance is calculated in order to compare energy and environmental performance (net efficiency and CO2 specific emissions) and to evaluate the economic impacts of such CO2 emission abatement technologies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Integrated gasification combined cycle power plant (IGCC power plant); Oxygen combustion; Oxygen transport membranes (OTM); Supercritical steam cycle power plant (SSC power plant)","Allam, R., Improved oxygen production technologies (2009) Energy Proc., 1, pp. 461-470; Anantharaman, R., Bolland, O., Integration of oxygen transport membranes in an IGCC power plant with CO2 capture (2011) Chem.

The samples were collected with a micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI) in 11 size intervals ranging from 0.056μm to 18μm. The aerosol particle size distribution obtained from combined measurements with a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS; TSI 3936) and an aerosol particle sizer (APS; TSI 3321) is presented for comparison with MOUDI data. The analysis of δ13CTC values revealed that the total carbonaceous matter in size-segregated aerosol particles significantly varied from -23.4±0.1% in a coarse mode to -30.1±0.5% in a fine mode. A wide range of the δ13CTC values of size-segregated aerosol particles suggested various sources of aerosol particles contributing to carbonaceous particulate matter. Therefore, the source mixing equation was applied to verify the idea of mixing of two sources: continental non-fossil and fossil fuel combustion. The obtained δ13CTC value of aerosol particles originating from fossil fuel combustion was -28.0 to -28.1%, while the non-fossil source δ13CTC value was in the range of -25.0 to -25.5%. The two source mixing model applied to the size-segregated samples revealed that the fossil fuel combustion source contributed from 100% to 60% to the carbonaceous particulate matter in the fine mode range (Dp &lt; 1μm). Meanwhile, the second source, continental non-fossil, was the main contributor in the coarse fraction (Dp&gt;2μm). The particle range from 0.5 to 2.0μm was identified as a transition region where two sources almost equally contributed to carbonaceous particulate matter. The proposed mixing model offers an alternative method for determining major carbonaceous matter sources where radiocarbon analysis may lack the sensitivity (as in size-segregated samples). © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosol particles; Carbon isotopes; Carbon isotopic ratio; Isotopic mass balance equation; Source apportionment","Aiken, A., Salcedo, D., Cubison, M.J., Huffman, J., DeCarlo, P., Ulbrich, I.M., Docherty, K.S., Worsnop, D.R., Mexico City aerosol analysis during MILAGRO using high resolution aerosol mass spectrometry at the urban supersite (T0)-Part 1: fine particle composition and organic source apportionment (2009) Atmos.

Sub-Saharan Africa is a prime example of a region with many countries suffering from water scarcity. Water scarcity is quite possibly the most important issue that exists, seeing as it is the one essential resource for humans and all other life. Water scarcity in this region is somewhat ironic because of the numerous freshwater rivers that run throughout the region. The main reason for this water problem is the mismanagement and lack of energy required to redistribute the water. The water issue is inevitably linked to both energy resources and food resources. Water is the basis for all agriculture and is required for livestock. Water is also needed for almost any type of energy conversion. In a fossil fuel power plant, water is both the working fluid of the system and the coolant used in the condenser. In dams, the potential stored in flowing water is the basis of the creation of energy. Water, conversely, requires power to be transported and treated for drinking and agriculture. Sub-Saharan Africa has nearly maximized the energy of its large rivers, thus new sources of energy must be implemented to help with the energy crisis. A couple of the possibilities are fossil fuel power plants, geothermal power plants, and solar panels. Solar panels require a large amount of capital to build, but are nearly free to maintain, and can be cheaper in the long run. Solar power is an undeniably renewable resource and does not adversely affect the environment. Solar power can be utilized both for electricity generation and for irrigation and cooking in remote communities. Geothermal power plants utilize the potential stored in the earth's crust in places with volcanic activity. East Africa has an especially large potential for geothermal energy due to its many volcanoes. As for thermal power plants, combined cycle power plants paired with a salt water cooling system would greatly improve efficiency and drastically decrease water usage. By replacing Rankine cycle power plants that are used in most of Sub-Saharan Africa with either combined cycle plants or gas cycle plants, efficiencies would improve and far less water for cooling would be used in the system.

In this study, novel, biodegradable films were prepared from soy protein isolate (SPI), glycerol, polyacrylamide (PAM), and 1,2,3-propanetriol-diglycidyl-ether (PTGE). The mechanical, hydrophilic, biodegradation, and compatibility properties of the SPI/PAM/PTGE films were then thoroughly examined. The effects of the incorporation of PTGE and PAM on the properties of the films were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetry. Tests were also performed to determine total soluble matter, mechanical properties, and water barrier. Results showed that the mechanical properties and water resistance of the modified SPI films improved considerably after the incorporation of PAM and PTGE. Compared to traditional commercial polyethylene films, the PTGE/PAM-modified SPI films showed higher biodegradability, suggesting a convenient and efficient method of preparing environmentally-friendly film material. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","1,2,3-Propanetriol-diglycidyl-ether; Biodegradable films; Cross-linking; Polyacrylamide; Soy protein isolate","Bigi, A.Z., Cojazzi, G., Panzavolta, S., Rubini, K., Mechanical and thermal properties of gelatin films at different degrees of glutaraldehyde cross-linking (2001) Biomaterials, 22, pp. 763-768; Baztan, J., Carrasco, A., Chouinard, O., Cleaud, M., Gabaldon, J.E., Huck, T., Jaffres, L., Vanderlinden, J.P., Protected areas in the Atlantic facing the hazards of micro-plastic pollution: first diagnosis of three islands in the Canary Current (2014) Mar.

The present article provides a comparative ""cradle-to-grave"" life cycle assessment (LCA) of light duty commercial vehicles (LDCVs) powered by compressed natural gas (CNG) and diesel. The LCA scope is based on conditions for municipal vehicle fleet operation in a semi-urban Canadian city, suitable for adoption of alternative fuels such as CNG. An in-house application is developed to conduct the LCA with a combination of real-time vehicle fleet data and Natural Resources Canada's GHGenius as the inventory database. The results indicate that the net energy consumed is comparable for both fuels. Mixed results are obtained for criteria air contaminant (CAC) emissions, indicating the need for exhaust treatment for both vehicles. More importantly, a 34% reduction of GHG emissions is predicted by replacing the diesel vehicles with CNG vehicles. The analysis of fugitive methane emissions caused by newly developed hydraulic fracturing methods shows that CNG vehicles are still favorable. The lifetime fuel cost can also be reduced by about $30,000 per vehicle by switching to CNG. Therefore, fleet operators and policy developers are recommended to consider adoption of CNG-powered LDCVs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","CNG; Diesel; LCA; Light duty commercial vehicle; Natural gas","Akinnikawe, O., Ehlig-Economides, C., Reducing the Green house Gas emissions from the transportation sector (2010) J.Syst.

This paper outline why and how to do so. Traditionally, significant focus is put on the electricity sector alone to solve the renewable energy integration puzzle. Smart grid research traditionally focuses on ICT, smart meters, electricity storage technologies, and local (electric) smart grids. In contrast, the Smart Energy System focuses on merging the electricity, heating and transport sectors, in combination with various intra-hour, hourly, daily, seasonal and biannual storage options, to create the flexibility necessary to integrate large penetrations of fluctuating renewable energy. However, in this paper we present the development and design of coherent Smart Energy Systems as an integrated part of achieving future 100% renewable energy and transport solutions. The transition from fossil fuels towards the integration of more and more renewable energy requires rethinking and redesigning the energy system both on the generation and consumption side. To enable this, the Smart Energy System must have a number of appropriate infrastructures for the different sectors of the energy system, which are smart electricity grids, smart thermal grids (district heating and cooling), smart gas grids and other fuel infrastructures. It enables fluctuating renewable energy (such as wind, solar, wave power and low value heat sources) to utilise new sources of flexibility such as solid, gaseous, and liquid fuel storage, thermal storage and heat pumps and battery electric vehicles. Smart Energy Systems also enable a more sustainable and feasible use of bioenergy than the current types allow. It can potentially pave the way to a bioenergy-free 100% renewable energy and transport system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","100% Renewable energy systems; Energy storage; Gas grids; Smart Energy Systems; Smart grids; Thermal grids","Lund, H., Choice awareness: the development of technological and institutional choice in the public debate of Danish energy planning (2000) J Environ Planning Policy Manage, 2, pp. 249-259; Lund, H., Hvelplund, F., The economic crisis and sustainable development: the design of job creation strategies by use of concrete institutional economics (2012) Energy, 43, pp. 192-200; Mathiesen, B.V., Lund, H., Karlsson, K., 100% Renewable energy systems, climate mitigation and economic growth (2011) Appl Energy; Lund, H., Mathiesen, B.V., Energy system analysis of 100% renewable energy systems - the case of Denmark in years 2030 and 2050 (2009) Energy, 34, pp. 524-531. , 5; Ćosić, B., Krajačić, G., Duić, N., A 100% renewable energy system in the year 2050: the case of Macedonia (2012) Energy, 48, pp. 80-87; Peter, S., Doleschek, A., Lehmann, H., Mirales, J., Puig, J., Corominas, J., A pathway to a 100% renewable energy system for Catalonia (2007), http://www.isusi.de/downloads/Solar_Catalonia_2007_en.pdf, Institute of Sustainable Solutions and Innovations;Krajačić, G., Duić, N., Zmijarević, Z., Mathiesen, B.V., Vučinić, A.A., da Graça Carvalho, M., Planning for a 100% independent energy system based on smart energy storage for integration of renewables and CO2 emissions reduction (2011) Appl Therm Eng, 31, pp. 2073-2083; Connolly, D., Mathiesen, B.V., A technical and economic analysis of one potential pathway to a 100% renewable energy system (2014) Int J Sustain Energy Plan Manage, p. 1; Connolly, D., Lund, H., Mathiesen, B.V., Leahy, M., The first step towards a 100% renewable energy-system for Ireland (2011) Appl Energy, 88, pp. 502-507; Lund, H., Andersen, A.N., Ostergaard, P.A., Mathiesen, B.V., Connolly, D., From electricity smart grids to smart energy systems - a market operation based approach and understanding (2012) Energy, 42, pp. 96-102; Becker, S., Frew, B.A., Andresen, G.B., Zeyer, T., Schramm, S., Greiner, M., Features of a fully renewable US electricity system: optimized mixes of wind and solar PV and transmission grid extensions EnergyRyu, H., Dorjragchaa, S., Kim, Y., Kim, K., Electricity-generation mix considering energy security and carbon emission mitigation: case of Korea and Mongolia (2014) Energy, 64, pp. 1071-1079; Meibom, P., Barth, R., Hasche, B., Brand, H., Weber, C., O'Malley, M., Stochastic optimization model to study the operational impacts of high wind penetrations in Ireland (2011) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 26, pp. 1367-1379; Mason, I.G., Page, S.C., Williamson, A.G., A 100% renewable electricity generation system for New Zealand utilising hydro, wind, geothermal and biomass resources (2010) Energy Policy, 38, pp. 3973-3984; Krajacic, G., Duic, N., Carvalho, M., How to achieve a 100% RES electricity supply for Portugal?

This paper reviews the range and level of impurities expected from the main capture technologies used with fossil-fuelled power plants in addition to other CO2 emission-intensive industries. Analysis is presented with respect to the range of impurities present in CO2 streams captured using pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxy-fuel technologies, in addition to an assessment of the different parameters affecting the CO2 mixture composition. This includes modes of operation of the power plant, and different technologies for the reduction and removal of problematic components such as water and acid gases (SOx/NOx). A literature review of data demonstrates that the purity of CO2 product gases from carbon capture sources is highly dependent upon the type of technology used. This paper also addresses the CO2 purification technologies available for the removal of CO2 impurities from raw oxy-fuel flue gas, such as Hg and non-condensable compounds. CO2 purities of over 99% are achievable using post-combustion capture technologies with low levels of the main impurities of N2, Ar and O2. However, CO2 capture from oxy-fuel combustion and integrated gasification combined cycle power plants will need to take into consideration the removal of non-condensables, acid gas species, and other contaminants. The actual level of CO2 purity required will be dictated by a combination of transport and storage requirements, and process economics. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage; CCS; CO2 quality; Impurities","Allam, R.J., White, V., Miller, E.J., (2005) Purification of Carbon Dioxide, USA, , Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Allentown, US, US Patent No: 7,416,716; Anheden, M., Andersson, A., Bernstone, C., Eriksson, S., Yan, J., Liljemark, S., Wall, C., CO2 quality requirement for a system with CO2 capture, transport and storage (2004) Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies, pp. 2559-2564; Anheden, M., Burchhardt, U., Ecke, H., Faber, R., Jidinger, O., Giering, R., Kass, H., Yan, J., Overview of operational experience and results from test activities in Vattenfall's 30 MWth oxyfuel pilot plant in Schwarze Pumpe (2011) Energy Proc., 4, pp. 941-950; Apps, J.A., (2006) A Review of Hazardous Chemical Species Associated with CO2 Capture from Coal-Fired Power Plants and their Potential Fate During CO2 Geologic Storage, , Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Earth Sciences Division, LBNL-59731; Bourhy-Weber, C., Lockwood, F., Granados, L., Turmel, V., Callide oxyfuel project - results from the CPU (2013) 3rd Oxyfuel Combustion Conference.

Instead of releasing CO<inf>2</inf> into the atmosphere, its value can be recognized as a base C1 material for chemicals. In this study, a new CO<inf>2</inf> utilization strategy is developed via the hydrogenation of CO<inf>2</inf> derived ammonium carbamates/carbonates, which are the intermediates in industrial urea production or carbon capture processes, to produce value-added formate chemicals. A high yield of formate, ∼92%, was achieved after hydrogenating ammonium carbamates in the ethanol-water solution at room temperature with the carbon supported palladium nano-catalyst. The ethyl carbonate ions in the ammonium carbamate/carbonate solutions were speciated by 13C NMR and were attributed to the superior hydrogenation efficiency. Ammonium ions promote the formation of ethyl carbonate ions in the presence of ethanol. The solvent affects the distribution of the reactive intermediates. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Centi, G., Quadrelli, E.A., Perathoner, S., (2013) Energy Environ.

Given the abundance of this renewable raw material and its reduced impact on the food chain, it is an attractive source for replacing fossil fuels and obtaining chemicals or fuels in the context of a sustainable economy. In this work, a catalyst (Ru/AC) was developed to perform, in a single step, hydrolysis and hydrogenation of cellulose to sorbitol. An activated carbon supported ruthenium catalyst was examined for the one-pot hydrolytic hydrogenation of cellulose and it has shown to be very active and selective for the conversion of cellulose into sorbitol. When microcrystalline cellulose was used, a conversion of 36% was reached after 5 hours of reaction, with a selectivity to sorbitol of 40%. On the other hand, ball-milled cellulose allowed attaining conversions close to 90%, with a selectivity to sorbitol of 50%. Moreover, if the catalyst was ball-milled together with cellulose, the selectivity to sorbitol could be further increased to almost 80%. The catalyst showed excellent stability after repeated use. In this work we combined hydrolysis and hydrogenation in one-pot (using heterogeneous catalysts instead of homogeneous), in the presence of a Ru/AC catalyst (without any support pre-treatment with acids) and pre-treated cellulose just by ball-milling (instead of using acids). For this reason, the results obtained in this work are one of the best values achieved when using supported metal catalysts to convert cellulose by an environmentally friendly process. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.",,"Ruppert, A.M., Weinberg, K., Palkovits, R., (2012) Angew.

In Kansas, USA, optimal sites for wind energy development often overlap with preferred habitats of the Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido), a lek-mating prairie grouse of conservation concern. We tested for potential effects of energy development on male Greater Prairie-Chickens in north-central Kansas. We captured males at 23 leks located 0.04 to 28 km from wind turbines during a 2-yr preconstruction period (2007-2008) and a 3-yr postconstruction period (2009-2011). First, we tested for effects of proximity to turbines, habitat, and lek size on annual probability of lek persistence and changes in male numbers. We predicted that energy development might result in behavioral avoidance of areas close to turbines, resulting in increased rates of lek abandonment and fewer males attending surviving leks. We found that distance to turbine had a negative effect on lek persistence for leks ,8 km from turbines during the postconstruction period, supporting the 8-km buffer zone recommended by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an offset for wind energy projects. Additionally, lek persistence was positively related to number of males counted at a lek and with grassland cover surrounding the lek. Second, we tested for effects of wind energy development on male body mass. We predicted that degraded habitat conditions might result in decreased body mass for males attending leks near turbines during the postconstruction period. Male body mass was ~2% lower during the postconstruction period, but distance to turbine did not affect body mass. Additional study is needed to determine whether short-term effects of turbines on lek persistence influence population viability of Greater Prairie-Chickens. ©2015 Cooper Ornithological Society.","behavioral avoidance; Body mass; Grouse; Lek abandonment; Male age; Tympanuchus cupido; wind turbine","Allison, T., Anderson, D., Arness, E., Azeko, M., Bancroft, G.T., Boydston, K., Braud, R., Lawrence, L., (2010) Wind Turbine Guidelines Advisory Committee, , Secretary of the Interior USFWS Report; Arnold, T.W., Zink, R.M., Collision mortality has no discernible effect on population trends of North American birds (2011) PLOS One, 6, p. e24708; Aspbury, A.S., Gibson, R.M., Long-range visibility of Greater Sage-Grouse leks: A GIS-based analysis (2004) Animal Behaviour, 67, pp. 1127-1132; Augustine, J.K., Sandercock, B.K., Demography of female Greater Prairie-Chickens in unfragmented grasslands in Kansas (2011) Avian Conservation and Ecology, 6. , art2; Bachman, G., Widemo, F., Relationships between body composition, body size and alternative reproductive tactics in a lekking sandpiper, the Ruff (Philomachus pugnax) (1999) Functional Ecology, 13, pp. 411-416; Blickley, J.L., Blackwood, D., Patricelli, G.L., Experimental evidence for the effects of chronic anthropogenic noise on abundance of Greater (2012) Sage-Grouse at Leks.

We analyze how general equilibrium effects operating through the international capital market affect this Green Paradox. In a two-region, two-period world with identical homothetic preferences and without investment, the global interest rate falls and the Green Paradox weakens. With investment or a relatively more impatient oil-importing region, the Green Paradox may be strengthened because the future oil demand function shifts downward or because the interest rate rises. If the oil-importing region is very much more patient than the oil-exporting region, the Green Paradox may be reversed but in our calibrated model the effects are tiny. With exploration and endogenous initial oil reserves, a future carbon tax lowers cumulative oil extraction in partial equilibrium. If the boost to current oil extraction is weakened, strengthened or reversed in general equilibrium, so is the fall in cumulative extraction. A partial and general equilibrium welfare analysis of a future carbon tax, both for full and partial exhaustion, is given. The effects of stock-dependent extraction costs are separately discussed in an Appendix. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Capital markets; Carbon tax; General equilibrium; Global warming; Green Paradox","Cairns, R., The economics of exploration for non-renewable resources (1990) J.

Six of the most economically developed and populated regions in China and the U.S. were selected. The results showed that EV fuel-cycle emissions depend substantially on the carbon intensity and cleanness of the electricity mix, and vary significantly across the regions studied. In those regions with a low share of coal-based electricity (e.g., California), EVs can reduce GHG and air pollutant emissions (except for PM) significantly compared with conventional vehicles. However, in the Chinese regions and selected U.S. Midwestern states where coal dominates in the generation mix, EVs can reduce GHG emissions but increase the total and urban emissions of air pollutants. In 2025, EVs will offer greater reductions in GHG and air pollutant emissions because emissions from power plants will be better controlled; EVs in the Chinese regions examined, however, may still increase SO2 and PM emissions. Reductions of 60-85% in GHGs and air pollutants could be achieved were EVs charged with 80% renewable electricity or the electricity generated from the best available technologies of coal-fired power plants, which are futuristic power generation scenarios. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Electric vehicles; Fuel economy; Generation mix; Life-cycle analysis; Renewable electricity","(2013) Light Duty Electric Drive Vehicles Monthly Sales Updates, , http://www.transportation.anl.gov/technology_analysis/edrive_vehicle_monthly_sales.html, Available from:, (accessed Aug. 2013); Brown, E.G., (2013) 2013 ZEV Action Plan: a Roadmap toward 1.5 Million Zero-emission Vehicles on California Roadways by 2025, , http://opr.ca.gov/docs/Governor%27s_Office:ZEV_Action_Plan_(02-13).pdf, Available from:, (accessed July 2013); Cai, H., Wang, M., Elgowainy, A., Han, J., (2012) Updated Greenhouse Gas and Criteria Air Pollutant Emission Factors and Their Probability Distribution Functions for Electric Generating Units, , Argonne National Laboratory, ANL/ESD/12-2; (2013) California Electrical Energy Generation, 1983 to 2012, , http://energyalmanac.ca.gov/electricity/electricity_generation.html, Available from:, (accessed July 2013); Yearbook of Energy-Saving and New Energy Vehicles 2011, Beijing Guoneng Yingchuang Energy Information Technology Co.

Global economic and environmental benefits lead these markets to pursue overlapping goals, making them highly interactive. GenCos may identify optimal trading strategies for upstream and downstream trading in an integrated framework, to manage an overall secure and profitable position. Further, severe unpredictability of energy market prices may necessitate a GenCo to make trading plans which perform better meeting its goals. Under severe uncertainty of involved markets, this paper proposes Information Gap Decision Theory (IGDT) based approach to select three interrelated trading portfolios, in an integrated framework.

Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) is a novel combustion to improve the thermal efficiency of conventional SI engines at part loads. To understand the effect of alcohol structure on HCCI combustion under stoichiometric conditions highly diluted by exhaust gases, the combustion characteristics of n-butanol, ethanol and their blends with gasoline were investigated on a single cylinder port fuel injection gasoline engine with fixed intake/exhaust valve lifts at the same operating conditions in this study. The results show that autoignition timing for alcohol-gasoline blends is dependent on alcohol types and its concentration in the blend, engine speed and intake valve opening (IVO)/exhaust valve closing (EVC) timing. In the operating conditions with the residual gases more than 38% by mass in the mixture, alcohol-gasoline blends autoignite more easily than gasoline. Autoignition timing for n-butanol-gasoline blend is earlier than that for ethanol-gasoline blend with the same alcohol volume fraction at 1500 rpm in most cases while the autoignition timings for the blends with alcohol are relatively close at 2000 rpm at the same IVO/EVC timing. Combustion stability is improved with advanced EVC timing at a fixed IVO timing, which is benefit for the improvement in the thermal efficiency in the case of alcohol-gasoline blends. In addition, n-butanol-gasoline blends autoignite earlier than their ethanol-gasoline counterparts with identical oxygen mass content in the blend at the same IVO/EVC timings regardless of engine speeds. For alcohol-gasoline blends, the effect of IVO/EVC timing on the thermal efficiency of the HCCI engine is dependent on autoignition timing, fuel types and engine speeds. However, advanced autoignition timing for the blends with alcohol worsens the thermal efficiency of the HCCI engine in most cases. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The issue is even more important for the Italian economy, highly exposed to energy price changes, given its almost complete fossil fuel-related energy dependence, environmental sensitivity and highly fragmented industrial structure. Besides the policy issue, there is also an important methodological debate, concerning the best way to evaluate energy demand elasticities, looking at alternative models, data and elasticity definitions. After a discussion of the main methodological issues and the related empirical literature, this paper presents an estimation of factor and fuel demand elasticities for Italian industrial firms, by using a microeconomic panel in a two-stage translog model. Using cross-price and Morishima elasticities, we obtain information on the magnitude and asymmetry of firms' responses to price changes. Moreover, the use of a micro-dataset allows the high heterogeneity of Italian firms to be considered: the results are discussed according to technology intensity, sector and firm size. Our findings show that energy is the most elastic input for all sectors and that capital and energy are substitutes in the low technology sector and weak complements in all others. Estimated interfuel elasticities show a high degree of demand sensitivity to fuel price changes and the vast majority of cross-price elasticities exhibit substitutability. Appropriate fiscal policies can thus be identified to give an effective impulse in influencing the industrial energy mix by changing relative prices. These findings constitute an important foundation for analysing energy demand by Italian industrial firms, given that empirical literature is particularly rare on the Italian case study. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Capital-energy substitution; Fuel substitution; Microdata; Panel estimation","Arnberg, S., Bjørner, T.B., Substitution between energy, capital and labour within industrial companies: a micro panel data analysis (2007) Resour.

The end of the era of cheap and abundant energy flows brings the issue of economic growth into question, stimulating research for alternatives as the de-growth proposal. The present paper applies the system dynamic global model WoLiM that allows economic, energy and climate dynamics to be analyzed in an integrated way. The results show that, if the growth paradigm is maintained, the decrease in fossil fuel extraction can only be partially compensated by renewable energies, alternative policies and efficiency improvements, very likely causing systemic energy shortage in the next decades. If a massive transition to coal would be promoted to try to compensate the decline of oil and gas and maintain economic growth, the climate would be then very deeply disturbed. The results suggest that growth and globalization scenarios are, not only undesirable from the environmental point of view, but also not feasible. Furthermore, regionalization scenarios without abandoning the current growth GDP focus would set the grounds for a pessimistic panorama from the point of view of peace, democracy and equity. In this sense, an organized material de-growth in the North followed by a steady state shows up as a valid framework to achieve global future human welfare and sustainability. The exercise qualitatively illustrates the magnitude of the challenge: the most industrialized countries should reduce, on average, their per capita primary energy use rate at least four times and decrease their per capita GDP to roughly present global average levels. Differently from the current dominant perceptions, these consumption reductions might actually be welfare enhancing. However, the attainment of these targets would require deep structural changes in the socioeconomic systems in combination with a radical shift in geopolitical relationships. © 2015 Springer Japan","Fossil fuel depletion; Global warming; Peak oil; Renewable limits; Scenarios; System dynamics",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928380934

The method relies on geographically differentiated estimates of radiative forcing from albedo change associated with major land cover transitions derived from the Community Earth System Model. We find that conversion of 1 km2 of woody vegetation (forest and shrublands) to non-woody vegetation (crops and grassland) yields between 0 and −0.71 nW/m2 of globally averaged radiative forcing determined by the vegetation characteristics, snow dynamics, and atmospheric radiation environment characteristic within each of 151 regions we consider globally. Across a set of scenarios designed to span a range of potential future LULCC, we find LULCC forcing ranging from −0.06 to −0.29 W/m2 by 2070 depending on assumptions regarding future crop yield growth and whether climate policy favors afforestation or bioenergy crops. Inclusion of this previously uncounted forcing in the policy targets driving future climate mitigation efforts leads to changes in fossil fuel emissions on the order of 1.5 PgC/yr by 2070 for a climate forcing limit of 4.5 Wm−2, corresponding to a 12–67 % change in fossil fuel emissions depending on the scenario. Scenarios with significant afforestation must compensate for albedo-induced warming through additional emissions reductions, and scenarios with significant deforestation need not mitigate as aggressively due to albedo-induced cooling. In all scenarios considered, inclusion of albedo forcing in policy targets increases forest and shrub cover globally. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA)",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928155128

Because of the deleterious atmospheric effects of fossil fuels and the uncertainties of future energy supplies, there is a surge of interest to find environmentally friendly alternative energy sources.

Its impacts and costs will be large, serious, and unevenly spread, globally for decades. The main factor causing climate change and global warming is the increase of global carbon emissions produced by human activities such as deforestation and burning of fossil fuels. In this special volume, the articles mainly focus on investigations of technical innovations and policy interventions for improved energy efficiency and carbon emissions reduction in a wide diversity of industrial, construction and agricultural sectors at different scales, from the smallest scales (firm or household), cities, regional, to national and global scales. Some articles in this special volume assess alternative carbon emissions reduction approaches, such as carbon capture and storage and geoengineering schemes. Given the high cost and internal/external uncertainties of carbon capture and storage and risks and side effects of various geoengineering schemes, improved energy efficiency and widespread implementation of low fossil-carbon renewable-energy based systems are clearly the most direct and effective approaches to reduce carbon emissions. This means that we have to radically transform our societal metabolism towards low/no fossil-carbon economies. However, design and implementation of low/no fossil-carbon production will require fundamental changes in the design, production and use of products and these needed changes are evolving but much more needs to be done. Additionally, the design and timing of suitable climate policy interventions, such as various carbon taxation/trading schemes, must be integral in facilitating the development of low fossil carbon products and accelerating the transition to post-fossil carbon societies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture and storage; Carbon emissions reduction; Carbon trade/tax schemes; Geoengineering approaches; Implementation of low-fossil carbon energy systems; Improved energy use efficiency",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928902445

Whether modern economies can find a smooth path away from fossil fuels is a fundamental socio-economic and political question, which according to standard economics depends to a large extent on the degree of substitution between energy and capital. We study this issue by modelling the manufacturing sector with a translog cost function in seven OECD countries using the EU-KLEMS database for the period 1970–2005. After a literature survey, different production structures accounting for input substitution, returns to scale and technical change are estimated, and substitution elasticities are derived. Our results indicate a general complementarity or weak substitution relationship between energy and capital, suggesting that an increase in energy price, e.g. due to climate policy or scarcer fossil fuels, will likely reduce capital inputs, which might lead to a lower output of manufacturing. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Cross-Price Elasticity; Energy-capital substitution; Translog cost function",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928138168

However, some concerns exist about their possible effects on the marine environment and biota. Such plants showed to cause the production of foam, as occurred at the still operative terminal of Porto Viro (northern Adriatic Sea). Here, we present results from two microcosm experiments focused on the effects of such foam on microbially mediated degradation processes and its consequent incorporation within the pelagic food web. Such material could be considered as a heterogeneous matrix of both living and non-living organic matter, which constitutes an important substrate for exoenzymes as suggested by the faster hydrolytic rates measured in the treatment microcosms. In the second experiment, a quite immediate and efficient carbon transfer to planktonic biomass through prokaryotic incorporation and consequent predation by heterotrophic flagellates was highlighted. Although no negative effect was evidenced on the overall microbes’ growth and foam-derived C seemed to be easily reworked and transferred to higher trophic levels, an important reduction in biodiversity was evidenced for microalgae. Among them, mixotrophic organisms seemed to be favoured suggesting that the addition of foam could cause a modification of the microbial community structure. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Exoenzymatic activities; Foam; Heterotrophic C production; Liquefied natural gas; Microcosms; Pelagic food web; Prokaryotes",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927938130

However, the reliance on fossil fuels leads to the significant depletion of natural resources of buried combustible geologic deposits and to negative effects on the global climate with emissions of greenhouse gases. Accordingly, enormous efforts are directed to transition from fossil fuels to nonpolluting and renewable energy sources. One potential alternative is biohydrogen (H<inf>2</inf>), a clean energy carrier with high-energy yields; upon the combustion of H<inf>2</inf>, H<inf>2</inf>O is the only major by-product. In recent decades, the attractive and renewable characteristics of H<inf>2</inf> led us to develop a variety of biological routes for the production of H<inf>2</inf>. Based on the mode of H<inf>2</inf> generation, the biological routes for H<inf>2</inf> production are categorized into four groups: photobiological fermentation, anaerobic fermentation, enzymatic and microbial electrolysis, and a combination of these processes. Thus, this review primarily focuses on the evaluation of the biological routes for the production of H<inf>2</inf>. In particular, we assess the efficiency and feasibility of these bioprocesses with respect to the factors that affect operations, and we delineate the limitations. Additionally, alternative options such as bioaugmentation, multiple process integration, and microbial electrolysis to improve process efficiency are discussed to address industrial-level applications. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Bioenergy; Biohydrogen; Dark fermentation; Photofermentation; Renewable resources","Goldemberg, J., Environmental and ecological dimensions of biofuels (2008) Proceedings of the Conference on the Ecological Dimensions of Biofuels, , Washington, DC, USA, 10 March; Venkata Mohan, S., Pandey, A., Biohydrogen production: An introduction (2013) Biohydrogen, pp. 1-24. , Pandey, A., Chang, J.-S., Hallenbeck, P.C., Larroche, C., Eds.; Elsevier: Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Lee, S.J., Lee, S.J., Lee, D.W., Design and development of synthetic microbial platform cells for bioenergy (2013) Front.

In this study, the performance and emission characteristics of biodiesel blends of 10, 30 and 50 % from waste cooking oil based on hydrodynamic cavitation were compared to diesel fuel, and found to be acceptable according to the EN 14214 and ASTM D 6751 standards. The tests have been performed using an in-line vertical six-cylinder diesel engine at different engine speeds, ranging from 1000 to 2000 rpm under full throttle load. During engine performance tests, biodiesel blends showed higher brake specific fuel consumption (2.1–9.0 %) and exhaust gas temperature (1.0–6.8 %), while lower brake power (1.6–6.7 %), torque (0.6–5.2 %) and brake thermal efficiency (1.9–8.4 %) than diesel fuel. Engine emissions showed higher carbon dioxide (8.7–38.5 %) and nitrogen oxide (4.7–19.0 %) releases, but surprisingly decreased amount of carbon monoxide (3.3–26.3 %) for biodiesel blends compared to diesel fuel. Although higher carbon dioxide amounts were emitted, the use of biodiesel greatly reduced the life cycle circulation of carbon dioxide. Waste cooking methyl ester produced by using hydrodynamic cavitation seems to be relatively easy to scale up to higher production values, is energy efficient, time saving and eco-friendly, which results in biodiesel being a viable fuel for industrial production. The waste cooking oil-based biodiesel can also be used without any engine modifications. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Diesel engine; Emission; Hydrodynamic cavitation; Performance; Waste cooking oil",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927534112

Co-processing bitumen derived feeds and biomass may provide an alternative solution since the level of GHG emissions for producing renewable biofuels is considered significantly lower than that for fossil fuels. In many developed countries, it is required that biofuels replace from 6% to 10% of petroleum fuels in the near future. Co-processing biomass and bitumen feeds can use existing refining infrastructure and technologies, saving capital and operating costs. In addition, co-processing may generate synergies that improve gasoline and diesel qualities. The current study investigates the catalytic cracking performances of pure heavy gas oil (HGO) derived from oil sands synthetic crude and a mixture of 15 v% canola oil in HGO using a commercial equilibrium catalyst under typical FCC conditions. Cracking experiments were performed using a bench-scale Advanced Cracking Evaluation (ACE) unit at fixed weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 8 h-1, 490-530 C, and catalyst/oil ratios of 4-12 g/g. Higher conversion, dry gas yield, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) yield were observed at a given catalyst/oil ratio when cracking the HGO/canola oil blend compared with pure HGO. The increase in dry gas yield can be attributed to the decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions in the presence of triglycerides composed of fatty acids in the feed, leading to the formation of CO<inf>2</inf> and CO. In general, at a given conversion, the addition of canola oil resulted in lower gasoline yield at the expense of water formation. As well, lower coke yield was observed for the blend. The relatively high nitrogen content in the feeds played an important role in catalyst activity and selectivity, particularly at low reaction temperatures. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Advanced Cracking Evaluation (ACE) unit; Canola oil; Fatty acids; Gasoline precursors; Oil sands heavy gas oil (HGO)","Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), (2012) Canadian crude oil production supply forecast, , June; Towards sustainable production and use of resources: Assessing biofuels; Sheehan, J., Camobresco, V., Duffield, J., Graboski, M., Shapouri, H., Life cycle inventory for biodiesel and petroleum diesel for use in an urban bus (1998) Final Report by US Department of Agriculture and US Department of Energy, , May; (2010) Canada Gazette, Part II: Renewable Fuels Regulations, , September 1; (2009) EU Renewable Energy Directive (Dir 2009/28/EC), , April 23; Dupain, X., Costa, D.J., Schaverien, C.J., Makkee, M., Moulijn, J.A., Cracking of a rapeseed vegetable oil under realistic FCC conditions (2007) Appl Catal B: Environ, 72, pp. 44-61; Tian, H., Li, C., Yang, C., Shan, H., Alternative processing technology for converting vegetable oils and animal fats to clean fuels and light olefins (2008) Chin J Chem Eng, 16 (3), pp. 394-400; Melero, J.A., Clavero, M.M., Calleja, G., Garcia, A., Miravalles, R., Galindo, T., Production of biofuels via the catalytic cracking of mixtures of crude vegetable oils and nonedible animal fats with vacuum gas oil (2010) Energy Fuels, 24, pp. 707-717; Bielansky, P., Reichhold, A., Schönberger, C., Catalytic cracking of rapeseed oil to high octane gasoline and olefins (2010) Chem Eng Process, 49, pp. 873-880; Bielansky, P., Weinert, A., Schonberger, C., Reichhold, A., Catalytic conversion of vegetable oils in a continuous FCC pilot plant (2011) Fuel Process Technol, 92, pp. 2305-2311; Al-Sabawi, M., Chen, J., Ng, S., Fluid catalytic cracking of biomass-derived oils and their blends with petroleum feedstocks: a review (2012) Energy Fuels, 26, pp. 5355-5372; Przybylski, R., Mag, T., Eskin, N.A.M., McDonald, B.E., (2005) Canola oil in Bailey's industrial oil and fat products (Chapter 2), , 6th ed John Wiley & Sons Inc Hoboken, New Jersey; Ng, S.H., Wang, J., Fairbridge, C., Zhu, Y.X., Yang, L., Ding, F., Study of Canadian FCC feeds from various origins and treatments. 1.

Rice and coffee husk are biomass residues from the agriculture while elephant grass (Pennisetum Purpureum Schum) is an abundant, fast growing plant, which is used for cattle breeding. The ultimate analysis of the biomass materials was carried out in the research department of a Brazilian Steelmaking Industry. The results of the ultimate analysis were used to determine the lower calorific value and the mass flow rate of the biomass materials used in the cogeneration system. The actual steelmaking process uses natural gas to both improve the ""cold spots"" inside the furnace and contribute to minimize the use of electrical energy in the heating process. The feasibility study considers a combined heat and power plant (CHP) to generate electricity and heat to the electric arc furnace (EAF) process. This study used the First Law of Thermodynamics to determine the operational parameters of the cogeneration plant considering three cases of different operational parameters in the Rankine cycle. The technical results show that the natural gas consumption and exhaust gas generation were the lowest among the fuels in the three cases analyzed. Regarding the exhaust gases generation, some aspects should be highlighted: the combustion of biomass is considered carbon neutral; the exhaust gases generated may be used to scrap preheat; also, biomass is a renewable fuel in contrast with natural gas, which is a fossil fuel. Thus, an economic analysis, considering only the operational cost of the plant, was conducted exhibiting that elephant grass had the lowest operational cost, accounting for a reduction of about 9% in the second case and 15% in the third case compared to natural gas. Although the biomasses have lower LCV than natural gas, they showed a great promise of their use in the EAF process indicating their feasibility as an excellent alternative for the process of producing iron. ©2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In cooperation between Surface Engineering Institute (IOT) and Gear Research Center (FZG), surface modifications in terms of stochastic and deterministic structures, diamond-like carbon (DLC) and nitride hard physical vapor deposition (PVD) coatings were tested in lubricated rolling-sliding contacts in twin-disk and gear efficiency test-rig. It was found that deterministic structured surfaces provide for reduction of friction losses by up to 7% under extreme boundary friction conditions at high Hertzian stresses and small relative lubricant film thicknesses. Application-oriented tests using DLC coated gear wheels in gear efficiency test-rig exhibited a reduction of friction losses between 10% and 21% compared to uncoated gear wheels. The DLC coating ZrCg developed at IOT provided for friction reduction of 15% for small circumferential speeds in boundary friction. Friction losses were reduced by up to 39% at higher circumferential speeds in spite of fully separated surfaces in the fluid friction regime. Due to their thermophysical properties, it is assumed that DLC coatings have an impact on viscosity and shear resistance of the lubricant. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Diamond-like carbon (DLC); Gears; PVD coatings; Rolling-sliding; Thermal effects; Tribophysics","Kosarieh, S., Morina, A., Lainé, E., Flemming, J., Neville, A., Tribological performance and tribochemical processes in a DLC/steel system when lubricated in a fully formulated oil and base oil (2013) Surf.

Hydrogen-fuelled engines are known for several advantages, among which is the very low concentration of pollutants in the exhaust gases compared with internal combustion engines using traditional or other alternative fuels. Hydrogen-driven vehicles thus reduce both local and global emissions. It is an energy carrier that can be used in internal combustion engines or fuel cells producing virtually no greenhouse gas emissions when combusted with oxygen. The only significant emission is water vapour. The effect of blending of hydrogen with gasoline is analysed in this current paper.

In particular, methanol, with a gravimetric hydrogen content of 12.6%, is a promising target for chemical hydrogen storage. To date, there are relatively few homogeneous transition metal compounds that catalyze the aqueous phase dehydrogenation of methanol to release hydrogen and carbon dioxide. In general, these catalysts utilize expensive precious metals and require a strong base. This paper shows that a pincer-supported Fe compound and a co-catalytic amount of a Lewis acid are capable of catalyzing base-free aqueous phase methanol dehydrogenation with turnover numbers up to 51 000. This is the highest turnover number reported for either a first-row transition metal or a base-free system. Additionally, this paper describes preliminary mechanistic experiments to understand the reaction pathway and propose a stepwise process, which requires metal-ligand cooperativity. This pathway is supported by DFT calculations and explains the role of the Lewis acid co-catalyst.(Chemical Equation Presented). © 2015 American Chemical Society.","catalysis; DFT calculations; Iron; metal-ligand cooperativity; methanol dehydrogenation; pincer ligands","Dincer, I., (1999) Energy Policy, 27, pp. 845-854; Lewis, N.S., Nocera, D.G., (2006) Proc.

Nevertheless, the related costs, including the energy required for sterilization, remain a barrier to commercialization. This study thus used a low-pH non-sterile medium, instead of a completely sterilized one, to grow R. glutinis in a 5-L airlift bioreactor. The results show that R. glutinis can grow well at a low pH level of 4.0 and without sterilization of the medium, producing a final biomass of 11.7 g/L. Nevertheless, such a low pH will lead to fewer total lipids accumulation, and so a two-stage process of pH control in a non-sterile batch was proposed. Even this two-stage pH operation was also able to produce a similar final biomass of 11.7 g/L. However, the batch with two-stage pH control had a far higher lipid content of 55 ± 4 % as compared to that of 21 ± 3 % in the batch grown at pH 4.0. This study shows the potential of the proposed non-sterile process with two-stage pH control applied to the growth of R. glutinis to enhance the total lipid accumulation. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Biodiesel; Bioenergy; Contamination; Non-sterile; SCO",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926149951

Some studies have even suggested that global warming could be slowed down in the short term by eliminating BC emission due to its short lifetime. In this study, we estimate the influence of removing some sources of BC and other co-emitted species on the aerosol radiative effect by using an aerosol-climate atmosphere-only model BCC-AGCM2.0.1-CUACE/Aero with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea ice cover, in combination with the aerosol emissions from the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios. We find that the global annual mean aerosol net cooling effect at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) will be enhanced by 0.12 W m-2 compared with recent past year 2000 levels if the emissions of only BC are reduced to the level projected for 2100 based on the RCP2.6 scenario. This will be beneficial∼for the mitigation of global warming. However, both aerosol negative direct and indirect radiative effects are weakened when BC and its co-emitted species (sulfur dioxide and organic carbon) are simultaneously reduced. Relative to year 2000 levels, the global annual mean aerosol net cooling effect at the TOA will be weakened by 1.7-2.0 W m-2 if the emissions of all these aerosols are decreased to the levels projected for 2100 in different ways based on the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios. Because there are no effective ways to remove the BC exclusively without influencing the other co-emitted components, our results therefore indicate that a reduction in BC emission can lead to an unexpected warming on the Earth's climate system in the future. © Author(s) 2015.",,"Abdul-Razzak, H., Ghan, S.J., A parameterization of aerosol activation, 2.

Six different scenarios were investigated, half of which involved hybridisation with fossil fuels (natural gas, coal and fuel oil), and the other three involved hybridisation with renewable fuels (wheat straw, wood pellets and biogas). Each scenario was compared to a solar-only operation. Nine different environmental categories as well as the Cumulative Energy Demand and the Energy Payback Time (EPT) were evaluated using Simapro software for 1 MW h of electricity produced. The results indicate a worse environmental performance for a CSP plant producing 12% of the electricity from fuel than in a solar-only operation for every indicator, except for the eutrophication and toxicity categories, whose results for the natural gas scenario are slightly better. In the climate change category, the results ranged between 26.9 and 187 kg CO2 eq/MW h, where a solar-only operation had the best results and coal hybridisation had the worst. Considering a weighted single score indicator, the environmental impact of the renewable fuels scenarios is approximately half of those considered in fossil fuels, with the straw scenario showing the best results, and the coal scenario the worstones. EPT for solar-only mode is 1.44 years, while hybridisation scenarios EPT vary in a range of 1.72-1.83 years for straw and pellets respectively. The fuels with more embodied energy are biomethane and wood pellets. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In past few decades there has been an enormous amount of researches to reduce the energy and environmental cost by using alternative fuel and raw material. In recent years utilisation of alternative fuels in cement manufacturing has gained a wide attention due to its effectiveness in substituting the thermal energy requirement from fossil fuels and reducing the pollutant emission. Alkaline environment, high temperature and long residence time allow rotary kiln to burn a wide range of waste and hazardous material. Recent development on the usage of alternative fuels in cement industry is presented in this paper and many of the research articles relevant to this study is reviewed and discussed. Studies on the impact of alternative fuels on environmental emission have also been included in this review. This paper provides a thorough understanding and status of alternative fuels and their usage in cement industry and highlights their positive impact on environment. This study offers a guideline for planning and implementing alternative fuel usage in cement industry around the world, particularly in Australia. The paper revealed that meat and bone meal (MBM) could be the best alternative fuel option for Australia with a substitution rate of 40%. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Biodiesel has attracted considerable attention in recent years as an alternative to fossil fuels, since it is renewable, biodegradable and non-toxic. Biodiesel can be obtained from animal fat, vegetable oils including cooking oil. In this work, a method of producing biodiesel from seed cake waste from the edible Jatropha curcas L. plant was developed. Oil extraction using hexane gave the best oil quality. Transesterifications of approximately 95% were obtained by alkali or acid catalysis, and the obtained biodiesel products were successfully corroborated with NMR techniques. Since J.curcas is a non-toxic plant, the remaining de-oiled cake was tested for its nutritional properties. Nutritional analysis showed a content of 43% and 33% of protein and carbohydrate, respectively; suggesting that this waste can be used as an attractive protein and carbohydrate source for fermentation processes and/or for formulations for animal feeding. In conclusion, this work provides evidence that the oil from an edible and non-toxic species of J.curcas is an attractive option for biodiesel production with nutritional applications and negligible wasting. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Animal food; Biodiesel; Jatropha curcas; Methyl esters; Oil; Transesterification","Xue, W., Zhou, Y.C., Song, B.A., Shi, X., Wang, J., Yin, S.T., Synthesis of biodiesel from Jatropha curcas L. seed oil using artificial zeolites loaded with CH3COOK as heterogeneous catalyst (2009) Nat Sci, 1, pp. 55-62; Leung, D.J.C., Wu, X., Leung, M.K.H., Areview on biodiesel production using catalyzed transesterification (2010) Appl Energy, 87, pp. 1083-1095; Kumar, A., Sharma, S., An evaluation of multipurpose oil seed crop for industrial uses (Jatropha curcas L.): a review (2008) Ind Crops Prod, 28, pp. 1-10; Becker, K., Makkar, H.P.S., Toxic effects of phorbol esters in carp (Cyprinus carpio L.)

Ethanol has been claimed to be a potential candidate to replace oil use to great extent. This study illustrates that ethanol production has the potential to rely on organic agriculture and thereby to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Case studies were carried out by examining three farms (2 conventional, 1 organic) in Austria who are mainly producing sugar beet. We found that organic sugar beet production provided an overall energy return on investment (EROI) of 11.3 whereas the conventional farming practice showed an EROI of 14.1 and 15, respectively. Our study indicates that organic sugar beet production shows potential to substitute conventional industrial sugar beet production to provide inputs to ethanol production. By using organically produced sugar beets as inputs to the ethanol production, fossil fuels can perhaps be avoided to a large extent in the production process, thus, it may be possible to mitigate some of the environmental impacts associated with ethanol production. Larger studies are however needed to better visualise such results. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioeconomy; Ecological energetics; Energy return on investment (EROI); Organic farming; Sugar beet","Murphy, D.J., Hall, C.A., Dale, M., Cleveland, C., Order from chaos: a preliminary protocol for determining the EROI of fuels (2011) Sustainability, 3 (10), pp. 1888-1907; Guilford, M.C., Hall, C.A., OíConnor, P., Cleveland, C.J., A new long term assessment of energy return on investment (EROI) for US oil and gas discovery and production (2011) Sustainability, 3 (10), pp. 1866-1887; Cleveland, C.J., Net energy from the extraction of oil and gas in the United States (2005) Energy, 30 (5), pp. 769-782; Gupta, A.K., Hall, C.A., A review of the past and current state of EROI data (2011) Sustainability, 3 (10), pp. 1796-1809; Atlason, R., Unnthorsson, R., Energy return on investment of hydroelectric power generation calculated using a standardised methodology (2014) Renew Energy, 66, pp. 364-370; Atlason, R., Unnthorsson, R., Hot water production improves the energy return on investment of geothermal power plants (2013) Energy, 51, pp. 273-280; Atlason, R., Unnthorsson, R., Ideal EROI (energy return on investment) deepens the understanding of energy systems (2014) Energy, 67, pp. 241-245; Gustavsson, L., Holmberg, J., Dornburg, V., Sathre, R., Eggers, T., Mahapatra, K., Using biomass for climate change mitigation and oil use reduction (2007) Energy Policy, 35 (11), pp. 5671-5691; Goldemberg, J., Ethanol for a sustainable energy future (2007) Science, 315 (5813), pp. 808-810; Hall, C.A., Cleveland, C.J., Kaufmann, R.K., (1992) Energy and resource quality: the ecology of the economic process, , USA.

Therefore, all nations must develop alternative energy resources to reduce the potential risk of exhausting the available fossil fuel energy supply and to resolve environmental degradation.The amount of sunlight and installed power capacity are crucial factors that influence solar photovoltaic (PV) efficiency. Among domestic and international studies, numerous scholars have proposed various installed power capacity assessment models, which typically calculate areas based on sub-fields, ground floors or per capita. However, an evaluation of the potential of solar PV power generation on rooftops indicated that the shadow effect caused by building structures substantially influence the amount of installed power capacity. This study aims to effectively compute the shadow areas (shaded areas) on rooftops. By using the Hillshade module, the buildings' elevation data and the solar azimuth and altitude angles at different hours were calculated to obtain the hourly sun/shade grayscale values. The grayscale values were then integrated into binary images to calculate the shadow areas on rooftops.This study suggests that the rooftop solar photovoltaic installation capacity is some 12,428.5MW and power generation capacity 15,423.75GWh in Taiwan. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Geographic information systems (GIS); Hillshade; Rooftop solar photovoltaic; Threshold value","Zai-Cian, L., Rong-Jhang, W., Ming-Jhao, J., Ruo-Ci, Z., Shih-Tong, J., Huei-Long, L., Progress in mining & Metallurgical industries in Taiwan (2012) Min Metallurgical Part 1, 57 (2), pp. 71-118; http://web3.moeaboe.gov.tw/ECW/populace/web_book/WebReports.aspx?book=M_CH%26menu_id=142.2013.10.22, Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Wei-Lun, H., (2002) Distributed power technology application, p. 31. , Bureau of Energy, [Ministry of Economic Affairs energy report]; Wiginton, L.K., Nguyen, H.T., Pearce, J.M., Quantifying rooftop solar photovoltaic potential for regional renewable energy policy, computers (2010) Environ Urban Syst, 34 (4), pp. 345-357; Ordonez, J., Jadraque, E., Alegre, J., Martinez, G., Analysis of the photovoltaic solar energy capacity of residential rooftops in Andalusia (Spain) (2010) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 14 (7), pp. 2122-2130; Bergamasco, L., Asinari, P., Scalable methodology for the photovoltaic solar energy potential assessment based on available roof surface area: application to Piedmont Region (Italy) (2011) Sol Energy, 85 (5), pp. 1041-1055; Bergamasco, L., Asinari, P., Scalable methodology for the photovoltaic solar energy potential assessment based on available roof surface area: further improvements by ortho-image analysis and application to Turin (Italy) (2011) Sol Energy, 85 (11), pp. 2741-2756; Vardimon, R., Assessment of the potential for distributed photovoltaic electricity production in Israel (2011) Renew Energy, 36 (2), pp. 591-594; Cheng-Dar, Y., Ming-Hau, Y., Ying-Yue, L., Hong-Dar, T., The potential and economic evaluation of local renewable Energy sources (2006) JEnviron Prot Soc Taiwan, 29 (1), pp. 11-28; (1999) Total report of research, development, and planning of renewable energy and clean energy; Fu-Guang, G., Thinking on power development planning towards a low-carbon economy (2010) Mon J Taipower's Eng, (747), pp. 89-110; Falin, C., Shyi-Min, L., Kuo-Tung, T., Si-Chen, L., Eric, W., Assessment of renewable energy reserves in Taiwan (2010) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 14 (9), pp. 2511-2528; (2011) The 2011 annual executive report of the research and development plan for Energy Technology of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (modification), the research and analysis plan of the wholesale purchase of renewable energy and fund fee rate (the first year); Shih-Mo, L., (2011) Technical-economic and cost-benefit analysis of Taiwan PV and cellulosic ethanol industries, , [Report of commissioned plan and research of Atomic Energy Council]; Cheng-Dar, Y., Guo-Rong, H., An evaluation of domestic solar energy potential in Taiwan incorporating land use analysis (2011) Energy Policy, 39 (12), pp. 7988-8002; The elevation of four seasons and Azimuth in Taiwan http://www.cwb.gov.tw/V7/astronomy/cdata/season.htmhttp://sowf.moi.gov.tw/stat/year/list.htmWen-Sheng, O., Ming-Chin, H., Jui-Ling, C., Jian-Fu, C., Shih-Chi, L., The study on the typical radiation for solar architecture design of Taiwan (2008) JArchit, (64), pp. 103-118; Shian-De, L., Guo-Tsang, H., Taiwan TMY2 study and application of typical meteorological year (2005) Build J, 53, pp. 79-94; Burrough, P.A., McDonell, R.A., (1998) Principles of geographical information systems, p. 190. , Oxford University Press, New York; http://www.esri.comOtsu, N., Athreshold selection method from gray-level histograms (1979) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybernet SMC, 9 (1), pp. 62-66; Yi, P., (1994) Design of daylight in building, , Scientific & Technical Publishing Co., Ltd., Taipei; Guo-Chang, S., Bo-Jyun, H., Mao-Ting, H., Wei-Min, L., Mei-Huei, Z., Performance analysis of PV systems in Taiwan (2013) Taiwan-Saudi Arabia Electr Assoc J, (14); http://www.taipower.com.twCuei-Hua, S., (2003) Research in the solar radiation of Taiwan and the potential of solar powered energy generator, , National Taiwan Normal University Department of Geography, [Master's thesis]; Zhang, Z., Ying, L., Application of GIS combining with limits of voronoi diagram in socioeconomic factor of agricultural land grading (2009) Comput Comput Technol Agric II, 293, pp. 423-430; (2013) The challenge and opportunity of energy and power industries in Taiwan, , CTCI Foundation, [Special Report]",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84916631981

In order to be a successful candidate, there must be enough fertilizers available to support large scale production. Commercial fertilizers are available for biofuel production from the world fertilizer surplus, but due to nitrogen and phosphorus future production limitations, biofuels would ideally not use any of these resources to be a long term sustainable fuel. Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium requirements were determined for two algal species, Chlorella and Nannochloropsis, to produce 19 billion. l per year (BLPY). At this scale, both algal species would use 32-49%, 32-49% and less than 1% of the world surplus values of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, respectively. Nutrient recycling options and alternative sources of nutrients were evaluated to determine their potential contribution of lowering the synthetic fertilizer requirement. Results show that all of the recycling scenarios reduce the nutrient requirements, but catalytic hydrothermal gasification has the largest reduction of 95% of the nitrogen and 90% of the phosphorus. Contributions from all alternative sources can also provide only 5% or less of the required nitrogen when produced in the gulf region. For phosphorus in the same region, poultry concentrated animal feeding operations can provide up to 28% of the requirement of Chlorella. To find the least amount of nitrogen that may be used, catalytic hydrothermal gasification was combined with all of the alternative nutrients available in the gulf region. The maximum amount of biofuels that could be produced in this location without using any synthetic fertilizers is 50. ±. 20 BLPY from Chlorella and 45. ±. 19 BLPY from Nannochloropsis. This study shows that the nutrient requirement for biofuel production from microalgae will not be a limitation if recycling methods within the process chain and alternative sources of nutrients are utilized. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Alternative fuels; Fertilizers; Microalgae to biodiesel; Sustainability","Chisti, Y., Biodiesel from microalgae (2007) Biotechnol Adv, 25, pp. 294-306; Pfromm, P.H., Amanor-Boadu, V., Nelson, R., Sustainability of algae derived biodiesel: a mass balance approach (2011) Bioresour Technol, 102, pp. 1185-1193; Maggio, G., Cacciola, G., When will oil, natural gas, and coal peak?

This is unsustainable in the long run both with respect to energy security and climate change problems. Fuel switching, specifically using biomass may partially address this problem. Polygeneration is an efficient way of delivering multiple utility outputs with one or more inputs. Decentralized small or large scale polygeneration using alternative fuels may be a future sustainable solution. In this paper, a techno-economic evaluation of a polygeneration with four utility outputs and rice straw as input has been reported. Results of the simulation and real-life data as inputs are used for the techno-economic analysis. The analysis is specific for a district in the state of West Bengal of India.

Better emission control has removed stabilizing organic ligands hence dissolved Fe(II) currently occurs more as inorganic iron, which is not protected against oxidation. Increasing rainwater pH allows oxidation by molecular O2 in addition to H2O2 and also increases the ratio of the ion pair Fe(OH)+ to Fe(II) free ion, which increases the oxidation rates by both H2O2 and molecular oxygen. The concentration of H2O2 in rain has increased; hydrogen peroxide is the primary oxidant of inorganic Fe(II) in precipitation. The East Coast of the USA is also receiving less rain of terrestrial origin, which tends to be higher in dissolved iron and organic compounds. All these factors operate in the same direction and contribute to the lower concentrations and lack of stability of Fe(II) in rainwater currently observed. Results of this study suggest that wet deposition of soluble Fe(II) is an episodic, temporally variable factor in the iron cycle in oceanic regions adjacent to developed or developing coastal regions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Fossil fuel exhaust; Iron speciation; Marine iron cycle; Rainwater trends","Archer, C.L., Caldeira, K., Historical trends in the jet streams (2008) Geophys.

In this context, sorption-enhanced reforming (SE-SR) is a promising process that can be implemented as a CCS pre-combustion methodology. Regarding conventional catalyst-CO2 sorbent materials, main challenges concern the development of innovative CO2 sorbents with higher stability and regeneration temperature lower than CaO one. In recent study, a high-performance material based on incorporation of CaO particles into calcium aluminates was developed by authors exhibiting high sorption capacity and stability in multi cycle process. In this study, such a sorbent was packed, together with the catalyst, in a fixed bed reactor and tested in multi-cycle SE-SR process optimizing the operating conditions. Sensitivity analysis was carried out in reference to feeding flow rate, steam to carbon molar ratio and material particle size. The innovative sorbent exhibits, in optimized process, significant performance improvements (in terms of H2 purity and total CO2 amount adsorbed in each carbonation cycle) respect similar approaches available in the technical literature. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Calcium aluminates; CaO-based sorbent; CO2 capture; SE-SR","Barelli, L., Bidini, G., Gallorini, F., Servili, S., Hydrogen production through SE-SMR and membrane technology: a review (2008) Energy, 33, pp. 554-570; Barelli, L., Bidini, G., Corradetti, A., Desideri, U., Study of the carbonation-calcination reaction applied to the hydrogen production from syngas (2007) Energy, 32, pp. 697-710; Barelli, L., Bidini, G., Corradetti, A., Desideri, U., Production of hydrogen through the carbonation-calcination reaction applied to CH4/CO2 mixtures (2007) Energy, 32, pp. 834-843; Abanades, J.C., Alvarez, D., Conversion limits in the reaction with CO2 with lime (2003) Energy Fuels, 17, pp. 308-315; Blamey, J., Anthony, E.J., Wang, J., Fennell, P.S., The calcium looping cycle for large-scale CO2 capture (2010) Prog Energy Combust Sci, 36, pp. 260-279; MacDowell, N., Florin, N., Buchard, A., Hallett, J., Galindo, A., Jackson, G., An overview of CO2 capture technologies (2010) Energy Environ Sci, 3, pp. 1645-1669; Choi, S., Drese, J.H., Jones, C.W., Adsorbent materials for carbon dioxide capture from large anthropogenic point sources (2009) ChemSusChem, 2, pp. 796-854; Wang, Q., Luo, J., Zhong, Z., Borna, A., CO2 capture by solid adsorbents and their applications: current status and new trends (2011) Energy Environ Sci, 4, pp. 42-55; Drage, T.C., Snape, C.E., Stevens, L.A., Wood, J., Wang, J., Cooper, A.I., Materials challenges for the development of solid sorbents for post-combustion carbon capture (2012) J Mater Chem, 22, pp. 2815-2823; Ram Reddy, M.K., Xu, Z.P., Lu, G.Q., da Costa, J.C.D., Influence of water on high temperature CO2 capture using layered double hydroxide derivates (2008) Ind Eng Chem Res, 47, pp. 2630-2635; Hufton, J.R., Mayorga, S., Sircar, S., Sorption-enhanced reaction process for hydrogen production (1999) AIChE J, 45, pp. 248-256; Ebner, A.D., Reynolds, S.P., Ritter, J.A., Non-equilibrium kinetic model that describes the reversible adsorption and desorption behavior of CO2 in a K - promoted HTlc (2007) Ind Eng Chem Res, 46, pp. 1737-1744; Feng, B., Liu, W.Q., Li, X., An, H., Overcoming the problem of loss-in-capacity of calcium oxide in CO2 capture (2006) Energy Fuels, 20, pp. 2417-2420; Gruene, P., Belova, A.G., Yegulalp, T.M., Farrauto, R.J., Castaldi, M.J., Dispersed calcium oxides as a reversible and efficient CO2-sorbent at intermediate temperatures (2011) Ind Eng Chem Res, 50, pp. 4042-4049; Kierzkowska, A.M., Poulikakos, L.V., Broda, M., Müller, C.R., Synthesis of calcium-based, Al2O3-stabilized sorbents for CO2 capture using a co-precipitation technique (2013) Int J Greenhouse Gas Contr, 15, pp. 48-54; Liu, W.Q., Feng, B., Wu, Y.Q., Wang, G.X., Barry, J., Diniz Da Costa, J.C., Synthesis of sintering-resistant sorbents for CO2 capture (2010) Environ Sci Technol, 44, pp. 3093-3097; Li, Y.J., Zhao, C.S., Chen, H.C., Duan, L.B., Chen, X.P., Cyclic CO2 capture behavior of KMnO4 -doped CaO-based sorbent (2010) Fuel, 89, pp. 642-649; Wu, S.F., Zhu, Y.Q., Behavior of CaTiO3/nano-CaO as a CO2 reactive adsorbent (2010) Ind Eng Chem Res, 49, pp. 2701-2706; Li, Z.S., Cai, N.S., Huang, Y.Y., Han, H.J., Synthesis, experimental studies, and analysis of a new calcium-based carbon dioxide absorbent (2005) Energy Fuels, 19, pp. 1447-1452; Martavaltzi, C.S., Lemonidou, A.A., Development of new CaO based sorbent materials for CO2 removal at high temperature (2008) Micropor Mesopor Mater, 110, pp. 119-127; Martavaltzi, C.S., Lemonidou, A.A., Parametric study of the CaO-Ca12Al14O33 synthesis with respect to high CO2 sorption capacity and stability on multicycle operation (2008) Ind Eng Chem Res, 47, pp. 9537-9543; Zhou, Z.M., Qi, Y., Xie, M.M., Cheng, Z.M., Yuan, W.K., Synthesis of CaO-based sorbents through incorporation of alumina/aluminate and their CO2 capture performance (2012) Chem Eng Sci, 74, pp. 172-180; Xie, M., Zhou, Z., Qi, Y., Cheng, Z., Yuan, W., Sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming by in situ CO2 capture on a CaO-Ca9Al6O18 sorbent (2012) Chem Eng J, pp. 142-150; Sultana, K.S., Chen, D., Enhanced hydrogen production by in situ CO2 removal on CaCeZrOx nanocrystals (2011) Catal Today, 171, pp. 43-51; Barelli, L., Bidini, G., Di Michele, A., Gallorini, F., Petrillo, C., Sacchetti, F., Synthesis and test of innovative sorbents based on calcium aluminates for SE-SR (2014) Appl Energy, 127, pp. 81-92; Liu, W.Q., Low, N.W., Feng, B., Wang, G.X., Diniz Da Costa, J.C., Calcium precursors for the production of CaO sorbents for multi-cycle CO2 capture (2010) Environ Sci Technol, 44, pp. 841-847",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921442284

Therefore, increased attention has been paid to wind energy, one of the most promising sources of green energy in the world. Wind speed forecasting is of increasing importance because wind speeds affect power grid operation scheduling, wind power generation and wind farm planning. Many studies have been conducted to improve wind speed prediction performance. However, less work has been performed to preprocess the outliers existing in the raw wind speed data to achieve accurate forecasting. In this paper, Support Vector Regression (SVR), a learning machine technique for detecting outliers, has been successfully combined with seasonal index adjustment (SIA) and Elman recurrent neural network (ERNN) methods to construct the hybrid models named PMERNN and PAERNN. Then, this paper presents a medium-term wind speed forecasting performance analysis for three different sites in the Xinjiang region of China, utilizing daily wind speed data collected over a period of eight years. The experimental results suggest that the hybrid models forecast the daily wind velocities with a higher degree of accuracy over the prediction horizon compared to the other models. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Elman recurrent neural network; Hybrid model; Outlier detection; Support vector regression; Wind speed forecasting","Wu, J., Wang, J.Z., Chi, D.Z., Wind energy potential assessment for the site of inner Mongolia in China (2013) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 21, pp. 215-228; Shamshad, A., Bawadi, M.A., Wan Hussin, W.M.A., Majid, T.A., Sanusi, S.A.M., First and second order Markov chain models for synthetic generation of wind speed time series (2005) Energy, 30, pp. 693-708; Jiang, Y., Song, Z., Kusiak, A., Very short-term wind speed forecasting with Bayesian structural break model (2013) Renew Energy, 50, pp. 637-647; Haque, A.H., Mandal, P., Kaye, M.E., Meng, J.L., Chang, L.C., Senjyu, T., Anew strategy for predicting short-term wind speed using soft computing models (2012) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 16, pp. 4563-4573; Ackermann, T., Soder, L., Wind energy technology and current status: a review (2000) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 4, pp. 315-374; Guo, Z.H., Zhao, J., Zhang, W.Y., Wang, J.Z., Acorrected hybrid approach for wind speed prediction in hexi corridor of China (2011) Energy, 36, pp. 1668-1679; Abdel-Aal, R.E., Elhadidy, M.A., Shaahid, S.M., Modeling and forecasting the mean hourly wind speed time series using GMDH-based abductive networks (2009) Renew Energy, 34, pp. 1686-1699; Pourmousavi Kani, S.A., Aredhali, M.M., Very short-term wind speed prediction: a new artificial neural network-Markov chain model (2011) Energy Convers Manag, 52, pp. 738-745; Kariniotakis, G., Marti, I., Casas, D., Pinson, P., Nielsen, T.S., Madsen, H., What performance can be expected by short-term wind power prediction models depending on site characteristics?

Some of these changes might be related to excessive deposition of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N), but the relationship has not been quantified due to lack of monitoring data, particularly S and N deposition data. In this study, we investigated the concentrations, fluxes, and sources of S and N wet deposition in JNNR from April 2010 to May 2011. The results show that SO4 2-, NO3 -, and NH4 + concentrations in the wet deposition were 39.4-170.5, 6.2-34.8, and 0.2-61.2μeqL-1, with annual Volume-Weighted Mean (VWM) concentrations of 70.5, 12.7, and 13.4μeqL-1, respectively. Annual wet deposition fluxes of SO4 2-, NO3 -, and NH4 + were 8.06, 1.29, and 1.39kgS(N)ha-1, respectively, accounting for about 90% of annual atmospheric inputs of these species at the monitoring site. The results of Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis show that fossil fuel combustion, agriculture, and aged sea salt contributed to 99% and 83% of annual wet deposition fluxes of SO4 2- and NO3 -, respectively. Agriculture alone contributed to 89% of annual wet deposition flux of NH4 +. Although wet deposition in JNNR was polluted by anthropogenic acids, the acidity was largely neutralized by the Ca2+ from crust and 81% of wet deposition samples had a pH higher than 6.00. However, acid rain mainly caused by SO4 2- continued to occur in the wet season, when ambient alkaline dust concentration was lower. Since anthropogenic emissions have elevated S and N deposition and caused acid rain in JNNR, further studies are needed to better quantify the regional sources and ecological effects of S and N deposition for JNNR. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Acid rain; Ecological impacts; National Park; Regional air pollution; Tourism; World Natural Heritage Site","Bergström, A., Jansson, M., Atmospheric nitrogen deposition has caused nitrogen enrichment and eutrophication of lakes in the northern hemisphere (2006) Glob.

Because fossil fuels are the products of long-term photosynthesis, it is highly desirable to develop artificial photosynthetic systems for the production of renewable and clean energy such as hydrogen.

The industrial demand for vegetable oil will increase with the continued depletion of fossil fuels and ensuing environmental issues such as climate change, caused by increased carbon dioxide in the air. Some plants accumulate high levels of unusual fatty acids in their seeds, and these fatty acids (FAs) have properties that make them suitable for industrial applications. Hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs) are some of the most important of these industrial FAs. Castor oil is the conventional source of HFA. However, due to the presence of toxin ricin in its seeds, castor is not cultivated on a large scale. Lesquerella is another HFA accumulator and is currently being developed as a new crop for a safe source of HFAs. The mechanisms of HFA synthesis and accumulation have been extensively studied using castor genes and the model plant Arabidopsis. HFAs accumulated to 17 % in the seed oil of Arabidopsis expressing a FA hydroxylase gene from castor (RcFAH12), but its seed oil content and plant growth decreased. When RcFAH12 gene was coexpressed with additional castor gene(s) in Arabidopsis, ~30 % HFAs were accumulated and the seed oil content and plant growth was almost restored to the wild-type level. Further advancement of our understanding of pathways, genes and regulatory mechanisms underlying synthesis and accumulation of HFAs is essential to developing and implementing effective genetic approaches for enhancing HFA production in oilseeds.Key message: Hydroxy fatty acids produced in plant seed oil are important industrial material. This review focuses on the use of metabolic engineering approaches for the production of hydroxy fatty acids in transgenic plants. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Arabidopsis; Castor; Hydroxy fatty acid; Industrial fatty acid; Lesquerella; Transgenic oilseed crop","Amri, I.N., The Lauric (Coconut and Palm Kernel) Oils (2011) Vegetable oils in food technology: composition, properties and uses, pp. 169-198. , Gunstone FD, (ed), Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford:; Andre, C., Haslam, R.P., Shanklin, J., Feedback regulation of plastidic acetyl-CoA carboxylase by 18:1-acyl carrier protein in Brassica napus (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 109, pp. 10107-10112. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38XhtVOitLfK, PID: 22665812; Armougom, R., Grondin, I., Smadja, J., Fatty acid composition of lipid extracts of some tropical cucurbit seeds (1998) Ocl Ol Corps Gras Lipids, 5, pp. 323-328. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DyaK1cXnsVynsbw%3D; Arroyo-Caro, J.M., Chileh, T., Alonso, D.L., García-Maroto, F., Molecular characterization of a lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase gene belonging to the MBOAT family in Ricinus communis L (2013) Lipids, 48, pp. 663-674. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXot1KitL0%3D, PID: 23700249; Arroyo-Caro, J.M., Chileh, T., Kazachkov, M., Zou, J., Alonso, D.L., García-Maroto, F., The multigene family of lysophosphatidate acyltransferase (LPAT)-related enzymes in Ricinus communis.

Based on energy consumption features of the Chinese households at different income levels, this paper adopts an input-output price model to analyze possible impacts of removing energy subsidies on income distribution under different scenarios. Results show that: (1) The distributional impacts of removing subsidies vary by fossil fuels. From the perspectives of combined effects, transport fuel subsidy removal and coal subsidy removal have the strongest and the weakest progressive effects respectively, while the removal of electricity subsidies has a regressive effect. Moreover, the removal of petroleum product subsidies has the greatest impact on households, followed by the removal of electricity and coal subsidies, respectively. (2) Indirect impacts of energy subsidy reform are greater than direct impacts on households. (3) Government price controls can reduce the negative impact of energy subsidy reform. Policy implications are thus summarized. Energy subsidy reform can start from the energy that has the strongest progressive effect and the minimum impact on households. The Chinese government can take certain compensatory measures to mitigate the impact of reform on poor households. © 2015.","Distributional impact; Energy subsidies; Input-output price model","Ahmad, E., Stern, N., Effective carbon taxes and public policy options: Insights from India and Pakistan (2009) Asia Research Centre working paper no. 28, , London School of Economics and Political Science, London, UK; Andriamihaja, N.A., Vecchi, G., An evaluation of the welfare impact of higher energy prices in Madagascar (2007) Africa region working paper series no. 106, , http://www.worldbank.org/afr/wps/wp106.pdf, (Available at); Barnes, D.F., Plas, R.V.D., Floor, W., Tackling the rural energy problem in developing countries (1997) Finance & Development, 6, pp. 11-15; Clements, B., Jung, H.S., Gupta, S., Real and distributive effects of petroleum price liberalization: The case of Indonesia (2007) Developing Economies, 45 (2), pp. 220-237; Coady, D., Said, M., Gillingham, R., Kpodar, K., Medas, P.A., Newhouse, D.L., The magnitude and distribution of fuel subsidies: Evidence from Bolivia, Ghana, Jordan, Mali, and Sri Lanka (2006) IMF working paper no. 06/247; Coady, D., Gillingham, R., Ossowski, R., Piotrowski, J., Tareq, S., Tyson, J., Petroleum product subsidies: Costly, inequitable, and rising (2006) IMF staff position note no.

Existing methods to heat margarine have a high hourly cost of production and use fossil fuels which have been shown to have a negative impact on the environment. Thus, we perform an analytical feasibility study of using solar thermal power as an alternative energy source for the margarine melting process. In this study, the efficiency and cost effectiveness of a parabolic trough collector (PTC) solar field are compared with that of a steam boiler. Different working fluids (water vapor and Therminol-VP1 heat transfer oil (HTO)) through the solar field are also investigated. The results reveal the total hourly cost ($/h) by the conventional configuration is much greater than the solar applications regardless of the type of working fluid. Moreover, the conventional configuration causes a negative impact to the environment by increasing the amount of CO2, CO, and NO2 by 117.4 kg/day, 184 kg/day, and 74.7 kg/day, respectively. Optimized period of melt and tank volume parameters at temperature differences not exceeding 25 °C are found to be 8-10 h and 100 m3, respectively. The solar PTC operated with water and steam as the working fluid is recommended as a vital alternative for the margarine melting heating process.

Among the available technologies, the electrochemical valorisation of CO2 appears to be an innovative technology, in which electrical energy is supplied to establish a potential between two electrodes, allowing CO2 to be transformed into value-added chemicals under mild conditions. It provides a method to recycle CO2 (in a carbon neutral cycle) and, at the same time, a way to chemically store the excess of renewable energy from intermittent sources, thus reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Among the useful products that can be obtained, methanol is particularly interesting as a platform chemical, and it has gained renewed and growing attention in the research community. Accomplishments to date in the electroreduction of CO2 to methanol have been encouraging, although substantial advances are still needed for it to become a profitable technology able to shift society to renewable energy sources. This review presents a unified discussion of the significant work that has been published in the field of electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methanol. It emphasizes the aspects related to process design at different levels: cathode materials, reaction media, design of electrochemical cells, as well as working conditions. It then extends the discussion to the important conclusions from different electrocatalytic routes, and recommendations for future directions to develop a catalytic system that will convert CO2 to methanol at high process efficiencies.

The electrical feed-in from photovoltaic (PV) systems and wind energy converters (WEC) varies greatly both over short and long time periods (from minutes to seasons), and (not only) by this effect the supply of electrical power from RES and the demand for electrical power are not per se matching. In addition, with a growing share of generation capacity especially in distribution grids, the top-down paradigm of electricity distribution is gradually replaced by a bottom-up power supply. This altogether leads to new problems regarding the safe and reliable operation of power grids. In order to address these challenges, the notion of Smart Grids has been introduced. The inherent flexibilities, i.e. the set of feasible power schedules, of distributed power units have to be controlled in order to support demand-supply matching as well as stable grid operation. Controllable power units are e.g. combined heat and power plants, power storage systems such as batteries, and flexible power consumers such as heat pumps. By controlling the flexibilities of these units we are particularly able to optimize the local utilization of RES feed-in in a given power grid by integrating both supply and demand management measures with special respect to the electrical infrastructure. In this context, decentralized systems, autonomous agents and the concept of self-organizing systems will become key elements of the ICT based control of power units. In this contribution, we first show how a decentralized load management system for battery charging/discharging of electrical vehicles (EVs) can increase the locally used share of supply from PV systems in a low voltage grid. For a reliable demand side management of large sets of appliances, dynamic clustering of these appliances into uniformly controlled appliance sets is necessary. We introduce a method for self-organized clustering for this purpose and show how control of such clusters can affect load peaks in distribution grids. Subsequently, we give a short overview on how we are going to expand the idea of self-organized clusters of units into creating a virtual control center for dynamic virtual power plants (DVPP) offering products at a power market. For an efficient organization of DVPPs, the flexibilities of units have to be represented in a compact and easy to use manner. We give an introduction how the problem of representing a set of possibly 10100 feasible schedules can be solved by a machine-learning approach. In summary, this article provides an overall impression how we use agent based control techniques and methods of self-organization to support the further integration of distributed and renewable energy sources into power grids and energy markets. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Local demand-supply-matching in power grids; Self-organization; Smart grids; System integration of renewable energy; Virtual power plants","Asmus, P., Microgrids, virtual power plants and our distributed energy future (2010) Electr J, 23 (10), pp. 72-82; Awerbuch, S., Preston, A.M., The virtual utility: accounting, technology & competitive aspects of the emerging industry (1997) Topics in regulatory economics and policy, 26. , Kluwer Academic Publishers; Beer, S., Sonnenschein, M., Appelrath, H.-J., Towards a self-organisation mechanism for agent associations in electricity spot markets (2011) Informatik 2011 (Proceeding), , Springer Verlag, [LNCS GI-Edition]; Langfristszenarien und Strategien für den Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien in Deutschland bei Berücksichtigung der Entwicklung in Europa und global (2012) Bundesumweltministerium (BMU) (in German); Energiekonzept der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (2010) Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie (in German); Bremer, J., Sonnenschein, M., Kommunikation von Umweltkennzahlen im Smart Grid und deren Integration in die verteilte Wirkleistungsplanung (2013) 5.

Today, industrial hydrogen production mainly uses thermochemical processes based on fossil fuels or electrolysis of water. Therefore, biotechnological approaches to produce H2 from biomass are an interesting alternative. We introduce here a novel direct hydrogen measurement system using a semiconducting device specific for hydrogen detection. Using this device, a bacterium producing considerable amounts of hydrogen under aerobic cultivation was isolated and identified by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing as Citrobacter sp. The enzyme responsible for the observed hydrogenase activity was partially purified by 3 chromatographic purification steps and could be identified by peptide mass fingerprinting to be a type 2 [NiFe]-hydrogenase. Expression of the [NiFe]-hydrogenase 2 containing operon from Citrobacter sp. SG in Escherichia coli allowed recombinant hydrogen production. The [NiFe]-hydrogenase 2 identified here may be useful for biotechnological hydrogen production. We speculate that the expression of the hydrogenase in Citrobacter may be an adaptation to growth in acidic conditions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Citrobacter; Hydrogen measurement; Hydrogen production; Type 2 [NiFe]-hydrogenase","Abou Hamdan, A., Burlat, B., Gutiérrez-Sanz, O., Liebgott, P.-P., Baffert, C., De Lacey, A.L., Rousset, M., Dementin, S., O2-independent formation of the inactive states of NiFe hydrogenase (2013) Nat.

Electric Vehicle (EV) is one of the AFVs that deliver clear benefit of zero tailpipe emissions. The EVs have a limited range and their use is influenced by the location of recharging facilities. The charging time of EV is long and recharging in stations take a lot of time. In addition, the capacity of recharging stations is limited and if the capacity is occupied the vehicles must wait in queues. In this paper, a recharging station location model with queue is proposed which considers capacity, recharging time, and waiting time. The presented model is a set covering and can easily become a maximum cover model with or without predefined activities. A heuristic algorithm to solve the model is proposed and the model is evaluated using two networks under various conditions; a random generated and a network of Penghu County. The obtained results indicate that the model is able to identify the location and the number of the recharging stations and provide a good travel plan especially for tourism. © 2015 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","alternative fuel vehicle; recharging-station location; set covering; slow station",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925047950

However, cultivation and productivity of target algae need improvement, while controlling undesired organisms that can lower the efficiency of production systems. A central composite design and response surface model were utilized to predict cultivation optima of marine microalga, Nannochloropsis salina, under a suite of environmental parameters. The effects of salinity, pH, and temperature and their interactions were studied on maximum sustainable yield (MSY, a measure for biomass productivity), lipid content of N. salina, and invading organisms. Five different levels of each environmental predictor variable were tested. The environmental factors were kept within ranges that had previously been determined to allow positive N. salina growth (14.5–45.5 PSU; pH 6.3–9.7; 11–29 °C). The models created for this experiment showed that N. salina’s MSY and lipid content are not strongly affected over the broad range of salinity and temperature values. Calculated optima levels were 28 PSU/20 °C for MSY and 14.5 PSU/20 °C for lipid accumulation, but neither value significantly influenced the model. However, pH was the most important factor to influence algae productivity, and pH optimum was estimated around 8. Both MSY and lipid content were strongly reduced when pH deviated from the optimum. Occurrence of invading organisms seemed stochastic, and none of the environmental factors studied significantly influenced abundance. In conclusion, pH should be kept around 8 for maximum productivity of N. salina. Temperature and salinity should be kept around 20 °C and 28 PSU; however, moderate variations are not too much of a concern and might enhance lipid content of N. salina. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","Algae density; Biodiesel fuel; Environmental factors; Invasive organisms; Lipid productivity; Response surface model",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925637443

In this study we created a transposon library of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 in order to identify novel gene targets for enhanced fatty acid and hydrocarbon production. The transposon library was subsequently screened for desirable traits using macro- and microscopic observations as well as staining with the lipophilic dye Nile Red. Results: Based on the screening results, we selected a single mutant, which has an insertion in the gene encoding for the GTP-binding protein Era. We subsequently verified the phenotype-genotype relation by overexpression, reintroducing and complementing the mutation. Overexpression of era caused a reduction in the cell size in the late exponential phase of growth and an increase in the total amount of intracellular fatty acids. Reintroduction of the inactivated transposon caused a significant increase in the cellular length as well as changes in the amounts of individual hydrocarbons and fatty acids. Ectopic complementation of this mutation fully restored the hydrocarbon production profile to that of wild-type and partially restored the fatty acid production. Moreover, the cellular size was significantly smaller than that of the inactivated transposon mutant. Conclusions: The GTP-binding protein Era has never been studied in cyanobacteria and proved to be an essential gene for S. elongatus PCC 7942. We also found that this protein is important for hydrocarbon and fatty acid metabolism as well as determination of the cell size in PCC 7942. Our results suggest that the GTP-binding protein Era can be used as a novel target for further improvement of biofuel precursors production. © 2015 Voshol et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Biofuels; Cyanobacteria; Fatty acids; GTP-binding protein Era; Hydrocarbons; Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928143012

The usage of VFAs as carbon sources for lipid accumulation was investigated in batch cultures. Culture medium, culture temperature, and nitrogen sources were explored for lipid production in the heterotrophic cultivation. The concentration and the ratio of VFAs exhibited significant influence on cell growth and lipid accumulation. The highest lipid yield coefficient and lipid content of C. protothecoides grown on VFAs were 0.187 g/g and 48.7 %, respectively. The lipid content and fatty acids produced using VFAs as carbon sources were similar to those seen on growth and production using glucose. The techno-economic analysis indicates that the biodiesel derived from the lipids produced by heterotrophic C. protothecoides with VFAs as carbon sources is very promising and competitive with other biofuels and fossil fuels. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.","Chlorella protothecoides; Heterotrophic cultivation; Microbial lipids; Techno-economic analysis; Volatile fatty acids (VFAs)","Schneider, T., Graeff-Hönninger, S., French, W., Hernandez, R., Merkt, N., Claupein, W., Hetrick, M., Pham, P., Lipid and carotenoid production by oleaginous red yeas Rhodotorula glutinis cultivated on brewery effluents (2013) Energy, 61 (1), pp. 34-43. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXhsFKhur4%3D; Timilsina, G.R., Shrestha, A., How much hope should we have for biofuels?

Important differences are identified in emission trajectories of developed, emerging and developing regions, in both the baseline and the climate policy scenarios, due to differences in economic growth rates, energy and carbon intensity developments, and mitigation potentials. In the baseline, energy intensity developments vary strongly with economic growth assumptions, while fossil fuel availability has a particularly strong effect on carbon intensity developments which result in more region-specific sensitivity than do economic growth variations. On the other hand, the core findings associated to climate policy and regional mitigation strategies remain unaffected by this uncertainty. In all baseline scenarios China, the USA and India are the greatest emitters in terms of cumulated 21st century emissions, comprising almost 50 % of the global total. Differences in terms of per capita emissions between developed and developing countries persist under either baseline assumption, but are contracted under climate policy. Long-term per capita emissions remain above world average in China, India and Europe, reflecting their relatively smaller renewable resource potentials. The core regional technological implications of climate change mitigation are insensitive to economic growth and fossil fuel availability assumptions. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925276275

The aim of this study was to isolate a potential thermo-solvent tolerant cellulase producing bacterium from natural resources, and then applied for purification and characterization. The purified enzyme was to be accessible for the bioethanol production as well as industrial exploitation (discuss in our next study). Results: It is the first instance when thermo-solvent tolerant cellulase producing bacterium was isolated from soil sample. The culture was identified as Bacillus vallismortis RG-07 by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Bacillus vallismortis RG-07 reported maximum cellulase production from sugarcane baggase (4105 U ml-1) used as agro-waste carbon source. The cellulase enzyme produced by the Bacillus sp. was purified by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography, with overall recovery of 28.8%. The molecular weight of purified cellulase was 80 kDa as revealed by SDS-PAGE and activity gel analysis. The optimum temperature and pH for enzyme activity was determined as 65°C and 7.0 and it retained 95 and 75% of activity even at 95°C, and 9.0 respectively. The enzyme activity was enhanced in the presence of organic solvents (30%) n-dodecane, iso-octane, n-decane, xylene, toluene, n-haxane, n-butanol, and cyclohexane, after prolonged incubation (7 days). The enzyme activity was also stimulated by Ca2+, mercaptoethanol, Tween-60, and Sodium hypochloride whereas strongly inhibited by Hg. Kinetic analysis of purified enzyme showed the Km and Vmax to be 1.923 mg ml-1 and 769.230 μg ml-1 min-1, respectively. Conclusion: The unique property of solvent-thermostable-alkalophilic, nature proves the potential candidature of this isolate for current mainstream biomass conversion into fuel and other industrial process. © 2015 Gaur and Tiwari.","16S rDNA; Bacillus vallismortis; Heavy metal; Solvent tolerant; Thermotolerant","Bhat, M.K., Bhat, S., Cellulose degrading enzymes and their potential industrial applications (1997) Biotechnol Adva, 15, pp. 583-620; Costa, R.B., Silva, M.V.A., Freitas, F.C., Leitao, V.S.F., Lacerda, P.S.B., Ferrara, M.A., Mercado e Perspectivas de Uso de Enzimas Industriais e Especiais no Brasil (2008) Enzimas em Biotecnologia, Producao, Aplicac oes e Mercados. 1st ed.

Its effect is now considered to be irreversible and this could lead to the demise of human society. This is a complex issue without a single solution, yet from the burgeoning global research activity and development in the field of CO2 capture and utilization, there is light at the end of the tunnel. In this article a couple of recent advances are illuminated. Attention is focused on the discovery of gas-phase, light-assisted heterogeneous catalytic materials and processes for CO2 photoreduction that operate at sufficiently high rates and conversion efficiencies, and under mild conditions, to open a new pathway for an energy transition from today's ""fossil fuel economy"" to a new and sustainable ""CO2 economy"". Whichever of the competing CO2 capture and utilization approaches proves to be the best way forward for the development of a future CO2-based solar fuels economy, hopefully this can occur in a period short enough to circumvent the predicted adverse consequences of greenhouse gas climate change. © 2015 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Certain compounds that undergo light-induced isomerisation to a metastable isomer can be used for storage of solar energy, so-called molecular solar thermal systems. Exposing the compound to sun light will generate a high energy photoisomer that can be stored. When energy is needed, the photoisomer can be catalytically converted back to the parent compound, releasing the excess energy as heat. This Letter gives examples of selected molecular solar thermal systems found in the literature. The focus of the Letter is on examples where molecular design has been used to improve the performance of the molecules, and as such it may serve as an inspiration for future design. The selected examples cover five widely studied systems, notably: anthracenes, stilbenes, azobenzenes, tetracarbonyl-fulvalene-diruthenium compounds and norbornadienes. © 2015 The Authors.

In this context, carbon capture from thermal power plants and the energy penalty incurred in the process are important issues. The present work reports on a detailed analysis of gas-fired power plant layouts with in-built carbon capture, i.e. the flue gas from these power plants contains mainly carbon dioxide and water vapour. Four layouts, two of which are based on pressurized oxyfuel combustion and two on chemical looping combustion (CLC), have been considered. Based on detailed mass balance, energy and thermodynamic analyses of the power plant layouts, the net efficiencies for each plant have been computed. After accounting for thermodynamic irreversibilities and CO2 compression to 110 bar, these have been found to vary between 31 and 52 % for the four plants. Despite the technological maturity of oxyfuel combustion, it is concluded that CLC-based plants would be future-ready in the sense that they can readily accommodate CCS with only 2 % loss in overall thermal efficiency for CO2 capture. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Carbon capture; Chemical looping combustion; Combined cycle power plant; First law analysis; Fossil fuels; Oxyfuel combustion",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924678424

The present work aims to study the changes in the flame characteristics and combustor performance in a cylindrical spray combustor when operated with kerosene and kerosene-ethanol blends. A laboratory scale combustor with two concentric air entries along with a centrally fitted pressure swirl nozzle is used in the experiments. Three different fuels, viz. kerosene and two blends of ethanol (5% and 10% by volume) with kerosene have been used. Flame images are captured using a high speed camera and analyzed for characterizing the flame behavior with different fuels. Temperatures of the combustor wall and exit gas have been measured by thermocouples while, the concentrations of CO, CO2 and O2 in the exhaust gas are recorded using an online gas analyzer. The brightness of the flame and combustor wall temperature are found to decrease considerably with 5% ethanol in the blend, although a further increase of ethanol (to 10%) decreases them marginally. However, the exit gas temperature reduces consistently with the addition of ethanol with kerosene. The standard deviation of brightness data is also much lower with the ethanol blended fuels. Flicker frequency of the flames, however, remains almost unchanged with the blending of ethanol in kerosene. The concentrations of the three species are found to be radially uniform at the exhaust indicating good mixing in the combustor. The CO concentration in the exhaust reduces with blending, indicating better combustion of the fuel. The CO2 concentration simultaneously decreases with ethanol blending representing less carbon loading to the atmosphere. The reduction in carbon compounds at the combustor exit due to blending of ethanol is attributed to the lower C/H ratio of ethanol compared to kerosene. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Combustor performance; Ethanol; Flame imaging; Flicker frequency; Kerosene","Lefebvre, A.H., Ballal, D.R., (2010) Gas Turbine Combustion: Alternative Fuels and Emissions, , Taylor & Francis Group; Blakey, S., Rye, L., Wilson, C.W., Aviation gas turbine alternative fuels: A review (2011) Proc Combust Inst, 33, pp. 2863-2885; Kallio, P., Paesztor, A., Akhtar, M.K., Jones, P.P., Renewable jet fuels (2014) Curr Opin Biotechnol, 26, pp. 50-55; Banhawy, Y.E., Whitelaw, J.H., Experimental study of the interaction between a fuel spray and surrounding combustion air (1981) Combust Flame, 42, pp. 253-275; Jones, W.P., Toral, H., Temperature and composition measurement in a research gas-turbine combustion chamber (1983) Combust Sci Technol, 31, pp. 249-275; Heitor, M.V., Whitelaw, J.H., Velocity, temperature and species characteristics of the flow in a gas turbine combustor (1986) Combust Flame, 64, pp. 1-32; Bicen, A.F., Senda, M., Whitelaw, J.H., Scalar characteristics of combusting flow in a model annular combustor (1989) ASME J Eng Gas Turb Power, 111, pp. 90-96; Cameron, C.D., Brouwer, J., Wood, C.P., Samuelson, G.S., A detailed characterization of the velocity and thermal fields in a model can combustor with wall jet injection (1989) ASME J Eng Gas Turb Power, 111, pp. 31-35; Lefebvre, A.H., Fuel effects on gas turbine combustion-ignition, stability and combustion efficiency (1985) J Eng Gas Turbines Power, 107 (1), pp. 24-37; Odgers, J., Kretschmer, D., Pearce, G.F., The combustion of droplets within gas turbine combustors: Some recent observations on combustion efficiency (1993) J Eng Gas Turbines Power, 115 (3), pp. 522-532; Datta, A., Som, S.K., Combustion and emission characteristics in a gas turbine combustor at different pressure and swirl conditions (1999) Appl Therm Eng, 19, pp. 949-967; Burguburu, J., Cabot, G., Renou, B., Boukhalfa, A.M., Cazalens, M., Effects of H2 enrichment on flame stability and pollutant emissions for a kerosene/air swirled flame with an aeronautical fuel injector (2011) Proc Combust Inst, 33, pp. 2927-2935; Yoon, J., Kim, M.K., Hwang, J., Lee, J., Yoon, Y., Effect of fuel-air mixture velocity on combustion instability of a model gas turbine combustor (2013) Appl Therm Eng, 54 (1), pp. 92-101; Ronghou, L., Nan, L., Qingyu, L., Shuzhi, L., Anlin, G., Alcohol and cotton oil as alternative fuels for internal combustion engines (1994) Integrated Energy Systems in China: The Cold Northeastern Region Experience, pp. 111-151. , Nan L, Best G, Carvalho Neto CCde, editors Rome, Italy: FAO; Asfar, K.R., Hamed, H., Combustion of fuel blends (1998) Energy Convers Manage, 39 (10), pp. 1081-1093; Sequera, D., Agrawal, A.K., Spear, S.K., Daly, D.T., Combustion performance of liquid biofuels in a swirl-stabilized burner (2008) J Eng Gas Turbines Power, 130, pp. 032810-32818; Mendez, C.J., Parthasarathy, R.N., Gollahalli, S.R., Performance and emission characteristics of a small scale gas turbine engine fueled with ethanol/Jet A blends (2012) 50th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, , AIAA, Nashville, Tennessee Paper No. AIAA 2012-0522; Mendez, C.J., Parthasarathy, R.N., Gollahalli, S.R., Performance and emission characteristics of butanol/Jet A blends in a gas turbine engine (2014) Appl Energy, 118, pp. 135-140; Khalil, A.E.E., Gupta, A.K., Fuel flexible distributed combustion for efficient and clean gas turbine engines (2013) Appl Energy, 109, pp. 267-274; Chiariello, F., Allouis, C., Reale, F., Massoli, P., Gaseous and particulate emissions of a micro gas turbine fueled by straight vegetable oil-kerosene blends (2014) Exp Thermal Fluid Sci, 56, pp. 16-22; Yan, Y., Lu, G., Colechin, M., Monitoring and characterization of pulverized coal flames using digital imaging techniques (2002) Fuel, 81, pp. 647-656; Lu, G., Yan, Y., Colechin, M., A digital imaging based multifunctional flame monitoring system (2004) IEEE Trans Instrum Meas, 53 (4); Sun, D., Lu, G., Zhou, H., Yan, Y., Flame stability monitoring and characterization through digital imaging and spectral analysis (2011) Meas Sci Technol, 22, pp. 114007-114015; Cencerrado, A.G., Pena, B., Gil, A., Coal flame characterization by means of digital image processing in a semi-industrial scale PF swirl burner (2012) Appl Energy, 94, pp. 375-384; Huang, Y., Yan, Y., Lu, G., Reed, A., On-line flicker measurement of gaseous flames by image processing and spectral analysis (1999) Meas Sci Technol, 10, pp. 726-733; Wen, Z., Yun, S., Thomson, M.J., Lightstone, M.F., Modeling soot formation in turbulent kerosene/air jet diffusion flame (2003) Combust Flame, 135, pp. 323-340; Canakci, M., Ozsezen, A.N., Alptekin, E., Eyidogan, M., Impact of alcohol-gasoline fuel blends on the exhaust emission of an SI engine (2013) Renew Energy, 52, pp. 111-117",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920283720

Biodiesel is one of the most readily implemented and low cost, alternative source of transportation fuels to meet future societal demands. However, current practises to produce biodiesel via transesterification employing homogeneous acids and bases result in costly fuel purification processes and undesired pollution. Life-cycle calculations on biodiesel synthesis from soybean feedstock show that the single most energy intensive step is the catalytic conversion of TAGs into biodiesel, accounting for 87% of the total primary energy input, which largely arises from the quench and separation steps. The development of solid acid and base catalysts that respectively remove undesired free fatty acid (FFA) impurities, and transform naturally occurring triglycerides found within plant oils into clean biodiesel would be desirable to improve process efficiency. However, the microporous nature of many conventional catalysts limits their ability to convert bulky and viscous feeds typical of plant or algal oils. Here we describe how improved catalyst performance, and overall process efficiency can result from a combination of new synthetic materials based upon templated solid acids and bases with hierarchical structures, tailored surface properties and use of intensified process allowing continuous operation. ©2014 Elsevier B.V.

The abatement capacity of major, minor, and trace elements and the fate of trace pollutants during wet limestone FGD, as well as the features of wet limestone FGD by-products are discussed. It can be stated that wet limestone FGD system is the FGD process most widely used because of its high desulphurisation performance and low operating cost. Among control parameters evaluated in this review, pH range &gt; limestone reactivity and SO2 concentration &gt; efficiency of particulate control devices &gt; water re-circulation to the scrubber &gt; entrainment of particles by the OUT-FGD gas, are the key factors of wet limestone FGDs. It is noted that, the enrichment of inorganic trace pollutants in FGD waters because of the re-circulation of water to the scrubber from gypsum slurry filtration, and the entrainment of accumulated fly ash particles in gypsum sludge, those of unreacted limestone, and the particles and droplets from gypsum slurry by the outgoing FGD (OUT-FGD) gas reduce considerably the desulphurisation efficiency and the abatement capacity of trace pollutants by wet limestone FGDs. The paper concludes with a number of issues to be investigated in depth in view of the worldwide FGD market growth and the forthcoming implementation of one of the most promising technologies to reduce CO2 emissions, oxy-fuel combustion, in Pulverised Coal Combustion (PCC)-FGD processes at an industrial scale. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Naval reactors have some differences from stationary PWR because they have limitations on volume and weight, requiring compact solutions. On the other hand, a source of problems in naval reactors across history is the steam generation function. In order to reduce nuclear containment footprint, it is desirable to employ integral designs, which, however, poses complications and design constraints for recirculation type steam generators, being interesting to employ once through steam generators, whose historic at Babcock & Wilcox is better than recirculation steam generators. Plate and shell heat exchangers are a mature technology made available by many suppliers which allows heat exchange at high temperature and pressure. This work investigates the feasibility of the use of an array of welded plate heat exchangers of a material approved by ASME for pressure barrier (Ti-3Al-2.5V) in a hypothetical naval reactor. It was found it is feasible from thermal-hydraulic point of view and presents advantages over other steam generator designs. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Maize cobs have beneficial characteristics for utilization as feedstock including compact tissue, high cellulose content, and low ash and nitrogen content. Nitrogen is quantitatively the most important nutrient for plant growth. However, the influence of nitrogen fertilization on maize cob production is unclear. In this study, quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been analyzed for cob morphological traits such as cob weight, volume, length, diameter and cob tissue density, and grain yield under normal and low nitrogen regimes. 213 doubled-haploid lines of the intermated B73 × Mo17 (IBM) Syn10 population have been resequenced for 8575 bins, based on SNP markers. A total of 138 QTL were found for six traits across six trials using composite interval mapping with ten cofactors and empirical comparison-wise thresholds (P = 0.001). Despite moderate to high repeatabilities across trials, few QTL were consistent across trials and overall levels of explained phenotypic variance were lower than expected some of the cob trait × trial combinations (R2 = 7.3–43.1 %). Variation for cob traits was less affected by nitrogen conditions than by grain yield. Thus, the economics of cob usage under low nitrogen regimes is promising. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924588548

Biodesulfurization and biodenitrogenation are processes which remove those pollutants through the action of microorganisms. The ability of sulfur and nitrogen removal by the strain Rhodococcus erythropolis ATCC 4277 was tested in a biphasic system containing different heavy gas oil concentrations in a batch reactor. Heavy gas oil is an important fraction of petroleum, because after passing through, the vacuum distillation is incorporated into diesel oil. This strain was able to remove about 40 % of the nitrogen and sulfur present in the gas heavy oil. Additionally, no growth inhibition occurred even when in the presence of pure heavy gas oil. Results present in this work are considered relevant for the development of biocatalytic processes for nitrogen and sulfur removal toward building feasible industrial applications. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Denitrogenation; Desulfurization; Heavy gas oil; Rhodococcus erythropolis",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924388490

On a global scale, the intensive use of this energy source has resulted in highly detrimental effects to the environment. Hydrogen production by water splitting, with sunlight as the main energy source, is a promising way to augment the production of renewable energy; however, the development of an efficient and stable water-oxidizing catalyst remains a key task before a technological breakthrough based on water splitting can be realized. A main issue hampering the development of commercially viable, non-precious-metal-based catalysts is their susceptibility to degradation. To efficiently address this major drawback, self-healing catalysts that can repair their structure without human intervention will be necessary. In this review, we focus on water oxidation by natural and artificial Mn-, Co-, and Ni-based catalysts and then discuss the self-healing properties that contribute to sustaining their catalytic activity. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","cobalt; manganese; nickel; photosystem II; self-healing catalysts; water oxidation catalysts","Barber, J., (2009) Chem.

The results indicated that the rain in this region was seriously acidized, 60% of the rain events' pH were lower than 5.0. SO4 2- and NO3 - were the main anions, and their volume weighted mean (VWM) values were 161.9μeq/L and 65.2μeq/L, respectively, which accounted for 71%-99% of the total measured anions. Ca2+ and NH4 + were the major cations with VWM values of 108.3μeq/L and 88.4μeq/L. Sum of Ca2+ and NH4 + accounted for 25%-94% of the total cations. Analysis of the seasonal variations of the pH showed that the rainwater was more acidized in summer than in the other seasons. Investigations of neutralization factors (NFs) indicated that the acidity of rainwater in winter and spring was neutralized by NH4 + and Ca2+. Studies of the origins of major ions showed that SO4 2- and NO3 - were from coal combustion and fossil fuels, and Na+ and Cl- were from sea sources, while Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+ were from the continental sources. The δ34S values of SO4 2- in rainwater ranged from -2.1‰ to 6.1‰ (mean value of 2.1‰). The δ34S values of SO4 2- in winter were much higher than those in other seasons. Analysis of the δ34S values vs. SO4 2- of rainwater combined with air mass trajectory showed that atmospheric sulfur at TGR was mainly associated with coal combustion and fossil fuels. The lower δ34S values in summer at TGR could be explained by higher contribution of biogenic sulfur. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Acid rain; Major ions; Sulfur isotope; Three gorges reservoir","Aas, W., Shao, M., Jin, L., Larssen, T., Zhao, D., Xiang, R., Zhang, J., Duan, L., Air concentrations and wet deposition of major inorganic ions at five non-urban sites in China, 2001-2003 (2007) Atmos.

The topic is addressed by identifying the most significant objectives, targets and issues, as well as the optimization formulations, schemes and models available in the published literature.The current energy demand combined with depletion of fossil-fuel reserves and stricter environmental regulations have led to the development of alternative renewable energy solutions like wind energy. The current 2030 United States target is to have at least 20% of the US energy supply by onshore and offshore wind farms. To meet these demands, wind energy costs have to be able to compete with traditional fossil fuel sources. Hence, it is essential and vital that wind turbine designers and manufactures search the optimal solution that fits the objectives under a set of design constraints. Throughout the last 30. years, the objective function has evolved from the earlier maximized metric of the power coefficient to the maximization of the annual energy production. Common alternatives such as blade mass minimization and maximization of the rotor thrust and torque have been examined. However, the main objective has been focused on the minimization of the cost of energy in order for wind energy to become more competitive and economically attractive.The purpose of this paper is to review previous work that undertakes the performance optimization of horizontal wind turbines by highlighting the main aspects when tackling the wind turbine optimization problem such as: objective functions, design constraints, tools and models and optimization algorithms. In addition, in a conclusion of the review, a discussion and argument about the challenges, issues and future developments are identified. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Algorithms; Optimization; Performance; Renewable energy; Simulation tools; Wind turbine","Grujicic, M., Arakere, G., Pandurangan, B., Sellappan, V., Vallejo, A., Ozen, M., Multidisciplinary design optimization for glass-fiber epoxy-matrix composite 5 MW horizontal-axis wind-turbine blades (2010) J Mater Eng Perform, 19, pp. 1116-1127; Bazmi, A.A., Zahedi, G., Sustainable energy systems: role of optimization modeling techniques in power generation and supply-a review (2011) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 15, pp. 3480-3500; Evans, A., Strezov, V., Evans, T.J., Assessment of sustainability indicators for renewable energy technologies (2009) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 13, pp. 1082-1088; Lindenberg, S., Smith, B., O'Dell, K., 20% wind energy by 2030.

To make a meaningful reduction in fossil fuel use, bioethanol must be produced from the entire plant rather than only its starch or sugars. Enzymes produced by fungi constitute a significant percentage of the cost of bioethanol production from non-starch (i.e., lignocellulosic) components of energy crops and agricultural residues. We, and others, have reasoned that fungi that naturally deconstruct plant walls may provide the best enzymes for bioconversion of energy crops. Results: Previously, we have reported on the isolation of 106 fungi from decaying leaves of Miscanthus and sugarcane (Appl Environ Microbiol 77:5490-504, 2011). Here, we thoroughly analyze 30 of these fungi including those most often found on decaying leaves and stems of these plants, as well as four fungi chosen because they are well-studied for their plant cell wall deconstructing enzymes, for wood decay, or for genetic regulation of plant cell wall deconstruction. We extend our analysis to assess not only their ability over an 8-week period to bioconvert Miscanthus cell walls but also their ability to secrete total protein, to secrete enzymes with the activities of xylanases, exocellulases, endocellulases, and beta-glucosidases, and to remove specific parts of Miscanthus cell walls, that is, glucan, xylan, arabinan, and lignin. Conclusion: This study of fungi that bioconvert energy crops is significant because 30 fungi were studied, because the fungi were isolated from decaying energy grasses, because enzyme activity and removal of plant cell wall components were recorded in addition to biomass conversion, and because the study period was 2 months. Each of these factors make our study the most thorough to date, and we discovered fungi that are significantly superior on all counts to the most widely used, industrial bioconversion fungus, Trichoderma reesei. Many of the best fungi that we found are in taxonomic groups that have not been exploited for industrial bioconversion and the cultures are available from the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures in Utrecht, Netherlands, for all to use. © 2015 Shrestha et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Bioconversion; Biofuel; Cellulose and hemicellulose degrading enzymes; Fungi; Lignocellulose",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928712800

Oil sands are a combination of clay, sand, water and bitumen. Vast quantities of oil sands resources have been found worldwide. The largest known reservoir of oil sands in the world is located in the province of Alberta (Canada). Several techniques for the extraction of the oil from oil sands have been developed in recent decades. Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is the most promising approach for recovering heavy and viscous oil resources. In SAGD, two closely-spaced horizontal wells, one above the other, form a steam-injector and producer pair. The reservoir oil is heated by the injected steam and drains to the producer under the effect of gravity. First aim of this work is an economic optimization and evaluation of an hypothetical industrial scale facility (named LINK), located in Alberta. All data relating to LINK plant have been obtained from a review of the existing literature references or have been assumed. A Discounted Cash Flow Analysis (DCFA) of LINK plant has been performed. Costs of existing projects have been found in literature. The results show that the hypothetical plant LINK is a profitable investment and that the investment cost has a significant effect on the competitiveness of the LINK facility. Second purpose of the present work is an environmental analysis of the LINK plant: in order to evaluate GHG emissions from LINK plant, a LCA analysis has been carried out. The calculated emissions from oil sand production by SAGD technology have been compared with values relating to conventional crude oil pathways and to recovery and extraction of bitumen through surface mining from literature. The comparison demonstrated that SAGD is a promising technology also from an environmental point of view. An economic-environmental model for SAGD technology optimization has been developed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Discounted Cash Flow Analysis; Life cycle assessment; Oil sands; SAGD","(2001) World Energy Outlook 2001: assessing today's supplies to fuel tomorrow's growth; (2013), Workshop ""Alberta, Canada: Tecnologie innovative per la produttività e la riduzione dell'impatto ambientale nelle risorse petrolifere non convenzionali"".

The aim of the current research was to identify the major environmental, economic and social impacts arising from the production of aviation biofuels in Brazil. Despite the great potential of these fuels, there is a significant need for improved routes of production and specifically for lower production costs of these materials. In addition, the productive chains of raw materials for obtaining these bioenergetics can be linked to environmental impacts by NOx emissions, extensive use of agricultural land, loss of wildlife and intensive water use, as well as economic, social and political impacts. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,"Kohler, J., Walz, R., Marscheder-Weidemann, F., Thedieck, B., Lead markets in 2nd generation biofuels for aviation: a comparison of Germany, Brazil and the USA (2014) Environ Innovation Soc Trans, 10, pp. 59-76; Jung, A., Dörrenberg, P., Rauch, A., Thöne, M., (2010) Biofuels - at what cost?

This methodology normalizes natural and economic inputs to permit a more holistic evaluation of systems. Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) is commonly not included in analyses of traditionally-designed ecosystems, or past evaluation has tended toward a qualitative valuation of TEK. Our research evaluated the emergy in the creation, maintenance, and transfer of TEK at the individual and community levels, as well as the biophysical and cultural resources that support this knowledge system. These evaluations took place within the Lacandon Maya village of Lacanja Chansayab, Mexico and with Zapotec farmers of Lalopa, Mexico. Respondents stressed the importance of inter-generational ties, the local forest, and community in their education. We found that TEK-based labor transformities (1.23E07 sej/J in Lacanja Chansayab, Mexico and 6.54E06 sej/J in Lalopa, Mexico) are similar to past qualitative estimates. TEK labor will result in minimal impact to the environment (i.e., environmental loading ratio) relative to Western education, which has comparable transformities, due to reliance on renewable local ecosystem inputs rather than fossil fuels and physical infrastructure. This research highlights the importance for sustainability of both preserving knowledge transfer systems resulting in TEK and in developing hands-on educational systems that rely upon the natural world as the primary classroom. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Indigenous; Lacandon; Sustainability; TEK; Zapotec","Abel, T., Human transformities in a global hierarchy: emergy and scale in the production of people and culture (2010) Ecol.

Lifecycle energy requirements are calculated and subsequently used for calculating three EROI variants. EROI1 is defined as the ratio of energy in fuel output to lifecycle (direct and indirect) fossil fuel energy inputs, excluding the energy content of fossil feedstock that ends up in the produced fuel. EROI2 is defined as the ratio of energy in fuel output to total fossil fuel energy inputs, including the energy content of fossil feedstock that ends up in the produced fuel. EROI3 is defined as the ratio of energy in fuel output to lifecycle (direct and indirect) fossil and non-fossil energy inputs, excluding the energy content of fossil and non-fossil feedstock that ends up in the produced fuel. We also define an approximation for EROI1 using lifecycle CO2 emissions. This approach agrees to within 20% of the actual EROI1 and can be used as an alternative when necessary. The feedstock-to-fuel pathways considered include conventional jet fuel from crude oil; Fischer-Tropsch jet (FT-J) fuel from natural gas (NG), coal and/or switchgrass; hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids jet (HEFA-J) fuel from soybean, palm, rapeseed and jatropha; and advanced fermentation jet (AF-J) fuel from sugarcane, corn grain and switchgrass. We find that EROI1 for jet fuel from conventional crude oil ranges between 4.9 and 14.0. Among the alternative fuel pathways considered, FT-J fuel from switchgrass has the highest baseline EROI1 of 9.8, followed by AF-J fuel from sugarcane at 6.7. HEFA-J fuel from oily feedstocks has an EROI1 between 1.6 (rapeseed) and 2.9 (palm). EROI2 differs from EROI1 only in the case of fossil-based jet fuels. Conventional jet from crude oil has a baseline EROI2 of 0.9, and FT-J fuel from NG and coal have values of 0.6 and 0.5, respectively. EROI3 values are on average 36% less than EROI1 for HEFA-J pathways. EROI3 for the AF-J and FT-J fuels considered is 50% less than EROI1 on average.

However, the use of non-woody biomass is facing challenges due to variability regarding chemical composition and fuel properties that may induce problems during combustion such as particulate matter (PM). The aim of this work was to measure and compare total PM concentrations during on-farm combustion of wood and four agricultural crops: short-rotation willow, switchgrass, miscanthus and reed canary grass. In order to study the influence of physicochemical properties, different shapes (pellets, chips and chopped grasses) and harvest seasons (fall and spring) were also evaluated. In this context, a representative small-scale (29kW), multi-fuel boiler for light commercial use was utilized. The boiler was also non-catalytic so that the burning took place in a single combustion chamber. Overall, twelve different biomass fuels were tested and each product was burned three times. Mean PM concentration of wood (416mgNm-3 at 7vol% O2) was lower than that of the four dedicated energy crops (505-1417mgNm-3 at 7vol% O2). However, because of the high variability between the experiments, no statistical significance was observed at P&gt;0.1 level except in one case. The PM amounts were high compared to literature data and Quebec's environmental regulation mainly because of the boiler system used. Except for willow, pelletized products decreased PM levels by 22-52% compared to chopped materials. Bulky biomass of low density was unable to reach steady-state conditions and produced compounds associated with incomplete combustion including PM. Spring-harvested biomass fuels showed a PM reduction up to 48% compared to fall-harvested crops. This was likely due to a 20-60% decrease of several chemical elements in the biomass, namely S, Cl, K and P which are the main constituents of fly ash. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Agricultural biomass; Combustion; Energy crops; Particulate matter; Physicochemical properties","(2007) E1757-01: Standard Practice for Preparation of Biomass for Compositional Analysis, pp. 1-4; (2007) E1755-01: Standard Test Method for Ash in Biomass, pp. 1-3; (2004) E711-87: Standard Test Method for Gross Calorific Value of Refused-Derived Fuel by the Bomb Calorimeter, pp. 1-8; (2012) Résultats du projet green pellets, , http://www.aile.asso.fr/cultures-energetiques/GreenPellets/colloque-final-green-pellets, Available at:, (accessed 09.01.13.); Brassard, P., Palacios, J.H., Godbout, S., Bussières, D., Lagacé, R., Larouche, J.P., Pelletier, F., Comparison of the gaseous and particulate matter emissions from the combustion of agricultural and forest biomasses (2014) Bioresour.

This research examines the impact of high dependence of imported fuels for power generation in Spain through the quantification and analysis of the driving forces behind the change in its electricity bill. Following logarithmic mean Divisia indexes approach, we present and perform a new method that enables a complete decomposition of changes in electricity vulnerability into contributions from several drivers. In fact, we identify five predefined factors behind the variations in vulnerability in Spain during the 1998-2011 period: fuel price, average heat rate, fuel dependence, degree of electricity importance and energy intensity. The application of this approach reveals a significant increase in Spanish vulnerability in the last two decades, promoted by increments in fuel price and importance of electricity over the primary energy consumption, but especially by increasing fuel dependence (particularly gas dependence). Therefore, findings mainly advocate for those strategies aimed at reducing Spanish energy dependence. Also those improving thermal efficiency and energy intensity are indicated. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Isolation of black carbon (BC) yields a mixture of diagenetic fossil C and pyrogenic BC from biomass and fossil fuel combustion. We investigated the degree to which fossil fuel combustion emissions have contributed to SOC and BC and how deposition dynamics have changed in the last century. As only biomass-derived BC contains 14C, we determined the content and 14C signature of the benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) fraction as the product of total BC oxidation. From an isotopic mass balance model, the proportion of fossil BC deposition and its contribution to SOC was calculated. Soil samples were taken from 1958-2002 from a long term agricultural field experiment in Halle, Germany; the area represents one of the most productive lignite mining areas in the world. Between 1958 and 1971, total BC content increased significantly (1.9±0.1-2.30±0.06g/kg soil), and the BC-specific radiocarbon content decreased from 29.6±0.4 to 26.9±0.2pMC, corresponding to 1.35±0.07 and 1.8±0.08g/kg BC from diagenetic C and fossil fuel combustion (denoted here as fossil BC). We infer an increase in fossil BC content of 30% within this timespan, with a net input rate of 9g/m2yr. In the 1970s, after railway electrification, reduction of lignite mining and related heavy industries, fossil BC deposition to soil was no longer significant. Overall, about 120g/m2 fossil BC was deposited between 1958-1971, with 390g/m2 before 1958. Fossil BC contributed ca. 75% of total BC and 15% SOC to arable soil, without any significant change in the following 30yr (1971-2002). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Benzene polycarboxylic acids; Black carbon; Coal combustion; Fossil fuel; Radiocarbon assessment","Bond, T.C., Bhardwaj, E., Dong, R., Jogani, R., Jung, S., Roden, C., Streets, D.G., Trautmann, N.M., Historical emissions of black and organic carbon aerosol from energy-related combustion, 1850-2000 (2007) Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 21, p. 16. , GB2018; Brodowski, S., Rodionov, A., Haumaier, L., Glaser, B., Amelung, W., Revised black carbon assessment using benzene polycarboxylic acids (2005) Organic Geochemistry, 36, pp. 1299-1310; Brodowski, S., Amelung, W., Haumaier, L., Zech, W., Black carbon contribution to stable humus in German arable soils (2007) Geoderma, 139, pp. 220-228; Chen, B., Andersson, A., Lee, M., Kirillova, E.N., Xiao, Q., Krusa, M., Shi, M., Gustafsson, Ö., Source forensics of black carbon aerosols from China (2013) Environmental Science & Technology, 47, pp. 9102-9108; Currie, L.A., Benner, B.A., Kessler, J.D., Klinedinst, D.B., Klouda, G.A., Marolf, J.V., Slater, J.F., Schmid, H., A critical evaluation of interlaboratory data on total, elemental, and isotopic carbon in the carbonaceous particle reference material, NIST SRM 1649a (2002) Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, 107, pp. 279-298; (2014), http://www.enerdata.net, Available from: (accessed 29.04.14)(2006), World reference base for soil resources 2006.

Additionally, the origin of air masses for the sampling days was calculated by 48-hbackward trajectories, subdivided into the four cardinal sectors. Significant lower PM10 mass concentrations were observed for summertime air masses from the west compared to the other seasons and cardinal sectors. For the OH. formation potency higher values were detected if air masses originate from east and south, thus predominantly being of continental origin. From the elevated OH. formation potencies in fall and winter a seasonal trend with low potencies in summers is assumed. Furthermore, source apportionment was performed by a positive matrix factor analysis, separating seven plausible factors which could be attributed to mineral dust, secondary nitrate, industry, non-exhaust traffic, fossil fuel combustion, marine aerosol and secondary aerosol factors. The intrinsic OH. formation potency was found to be associated mainly with the fossil fuel combustion factor (45%) and industry factor (22%). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","AU; DMPO; DMPO; DNA; EPR; EPR; Hydroxyl radical; HYSPLIT; LOD; NOAA-NCEP; Particulate matter; PM; PMF; ROS; ROS; Source apportionment; SPSS","Ayres, J.G., Borm, P.A., Cassee, F.R., Castranova, V., Donaldson, K., Ghio, A., Evaluating the toxicity of airborne particulate matter and nanoparticles by measuring oxidative stress potential - a workshop report and consensus statement (2008) Inhal.

This paper empirically analyzes how the Swedish carbon dioxide (CO2) tax and the European Union emission trading system (EU ETS) have affected productivity development in the Swedish pulp and paper industry 1998-2008. A Luenberger total factor productivity (TFP) indicator is computed using data envelopment analysis. The results show that climate policy had a modest impact on technological development in the pulp and paper industry, and if significant it was negative. The price of fossil fuels, on the contrary, seems to have created important incentives for technological development. Hence, the results suggest that the carbon prices faced by the industry through EU ETS and the CO2 tax have been too low. Even though the data for this study is specific for Sweden, the models and results are applicable internationally. When designing policy to mitigate CO2 emissions, it is vital that the policy creates a carbon price that is high enough - otherwise the pressure on technological development will not be sufficiently strong. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 tax; EU ETS; GMM; Luenberger total factor productivity indicator","Alonso-Borrego, C., Arellano, C., Symmetrically normalized instrumental-variable estimation using panel data (1999) J.Bus.

As a large share of the power generation is currently based on fossil fuels, mainly coal, with this trend expected to continue, clean coal technologies need to be developed. Carbon capture and storage using chemical solvents has been identified to be the most suitable option for coal-fired power plants. The technology which is closest to market commercialisation uses amines, such as monoethanolamine, as a solvent. However, high degradation rates due to impurities present in the flue gas and a considerable heat requirement for solvent regeneration make the application of alternative solvents necessary. In this study, a rate-based aqueous ammonia process model was developed, validated and then modified to a chilled ammonia process model. The model was then scaled up to process flue gas from a 580MWel supercritical coal-fired power plant. A sensitivity study revealed that the lowest parasitic load occurs for the lean solvent characterised by 12.5%wt NH3 concentration and 0.29 loading, with the stripper operated between 12.5 and 17.5bar. The equivalent work requirement for a CAP plant operated at such conditions was found to be up to 15.7% lower than the reference amine scrubbing plant. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon capture; Chilled ammonia process; Coal-fired power plant; Rate-based modelling","Abanades, C.J., Alvarez, D., Conversion limits in the reaction of CO2 with lime (2003) Energy Fuels, 17, pp. 308-315; Afkhamipour, M., Mofarahi, M., Comparison of rate-based and equilibrium-stage models of a packed column for post-combustion CO2 capture using 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) solution (2013) Int.

The analytes include organic carbon and elemental carbon (OC+EC=total carbon, TC), seven water-soluble inorganic ions (NH4 +, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, SO4 2-, NO3 -) and six trace elements (Ti, Mn, Fe, Zn, As, Pb). The average PM2.5 mass for the entire measurement period is 142.6±102.7μgm-3, which is more than four times that of the Chinese national ambient air quality standard. Spatial variations in PM2.5 mass are not pronounced. The PM2.5 mass and those species measured show a similar seasonal pattern in all six measurement sites, i.e., in the order of winter&gt;autumn&gt;spring&gt;summer. The dominant PM2.5 composition is OC in winter, soil dust in spring, and sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium in summer and autumn. Seasonal variations of TC/PM2.5 and OC/EC ratios follow the PM2.5 changes. Seasonal distributions of (SO4 2-+NO3 -+NH4 +)/PM2.5 showed increase in autumn and decrease in winter, while NO3 -/SO4 2- ratios increased in autumn and decreased in summer. Eight main PM2.5 sources are identified based on the positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis and emissions from fossil fuel combustion (traffic and coal burning) are founded to be the main source responsible for the fine particle pollution in Xi'an. In addition, a decreasing trend in OC/PM2.5 is observed in comparison with previous studies in Xi'an. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; PM2.5; PMF; Xi'an","Andreae, M.O., Soot carbon and excess fine potassium: long-range transport of combustion-derived aerosols (1983) Science, 220, pp. 1148-1151; Antony Chen, L.W., Watson, J.G., Chow, J.C., Magliano, K.L., Quantifying PM2.5 source contributions for the San Joaquin Valley with multivariate receptor models (2007) Environ Sci Technol, 41, pp. 2818-2826; Antony Chen, L.W., Watson, J.G., Chow, J.C., DuBois, D.W., Herschberger, L., Chemical mass balance source apportionment for combined PM2.5 measurements from U.S. non-urban and urban long-term networks (2010) Atmos Environ, 44, pp. 4908-4918; Arimoto, R., Duce, R.A., Savoie, D.L., Prospero, J.M., Talbot, R., Cullen, J.D., Relationships among aerosol constituents from Asia and the North Pacific during PEM-West A (1996) J Geophys Res Atmos, 101, pp. 2011-2023; Cachier, H., Ducret, J., Influence of biomass burning on equatorial African rains (1991) Nature, 352, pp. 228-230; Cachier, H., Bremond, M.P., Buatmenard, P., Carbonaceous aerosols from different tropical biomass burning sources (1989) Nature, 340, pp. 371-373; Cao, J.J., Lee, S.C., Ho, K.F., Zhang, X.Y., Zou, S.C., Fung, K., Characteristics of carbonaceous aerosol in Pearl River Delta Region, China during 2001 winter period (2003) Atmos Environ, 37, pp. 1451-1460; Cao, J.J., Lee, S.C., Ho, K.F., Zou, S.C., Fung, K., Li, Y., Spatial and seasonal variations of atmospheric organic carbon and elemental carbon in Pearl River Delta Region, China (2004) Atmos Environ, 38, pp. 4447-4456; Cao, J.J., Lee, S.C., Zhang, X.Y., Chow, J.C., An, Z.S., Ho, K.F., Characterization of airborne carbonate over a site near Asian dust source regions during spring 2002 and its climatic and environmental significance (2005) J Geophys Res Atmos, 110, p.

The model was established based on calculation of thermodynamic equilibrium of reactive multicomponent systems using Gibbs free energy minimization. Since this method has been widely used to estimate the composition of the syngas from wood gasification, the model was first validated by comparing its prediction results with those of similar models from the literature. The model was then used to evaluate the main gas emissions from the combustion of four dedicated energy crops (short-rotation willow, reed canary grass, switchgrass and miscanthus) previously burned in a 29-kW boiler. The prediction values revealed good agreement with the experimental results. The model was particularly effective in estimating the influence of harvest season on SO2 emissions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Agricultural biomass combustion; Gaseous emissions; Gibbs free energy; Prediction model","Altafini, C.R., Prediction of the working parameters of a wood waste gasifier through an equilibrium model (2003) Energy Convers.

Improving the understanding of the sustainable and realistic potential for biomass is crucial.We present a comprehensive, country-based, bottom-up assessment of the land-based global biofuel (bioethanol and biodiesel) potential, taking into account a range of scenarios with varying yield gradients, land-use change and technology development, covering energy from both lignocellulosic and food crops as well as residues from agriculture and forestry. We have also gone beyond many other studies by analysing the potential for food crop based biofuels as well as lignocellulosic-sourced biofuels.We find a global biofuel supply potential increasing from 15-70EJ final transport fuel energy (30-140EJ primary energy) currently to 40-190EJ (130-400EJ) in 2070, depending on the development of land-use, productivity and technology mix. Over 3/4 of this potential comes from energy crops: up to 70% could come from food crops and at least 10% from lignocellulosic crops. The remaining quarter would be from agricultural and forestry residues. For comparison, current (2010) total global energy use (fuel, heat and electricity) stands at 365EJ final energy (530EJ primary energy). Depending on demand developments, countries such as Brazil or Russia could become net bioenergy exporters in the second half of the century, while others, such as India or Nigeria, may become net importers. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Bioenergy; Crops; GAI; GHG; Global; LIIB; Potential; Residues; RF; RPR; SRES; SRREN","Barker, T., Bashmakov, I., Bernstein, L., Bogner, J.E., Bosch, P.R., Dave, R., Technical summary (2007) Climate change 2007: mitigation.

This has led to significant developments in the production of alternative fuels during the last years, which have made them a reliable and relatively efficient source of energy. One example of these alternative fuels is the pyrolysis oil. However, higher viscosity, lower heat content, limited chemical stability, and its ability to create sediment make pyrolysis oil challenging for gas turbines. The OPRA OP16 gas turbine is an all radial single-shaft gas turbine rated at 1.9MW. The all radial design, together with the lack of intricate cooling geometries in the hot section, makes this gas turbine suitable for operation on these fuels. This paper presents an experimental investigation of pyrolysis oil combustion in a tubular combustor developed, especially for low-calorific fuels. The experiments have been performed in an atmospheric combustion test rig, and the results have been compared to the results obtained from ethanol and diesel combustion. It was found that it was possible to burn pure pyrolysis oil in the load range between 70% and 100% with a combustion efficiency exceeding 99% and without creation of sediments on the combustor inner wall. It was found that the NOx emissions were similar for pyrolysis oil and diesel, whereas the CO emissions were twice as high for pyrolysis oil. A comparison between the air blast nozzle and the pressure nozzle was performed. The air blast nozzle was found to be more suitable due to its better performance over a wider operating range and that it is more resistant to erosion and abrasion. It was found that the maximum allowed droplet size of the pyrolysis oil spray should be about 50-70% of the droplet size for diesel fuel. © 2015 by ASME.",,"Peacocke, C., Joseph, S., Notes on terminology in thermal conversion International Biochar Initiative, Westerville, OH, IBI Information Paper: Biochar Production Technology and Terminology, , http://www.biochar-international.org/images/Terminology.doc, available at; Oasmaa, A., Peacocke, C., (2001) A Guide to Physical Property Characterization of Biomass Derived Fast Pyrolysis Liquids, , Technical Research Centre of Finland, Otaniemi, Espoo, Finland, VTT Publication 450; Shaddix, C.R., Hardesty, D.R., (1999) Combustion Properties of Biomass Flash Pyrolysis Oils: Final Project Report, , Sandia National Laboratory, Albuquerque, NM Report No. SAND99-8238; Chiaramonti, D., Oasmaa, A., Solantausta, Y., Power generation using fast pyrolysis liquids from biomass (2005) Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev, 11 (6), pp. 1056-1086; Czernik, S., Bridgwater, A.V., Overview of applications of biomass fast pyrolysis oil (2004) Energy Fuels, 18 (2), pp. 590-598; Lupandin, V., Nikolayev, A., Hexter, M., (2007) Lycoming T-53 Gas Turbine Engine Modification for Industrial Application, , ASME Paper No. GT2007-27517; Lefebvre, A., (1983) Gas Turbine Combustion, , Hemisphere, Washington, DC; Beran, M., Koranek, M., Axelsson, L., (2010) United States Patent Application for Low Calorific Fuel Combustor for Gas Turbines, p. 321. , U.S. Patent 12/926; Lefebvre, A., (1989) Atomization and Sprays, , Hemisphere, Washington, DC; Branca, C., Di Blasi, C., Elefante, R., Devolatilization and heterogeneous combustion of wood fast pyrolysis oils (2005) Ind.

The advent of carbon pricing (either through an emissions trading scheme or a carbon tax) represents an attempt to impose a cost on consumers that will limit such degradation (i.e. the deleterious impacts of climate change) to scientifically-determined acceptable levels. The resulting higher cost of fossil fuel combustion for power generation should induce a reduction in the demand for power (the demand effect) whilst simultaneously stimulating investment in competitively-priced low carbon power generation technologies (the supply effect). At least in theory, the trading of emission permits can be shown to be a least-cost economic instrument for meeting a specified level of reduction of carbon dioxide. However, a carbon tax possesses the same property. In this chapter the relative merits of these two instruments will be assessed, paying particular attention to factors that could, in practice, lead to significant levels of inefficiency for one instrument relative to the other. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

In order to bolster their adoption by consumers and hence enhance their penetration rate, a charging station infrastructure needs to be deployed. This paper studies decentralized policies that assign electric vehicles to a network of charging stations with the goal to achieve little to no queueing. This objective is especially important for electric vehicles, whose charging times are fairly long. The social optimality of the proposed policies is established when each station is equipped with multiple charging slots. Further, convergence issues of the algorithm that achieves the optimal policy are examined.

The GTCC manufacturers are in a fierce competition responding to these needs, especially for the best part load efficiency, the fastest load ramp capability and for the lowest low load power parking at an acceptable NOx and CO emission level. But there is an option outperforming the GTCC technology for the above mentioned requirements, which is theoretically known since years but it has not yet been practically developed. It is the semiclosed recuperated cycle (SCRC). Wettstein (2013) has described this recently in The Air Breathing Semiclosed Recuperated Cycle and Its Super Chargeable Predecessors, Gas Turbine World 2013, March/April Issue, Vol. 42, No. 2). The SCRC does not require any component technology, which is not yet proven in operating large commercial GTCC or GT plants. But of course the cycle integration is a different one, requiring a specific design of the components. An inherent side feature of the SCRC is the exhaust gas composition, which corresponds to a near-stoichiometric combustion gas. This allows comparing the SCRC with a (CO2) capture ready GTCC having exhaust gas recirculation. The above mentioned article, the thermodynamic performance analysis of a SCRC with an adiabatic compressor is described. But the cycle becomes even more attractive with an intercooling stage in each of the two compressors. Here, this is quantified with another detailed thermodynamic analysis. Additionally, also an ideal case with isothermal compression is analyzed. The latter is of course unrealistic for a practical realization. But it indicates the potential of using more than one intercooling stage per compressor. The aim of this paper is to quantitatively compare the three variants with adiabatic, intercooled and isothermal compressors. In all three cases the same turbine and recuperator temperature limitations are used while some other cycle data assumptions are adapted to the compressor technology in order to achieve an optimal performance level for each variant. The thermodynamic results have been cross-checked with a breakdown of the exergy losses in the three variants. The final results for base load operation indicate that the intercooled variant could become the best choice.",,,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907855735

Yet, intermittency is usually ignored in life-cycle cost calculations intended to assess the competitiveness of electric power from renewable as opposed to dispatchable energy sources, such as fossil fuels. This paper demonstrates that for intermittent renewable power sources a traditional life-cycle cost calculation should be appended by a correction factor which we term the Co-Variation coefficient. It captures any synergies, or complementarities, between the time-varying patterns of electricity generation and pricing. We estimate the Co-Variation coefficient for specific settings in the western United States. Our estimates imply that the benchmark of cost competitiveness for solar photovoltaic (PV) power is 10 to 15% lower than previous average life-cycle cost analyses have suggested. In contrast, the generation pattern of wind power exhibits complementarities with electricity pricing schedules, yielding a cost assessment that is higher than that suggested by traditional calculations. For the specific settings we study, the corresponding magnitude of the markup is 10 to 15%. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Intermittent electricity generation; Levelized cost of electricity; Renewable energy; Solar PV; Wind power","Baker, E., Fowlie, M., Lemoine, D., Reynolds, S., The economics of solar electricity (2013) Ann.

Historically, local architecture was based on people's experience and knowledge. It was sympathetic to the climate and environment. After a period of building design that ignored the local climate, more passive buildings, low energy buildings, and zero buildings have come into focus because of the environmental pollution caused by an excessive use of fossil fuels. The historic architectural style in Dezful includes underground shelters, 5-12. m deep, to improve the indoor climate conditions in this hot and semi humid city. This type of underground shelter, known as a Shavadoon, is regarded as one of the passive energy strategies to seek temperature comfort using the earth annual temperature stability and natural ventilation. The present study was conducted in a house owned by Mohammad Reza Ghamsari. The house was used to test the accuracy of numerical simulation of the temperature and air flow within the Shavadoon spaces. Temperature contours, streamlines, and other related findings are reported. The results show that space conditioning costs could be cut and adequate comfort could be derived using such passive heating and cooling systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","CFD analysis; Dezful; Hot and humid climate; Shavadoon; Underground space","Anselm, A.J., Passive annual heat storage principles in earth sheltered housing, a supplementary energy saving system in residential housing (2008) Energy Build., 40, pp. 1214-1219; Asfour, O.S., Gadi, M.B., Using CFD to investigate ventilation characteristics of vaults as wind-inducing devices in buildings (2008) Appl.

Seven oils, those of corn, groundnut, palm, rapeseed, soybean, sunflower and the micro-algae species Chlorella protothecoides were tested, with all of the fuels heated to 60 °C, at constant injection timing and constant ignition timing at a constant engine speed of 1200 rpm. All of the vegetable oils exhibited a duration of ignition delay within ±0.6 CAD of that displayed by a reference fossil diesel, but displayed much reduced rates of peak heat release rate. The duration of ignition delay was found to increase with an increasing carbon to hydrogen ratio of the vegetable oils, implicating the fatty acid alkyl chain as the primary driver of low temperature reactivity. Peak heat release rates decreased with decreasing vegetable oil viscosity, suggesting a significant degree of fuel cylinder wall and piston bowl impingement. At both injection timings, emissions of NOx were lower for all of the vegetable oils relative to the reference fossil diesel, while those of CO, THC and particulate matter were higher and sensitive to the injection timing. © 2014 The Authors.","Biofuels; Diesel combustion; Fatty acid structure; Micro-algae; Straight vegetable oil","(2012) COMMISSIon E.

The eco-efficiency indicator, which simultaneously accounts for economic and environmental features, is also calculated. The centralized configuration offers better economic performance for small-scale biorefineries, while the distributed configuration is economically superior for large-scale biorefineries. The MESP of the centralized configuration declines with increased biorefinery size up to a point and then rises due to the cost of trucking biomass to the biorefinery. In contrast, the MESP in the distributed configuration continuously declines with increasing biorefinery size due to the lower costs of railroad transportation and the greater economies of scale achieved at much larger biorefinery sizes, including biorefineries that reach the size of an average oil refinery-about 30,000 tons per day of feedstock. The centralized system yields lower environmental impacts for most impact categories than does the distributed system regardless of the biorefinery size. Eco-efficiency analysis shows that the centralized configuration is more sustainable for small-scale biorefineries, while the distributed configuration with railroad transport is more sustainable for large-scale biorefineries. Compared with gasoline from petroleum, cellulosic ethanol fuel offers sustainability advantages for the following environmental impact categories: fossil energy consumption, global warming, human health impacts by particulate matter, ozone layer depletion, ecotoxicity, human health cancer, and human health non-cancer, depending somewhat on the biorefinery sizes and the system configurations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","ACID; AFEX; Cellulosic ethanol; Corn stover; DCFROR; Distributed biomass processing; ECOT; EISA; EUTR; FSE; GE; GHG; GREET; GWI; HHC; HHNC; HHP; IPCC; Life cycle assessment; Local biomass processing depot; MESP; Minimum ethanol selling price; NREL; OLD; PDF; SMG","(2015), http://ethanolrfa.org/pages/World-Fuel-Ethanol-Production, [Internet].

However, current industrial hydrogen production processes, such as steam reforming of methane, contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect. Therefore alternative methods, in particular the use of fermentative microorganisms, have attracted scientific interest in recent years. However the low overall yield obtained is a major challenge in biological H<inf>2</inf> production. Thus, a thorough and detailed understanding of the relationships between genome content, gene expression patterns, pathway utilisation and metabolite synthesis is required to optimise the yield of biohydrogen production pathways. Results: In this study transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of the hydrogen-producing bacterium Clostridium butyricum CWBI 1009 were carried out to provide a biomolecular overview of the changes that occur when the metabolism shifts to H<inf>2</inf> production. The growth, H<inf>2-</inf>production, and glucose-fermentation profiles were monitored in 20 L batch bioreactors under unregulated-pH and fixed-pH conditions (pH 7.3 and 5.2). Conspicuous differences were observed in the bioreactor performances and cellular metabolisms for all the tested metabolites, and they were pH dependent. During unregulated-pH glucose fermentation increased H<inf>2</inf> production was associated with concurrent strong up-regulation of the nitrogenase coding genes. However, no such concurrent up-regulation of the [FeFe] hydrogenase genes was observed. During the fixed pH 5.2 fermentation, by contrast, the expression levels for the [FeFe] hydrogenase coding genes were higher than during the unregulated-pH fermentation, while the nitrogenase transcripts were less abundant. The overall results suggest, for the first time, that environmental factors may determine whether H<inf>2</inf> production in C. butyricum CWBI 1009 is mediated by the hydrogenases and/or the nitrogenase. Conclusions: This work, contributing to the field of dark fermentative hydrogen production, provides a multidisciplinary approach for the investigation of the processes involved in the molecular H<inf>2</inf> metabolism of clostridia. In addition, it lays the groundwork for further optimisation of biohydrogen production pathways based on genetic engineering techniques. © 2015 Calusinska et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","2D-DIGE; Clostridium butyricum; Dark fermentation; Nitrogenase; RNA-seq; [FeFe] hydrogenase",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928660745

Biomass can be converted to synthesis gas, which can serve as a source for various liquid and gaseous fuels. Although significant progress has been achieved in the overall process, both economic and technical challenges still need to be overcome. Many pilot plants are already in operation and the first demonstration and semi-commercial installations are under construction or starting to operate. Catalysis is a key parameter in the conversion of synthesis gas to fuels. The aim of this work is to present the latest advances in the catalytic conversion of synthesis gas to Fischer-Tropsch gasoline and diesel, synthetic natural gas, ethanol and mixed alcohols.

All the frequent practices have been intensified in order to utilize the earth and its environment as a source of energy. Hence, architects and planners have a special responsibility toward energy efficiency development. Here, the overall objective striven for is to introduce solar energy as a permanent renewable source in order to reduce energy consumption and building initial investment. Thus, the variable output of utilizing active and passive solar systems and their impact on the decrease of energy usage and total energy demands for cooling and heating buildings should be considered as the main objective of this research and the result could be a new definition of architecture and construction, so, this branch of industry can supply the necessary contributions for sustainable and viable development. Thereby, this study is mainly based on a theoretical approach supported by the outcomes of literature review and case study analysis from the solar design aspects. Finally, as skyscrapers are indispensable in modern cities and as they consume a great deal of energy, considering new ways of benefiting renewable energies can have a vital role in reducing building energy consumption. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This grid can spread the intelligence of the energy distribution and control system from the central unit to the long-distance remote areas, thus enabling accurate state estimation (SE) and wide-area real-time monitoring of these intermittent energy sources. In contrast to the traditional methods of SE, this paper proposes a novel accuracy dependent Kalman filter (KF) based microgrid SE for the smart grid that uses typical communication systems. Then this article proposes a discrete-time linear quadratic regulation to control the state deviations of the microgrid incorporating multiple DERs. Therefore, integrating these two approaches with application to the smart grid forms a novel contributions in green energy and control research communities. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed KF based microgrid SE and control algorithm provides an accurate SE and control compared with the existing method. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Discrete-time algebraic riccati equations; Distributed energy resource; Kalman filter; Smart grid; State estimation; Wireless sensor networks","Martinez, S.R., Garcia, S.A.J., Garcia, S.F., Garcia, H.J., Flynn, D., A comprehensive WSN-based approach to efficiently manage a smart grid (2014) Sensors, 14, pp. 18748-18783; Liang, Y., Jiang, T., Cao, Y., Qi, Q., Carbon-aware energy cost minimization for distributed internet data centers in smart microgrids (2014) IEEE Internet Things J, 1, pp. 255-264; Li, H., Han, Z., Distributed scheduling of wireless communication for voltage control in micro smart grid (2011) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications, pp. 1188-1193. , Houston, TX, USA, 5–9 December; Rana, M.M., Li, L., Microgrid state estimation and control for smart grid and the internet of things communication network (2015) Electron.

CentreVille, Montréal, QC, Canada","Engineered fuels (EF) manufactured from waste can be an advantageous substitute for coal or other fossil fuel in (co-)combustion, gasification or pyrolysis processes. Unfortunately, because of their heterogeneity, the thermal behavior of such fuels can often be complex, limiting their application. In the present study, the pyrolysis of a heterogeneous commercial EF composed of fibers and plastics was investigated using a TGA apparatus over a large range of heating rates (from 5 to 400°C/min). At a heating rate of 5°C/min, the EF devolatilization curve was simply a proportional sum of the devolatilization curves of its individual components. When the heating rate was increased up to 100°C/min, however, a shift in the devolatilization TG curve of the fibers, plastics and EF to higher temperatures was observed as a consequence of heat transfer limitations within samples. Furthermore, differences between the proportional sum of the devolatilization curves of the individual components of the EF and its experimental curve were observed, and increased with increasing heating rates up to 400°C/min. A model was developed to correct for heat transfer limitations by considering thermal phenomena such as heat transfer limitations between the TGA and the sample, change in sample heat capacity and effect of endothermic reactions on sample temperature. This model predicted the shift of EF devolatilization towards higher temperature with increasing heating rates, which suggests that no significant chemical effects occurred between the EF components. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Most energy extraction and conversion technologies have associated freshwater demand, and in the MENA region these account for 2 % of the available sustainable supply. We examine how this demand could change over the 21st century, assuming growth in population and economic output, and considering three alternative pathways for energy efficiency, carbon intensity, and energy exports from the region. We find that in the pathway marked by improved efficiency, a transition to renewable energy sources, and declining energy exports, water consumption for energy is twice as high as today’s values by the end of the century. By contrast, in the pathway marked by continued commitment to fossil resource extraction, use, and export, water demand for energy might rise by a factor of five. If the region were to maintain high levels of energy exports, but would substitute the export of fossil fuels by an equivalent amount of electricity derived from sunlight, a freshwater volume comparable to the household needs of up to 195 million people could be saved. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922496030

Renewable fuels can be used predominantly as fuel for both transportation and power generation applications. Improved engine performance with reduced engine exhaust emissions is a major research objective in engine development. Today, the use of biomass derived producer gas is more relevant for addressing rural power generation and is a promising technique for controlling both nitric oxide (NOx) and soot emission levels. In view of this, exhaustive experiments on the use of Honge oil methyl ester (HOME)–Producer gas in a dual fuel engine have been carried out with an intension of improving its fuel efficiency. This paper mainly presents results on a single cylinder four stroke direct injection diesel engine operated in dual fuel mode using HOME–Producer gas combination with and without bio-ethanol addition and thermal barrier coating (TBC). Further, the results were compared with diesel–producer gas mode of operation. Experimental investigation on dual fuel operation using HOME+5% bioethanol (BE5)–Producer gas operation with TBC showed 12.35% increased brake thermal efficiency with decreased hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions and increased NOx emission levels compared to HOME–Producer gas mode of operation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis","bio-ethanol; combustion; emissions; heat release rate; Honge oil methyl ester; thermal barrier coating",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922981792

Of the various production methods for H2, photocatalysis requires further development so that it can be applied economically on an industrial scale. One- and two-dimensional nanostructures in both pristine and modified forms have shown great potential as catalysts in the generation of H2. We review here recent developments in these nanostructure catalysts and their efficiency in the generation of H2 under UV/visible/simulated solar light. Despite much research effort, many photocatalysts do not yet meet the practical requirements for the generation of H2, such as visible light activity. H2 production is dependent on a variety of parameters and factors. To meet future energy demands, several challenges in H2 production still need to be solved. We address here the factors that influence the efficiency of H2 production and suggest alternatives. The nanostructures are classified based on their morphology and their efficiency is considered with respect to the influencing parameters. We suggest effective ways of engineering catalyst combinations to overcome the current performance barriers. © the Owner Societies 2014.",,"Zou, Z., Ye, J., Sayama, K., Arakawa, H., (2001) Nature, 414, pp. 625-627; Ashokkumar, M., (1998) Int.

Hydrogen can be generated from fossil fuels like methane without CO<inf>2</inf> emissions by pyrolysis at temperatures above 600°C.In the fluid wall flow reactor concept, the heating gas is introduced through a porous reactor wall. Using a ceramic membrane with 3μm pore diameter and helium as heating gas proved the best choice for long-term experimentation. The influence of methane diffusion into the outer heating chamber was studied and explains the decrease in conversion from 53% to 7% over 7h, after which the conversion remains low but constant.The slug flow of methane and molten metal in a capillary enables one to extend the pyrolysis residence time and, if the molten metal forms a contiguous thin liquid film on the capillary wall, to avoid problems with carbon deposition and reverse reaction. The studies presented, using a 2mm ID quartz glass capillary with molten tin and nitrogen and a superficial velocity of 0.092ms-1, demonstrate that the use of molten metal in the capillary reactor is both controllable and feasible. Initial experiments with methane at 1100°C and a superficial velocity of 0.122ms-1 show that methane can be decomposed with an average conversion of 32% and without carbon depositions. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.","Fluid wall flow reactor; Methane pyrolysis; Molten metal capillary reactor; Thermal decomposition",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927145684

Impurities and/or other constituents in CO2 source streams selected for sequestration can affect both the chemical and physical (e.g., density, viscosity, interfacial tension) properties of CO2 in the deep subsurface. The nature and concentrations of these impurities are a function of both the industrial source(s) of CO2, as well as the carbon capture technology used to extract the CO2 and produce a concentrated stream for subsurface injection and geologic sequestration. Most work on CO2 capture, utilization, and storage has been focused on large fossil-fuel-fired power plants. This article reviews the relative concentrations of CO2 and other constituents in exhaust gases from other major non-power-related industrial point sources. Assuming that carbon capture technology would remove most of the air (i.e., incondensable gases N2, O2, and Ar) from the exhaust gases, the authors summarize the relative proportions of SO2, NOx and other remaining impurities expected to still be present in non-power-related CO2 source streams that could be targeted for geologic sequestration. The summary is presented relative to the four largest non-power-related sources of CO2: (1) use of fossil fuels as carbon feedstock, (2) iron, steel, and metallurgical coke production, (3) lime and Portland cement production, and (4) natural gas processing and industrial heat/steam generation. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","Carbon dioxide; CO2 impurities; CO2 sequestration; CO2 source streams",,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922471132

The respondents were employed in forestry in either public or private forests or working for state authorities. They were specifically asked about the related impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems, adaptive forest management and the potential of forestry to mitigate climate change. A factor analysis of the responses revealed significant variables explaining the major part of the variance and the key variable groups were identified in a canonical analysis. The majority of respondents (72 %) said they were under-informed, but most (83 %) view climate change as a reality, human-caused, and a significant risk. These forestry professionals were particularly concerned about extreme hazards, water scarcity, and changes in climatic zones. They generally said the potential of forestry to mitigate climate change is low, and saw few realistic measures like increased harvesting to substitute fossil fuels and energy-intensive materials for mitigation. Despite the uncertainty involved, adaptation strategies like using better-adapted tree species and provenances were mainly perceived as helpful, and tools such as spatially-explicit maps with recommendations for adapted species and indices of biotic and abiotic risks as important. The forestry professionals reported obtaining their information about climate change from advanced forestry training, the media, and scientific literature. The findings of the study are discussed in the light of the ongoing debate on climate change in Germany and recommendations made, including periodically checking and improving forestry professionals’ knowledge about climate change. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht",,,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922438922

Cost and recovery of synthetic catalysts are major challenges in carbonaceous materials catalytic gasification. Biomass rich in alkali metals can be added as fuel and also to provide inexpensive natural catalysts to boost fossil fuel gasification. Biomass/fossil fuel co-gasification could provide bridging energy production based on renewable and fossil fuels. In this work, CO2 co-gasification of switchgrass and sawdust with coal and fluid coke was conducted in a thermogravimetric analyzer. Gasification kinetics were inhibited or enhanced, depending on the potassium concentration in the mixture. For low K/Al and K/Si molar ratios, the coal ash sequestered the biomass potassium needed for KAlSiO4 formation, and thus, no catalytic effect was observed until the biomass-to-coal mass ratio reached 3:1, where the switchgrass ash supplied enough potassium to more than satisfy the minerals in the coal ash. For high K/Al and K/Si molar ratios, unreacted residual potassium acted as catalyst, enhancing coal gasification. Fluid coke contained much lower Al and Si than for the coal. Hence, the gasification kinetics of fluid coke were significantly augmented by blending the coke with switchgrass due to the abundance of potassium in the biomass. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Alkali metals; Biomass; Catalysis; Co-gasification; Fossil fuel; Sustainable energy","(2004) World population to 2300, , United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, New York; (2013) International energy statistics database, , http://www.eia.gov/ies,www.qeia.gov/ies, (as of November 2012); (2014) BP statistical review of world energy, , http://bp.com/statisticalreview,bp.com/statisticalreview; (2014), Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).

The cycle was described over 150. years ago and significant performance advances continue to be realised. On-going metallurgy research has enabled the operating pressure and temperature of the boiler and turbine to be increased, thereby improving the cycle efficiency. The ubiquitous use of the Rankine cycle on a massive scale in conjunction with fossil fuels as the energy source continues to motivate further efficiency improvements in the cycle.Previous work established a theoretical basis for the use of thermoelectric heat pumps (THPs) in the condensation process of the Rankine cycle to positively impact cycle efficiency. The work presented here experimentally validates this prior work and provides performance metrics for current commercially available THPs and quantifies how their use can increase the efficiency of the Rankine cycle as implemented in a large power plant.A commercial THP is characterised to obtain its Coefficient of Performance (COP) variation with input current and the amount of thermal energy transported. A larger-scale system comprising of a multistage thermoelectric heat pump is then considered, demonstrating that using commonly available THPs a fuel load reduction of over 1.5% is achievable for a typical 600MWe generating set whilst simultaneously increasing the overall plant cycle efficiency from 44.9% to 45.05%.The paper concludes with a cost-benefit analysis of the system, showing that over a four year period the saving in fuel used can easily re-coup the capital cost incurred by the addition of the condenser heat pump. © 2014 The Authors.","Heat pumping; Rankine cycle; Thermal power plant cycle efficiency; Thermoelectric","Bugge, J.R., Kjær, S., Blum, R., High-efficiency coal-fired power plants development and perspectives (2006) Energy, 31 (10-11), pp. 1437-1445. , http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0360544205001416; Yang, H., Xu, Z., Fan, M., Gupta, R., Slimane, R.B., Bland, A.E., Progress in carbon dioxide separation and capture: a review (2008) J Environ Sci (China), 20 (1), pp. 14-27. , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18572517; A Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050.

For this purpose, different types of heat recovery systems have been designed and built. One of the most industrial applicable systems is a thermal regenerator that has widespread applications in energy industries such as glass, aluminium, and power plants. In aluminium and glass melting furnaces such system can be applied to preheat combustion air by absorbing heat from flue gases that results considerable fuel saving in the furnace. Due to the high temperature application of such systems, the packing must be constructed from low conductivity ceramic materials and the mechanism of heat transfer will be convection and radial conduction inside the solids. This paper presents the results of the mathematical modelling and simulation studies of a regenerator filled with spherical shape packing made from alumina with different diameters. For the modelling purposes two mathematical models have been considered; simplest convection model and more complex radial conduction model inside the packing particles. For the evaluation of the model and to study the effect of different parameters such as gas mass flow rate, period time and ball diameter on the performance of the system, an experimental setup has been designed and built. The results clearly show that decreasing of gas mass flow rate, period time and packing diameter increase the system efficiency. Finally, a simulation software package has been developed and used for the prediction of output parameters in two industrial cases and excellent agreement has been obtained that proves the accuracy of the model for the high temperature applications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Aluminium Melting Furnaces; Finite difference; Fixed-bed regenerator; Heat recovery; Modelling","Sadrameli, S.M., (1997) Industrial Heat Recovery Systems, , Nashre Daneshgah Ministry of Energy Iran; http://www.industrialheater.comHolmanz, J., (2000) Heat Transfer, , McGraw-Hill USA; Nusselt, W., Die theorie des winderhitzers (1927) V.D.I, 71, pp. 85-99; Schmidt, F., Willmott, A., (1981) Thermal Energy Storage and Regeneration, , Taylor and Francis USA; Willmott, A., (2002) Dynamics of Regenerative Heat Transfer, , Taylor and Francis USA; Hausen, H., (1983) Heat Transfer in Counter Flow, Parallel Flow and Cross Flow Heat Exchangers, , McGraw-Hill USA; Heggs, P.J., Handley, D., The effect of thermal conductivity of the packing materials on transient heat transfer in a fixed bed (1969) Int.

Here we used molecular fire markers, benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCAs), to reconstruct fire history in two Eifel maar lakes, Germany. We hypothesized to find indications for (i) changes in BC related to ecosystem changes, (ii) an increase in BC influx at the onset of agriculture until modern times, and (iii) a change in BC quality due to technical progress in combustion, e.g., at the beginning of agriculture and at the onset of the Bronze Age. To calculate absolute BC influx into the maar lakes, we multiplied BC contents with sedimentation rates. The BC influx rates were elevated during tundra-like vegetation in the Late Pleistocene (up to 7.7g BCm-2a-1), followed by relatively constant 2.5gBCm-2a-1 from the Bølling interstadial (&gt;13.7kilo years before present, kaBP) until the early Atlantic when forest began to develop. Thereafter, BC influx increased with the onset of land use of Neolithic cultures in the region from 7.5kaBP to rates of 7-9gBCm-2a-1. Noteworthy, also the quality of BC changed: higher ratios of five-to six-times carboxylated benzenes (B5CA/B6CA) pointed at colder, arable fires approximately 1000 years after first Neolithic activity from 6 to 4kaBP (B5CA/B6CA increased from 1.0 to 2.0). From 4kaBP (Bronze Age) to modern times increasing burning temperatures as indicated by dropping B5CA/B6CA ratios (from 2.0 to 1.0) were related to metallurgy and industrialization. Between 2.5 and 1kaBP maximum BC influx rates were reached with ca 15gBCm-2a-1. With increasing combustion efficiency and a reduction of wild fires during the last centuries, total BC influx decreased, suggesting that fossil fuel combustion contributed less to total BC input into the lake sediments than former vegetation fires. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Fire regime; Fire temperature; Human-fire interaction; Palaeoclimate","Archibald, S., The fire-vegetation-climate system - how ecology can contribute to earth system science (2013) South Afr.

Research cigarettes smoked by a smoking machine are used as a reproducible model system for solid-state biomass combustion, which up to now is not addressable by current combustion-diagnostic tools. By combining repetitively recorded online measurement sequences from different sampling locations in an imaging approach, highly time- and space-resolved quantitative distribution maps of, e.g.; nitrogen monoxide, benzene, and oxygen concentrations were obtained at a near microscopic level. The obtained quantitative distribution maps represent a time-resolved, movie-like imaging of the respective compounds formation and destruction zones in the various combustion and pyrolysis regions of a cigarette during puffing. Furthermore, spatially resolved kinetic data were ascertainable. The here demonstrated methodology can also be applied to various heterogenic combustion/pyrolysis or reaction model systems, such as fossil- or biomass-fuel pellet combustion or to a positional resolved analysis of heterogenic catalytic reactions. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Danna, A., (2009) Proc.

Four critical countries (China, USA, Canada and Australia) were examined in detail with projections made on the state/province level. Ultimately Recoverable Resources (URR) for fossil fuels were estimated for three scenarios: Low = 48.4 ZJ, Best Guess (BG) = 75.7 ZJ, High = 121.5 ZJ. The scenarios were developed using Geologic Resources Supply-Demand Model (GeRS-DeMo). The Low and Best Guess (BG) scenarios suggest that world fossil fuel production may peak before 2025 and decline rapidly thereafter. The High scenario indicates that fossil fuels may have a strong growth till 2025 followed by a plateau lasting approximately 50 years before declining. All three scenarios suggest that world coal production may peak before 2025 due to peaking Chinese production and that only natural gas could have strong growth in the future. In addition, by converting the fossil fuel projections to greenhouse gas emissions, the projections were compared to IPCC scenarios which indicated that based on current estimates of URR there are insufficient fossil fuels to deliver the higher emission IPCC scenarios A1Fl and RCP8.5. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

First of all, it is a clean fuel that can be used instead of hydrocarbons, which produce CO2, a greenhouse gas emission that is thought to be the reason for climate change in the world. The largest source of hydrogen is the water gas shift (WGS) reaction, where CO and water are mixed over a catalyst to produce the desired hydrogen. Many researchers have focused on development of WGS catalysts with different metals. The most notable of these metals are precious and rare earth metals which, when combined, have unique properties for the WGS reaction. Research in this area is very important to the energy industry and the future of energy around the world. However, the progress made recently has not been reviewed, and this review was designed to fill the gap. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Coal gasification; H2 production; Steam reforming; Water gas shift reaction","Kenarsari, S.D., Yang, D., Jiang, G., Zhang, S., Wang, J., Russell, A.G., Review of recent advances in carbon dioxide separation and capture (2013) RSC Adv, 3 (45), pp. 22739-22773; Tuwati, A., Fan, M., Russell, A.G., Wang, J., Dacosta, H.F., New CO2 sorbent synthesized with nanoporous TiO(OH)2 and K2CO3 (2013) Energy Fuels, 27 (12), pp. 7628-7636; He, L., Fan, M., Dutcher, B., Cui, S., Shen, X.-D., Kong, Y., Dynamic separation of ultradilute CO2 with a nanoporous amine-based sorbent (2012) Chem Eng J, (0), pp. 13-23; Kishimoto, A., Kansha, Y., Fushimi, C., Tsutsumi, A., Exergy recuperative CO2 gas separation in pre-combustion capture (2012) Clean Technol Environ Policy, 14 (3), pp. 465-474; Dutcher, B., Fan, M., Leonard, B., Dyar, M.D., Tang, J., Speicher, E.A., Use of nanoporous FeOOH as a catalytic support for NaHCO3 decomposition aimed at reduction of energy requirement of Na2CO3/NaHCO3 based CO2 separation technology (2011) J Phys Chem C, 115 (31), pp. 15532-15544; Zhang, B.-T., Fan, M., Bland, A.E., CO2 separation by a new solid K-Fe sorbent (2011) Energy Fuels, 25 (4), pp. 1919-1925; http://www.eia.gov/, [cited 2014 4/28]Callaghan, C.A., (2006) Kinetics and catalysis of the water-gas-shift reaction: a microkinetic and graph theoretic approach, , Worcester Polytechnic Institute; Bell, D.A., Towler, B.F., Fan, M., (2010) Coal gasification and its applications, , William Andrew; Soo, S., Gibbs, R., A steam process for coal gasification (1979) Energy, 4 (2), pp. 357-364; Salhi, N., Boulahouache, A., Petit, C., Kiennemann, A., Rabia, C., Steam reforming of methane to syngas over NiAl2O4 spinel catalysts (2011) Int J Hydrogen Energy, 36 (17), pp. 11433-11439; Molina, A., Mondragón, F., Reactivity of coal gasification with steam and CO2 (1998) Fuel, 77 (15), pp. 1831-1839; Elliott, D.C., Sealock, L.J., Aqueous catalyst systems for the water-gas shift reaction. 1.

A multiregional hybridized life cycle assessment (LCA) model is used to evaluate several electricity generation technologies with and without carbon dioxide capture and storage. Based on data from the UNFCCC and other literature sources, it is shown that methane emissions from fossil fuel production vary more widely than commonly acknowledged in the LCA literature. This high variability, together with regional disparity in methane emissions, points to the existence of both significant uncertainty and natural variability. The results indicate that the impact of fugitive methane emissions can be significant, ranging from 3% to 56% of total impacts depending on type of technology and region. Total GHG emissions, in CO2-eq./kWh, vary considerably according to the region of the power plant, plant type, and the choice of associated fugitive methane emissions, with values as low as 0.08kg CO2-eq./kWh and as high as 1.52kg CO2-eq./kWh. The variability indicates significant opportunities for controlling methane emissions from fuel chains. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Coal; Electricity generation; Fugitive emissions; Life cycle assessment; Natural gas","Alvarez, R.A., Pacala, S.W., Winebrake, J.J., Chameides, W.L., Hamburg, S.P., Greater focus needed on methane leakage from natural gas infrastructure (2012) Proc.

This work analyzes the effects of biomass co-firing in the physical characteristics and oscillation patterns of the flame, by means of a digital imaging system installed in a 500 kWth semi-industrial scale swirl burner. The system is based on a monochrome CCD (Charged Couple Device) camera of high-speed frame rate (120 frames per second). Processing stage comprises the digital analysis in the spatial and spectral domain of recorded videos. Several co-firing flames with two biomass fuels (Cynara cardunculus and Populus sp.) were investigated, at substitution percentages ranging from 0% to 15%, energy basis. Spatial analysis of swirling flames highlights the effects of biomass addition in terms of luminous fluctuation rates and symmetry properties. With the joint analysis of flame derived parameters and CO emissions, flame flicker has been proved as a potential indicator of combustion performance. Additionally, a deeper investigation of luminous flame signal throughout its resulting histogram, have found new outcomes in the identification of instabilities of combustion process. Kurtosis and skewness parameters have shown an interesting response when CO emissions increase resulting in a promising option to develop monitoring and control systems based in non-intrusive measurements. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass co-firing; CCD camera; Combustion performance; Digital image processing; Flame monitoring; Swirl burner","Baxter, L., Biomass-coal co-combustion: Opportunity for affordable renewable energy (2005) Fuel, 84, pp. 1295-1302; De, S., Assadi, M., Impact of cofiring biomass with coal in power plants: A techno-economic assessment (2009) Biomass and Bioenergy, 33, pp. 283-293; De, W.L.V., Kamp, S., Morgan, D.J., The co-firing of pulverised bituminous coals with straw, waste paper and municipal sewage sludge (1996) Combustion Science and Technology, 121, pp. 317-332; Sami, M., Annamalai, K., Wooldridge, M., Co-firing of coal and biomass fuel blends (2001) Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 27, pp. 171-214; Gubba, S., Ma, L., Pourkashanian, M., Williams, A., Influence of particle shape and internal thermal gradients of biomass particles on pulverised coal/biomass co-fired flames (2011) Fuel Processing Technology, 92, pp. 2185-2195; Ballester, J., García-Armingol, T., Diagnostic techniques for the monitoring and control of practical flames (2010) Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 36, pp. 375-411; Huang, B., Luo, Z., Zhou, H., Optimization of combustion based on introducing radiant energy signal in pulverized coal-fired boiler (2010) Fuel Processing Technology, 91, pp. 660-668; Da Silva, R.C., Kangwanpongpan, T., Krautz, H.J., Flame pattern, temperatures and stability limits of pulverized oxy-coal combustion (2014) Fuel, 115, pp. 507-520; Zhou, H., Tang, Q., Yang, L., Yan, Y., Lu, G., Cen, K., Support vector machine based online coal identification through advanced flame monitoring (2014) Fuel, 117, pp. 944-951; Lu, G., Yan, Y., Cornwell, S., Whitehouse, M., Riley, G., Impact of co-firing coal and biomass on flame characteristics and stability (2008) Fuel, 87, pp. 1133-1140; Lu, G., Siouris, S., Yan, Y., Wilson, C., Cornwell, S., Concurrent measurement of combustion oscillation and temperature of multiple flames in a simulated gas turbine (2004) Instrum.

BC concentration shows a prominent seasonal and diurnal variation associated with the meteorological parameters. The mean BC concentration varied from 5μg/m3 to 27μg/m3 seasonally. The variation of BC mass concentration and its significant association with atmospheric parameters such as temperature profile, relative humidity and wind speed have been studied. Moreover, the influence of the transported air masses on BC concentration at different seasons has also been discussed.

One of the main contributing sectors to GHG emissions is the energy sector, due to its high dependency on fossil fuels. Renewable energy systems, notably solar energy, can be an effective climate change mitigation alternative. Photovoltaic (PV) technology provides an interesting method to produce electricity through a virtually infinite renewable resource at the human time scale: solar radiation. This study evaluates the current and future solar energy potential through the use of grid-connected PV power plants at the scale of countries within the Black Sea catchment. Simulated data are used to determine potential change in climate and land-use according to two different development scenarios. Incident solar radiation flux from re-analyses, spatial interpolation, and the application of the Delta change method are used to assess the current and future solar resource potential within this catchment. Potential sites suitable for PV power plants are selected following a Fuzzy logic approach, and thus the total potential solar energy through PV power generation can be determined. Results show that climate change will have little impact on the solar radiation resource, while land-use change induces more variability. However, regardless of the scenario followed, the solar energy potential is sufficient to provide an interesting contribution to the electricity generation mix of most countries within the Black Sea region. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Black sea catchment; Climate change; EnviroGRIDS; Land-use change; Photovoltaic potential; Solar radiation","Aguilar, C., Herrero, J., Polo, M.J., Topographic effects on solar radiation distribution in mountainous watersheds and their influence on reference evapotranspiration estimates at watershed scale (2010) Hydrol.

Today, biofuels are only a small share of world total energy supply. The characterization of biomass is a substantial improvement in the valorization of these resources, allowing a rational and controlled use of its energy potential. Therefore, a fast, reliable and cheap analytical technique is mandatory in order to increase the quality control of these products in the bioenergetic industry and enable comprehensive traceability of raw materials and processes in pursuit of a better use of resources. Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is eligible for the development of quality control systems of products and processes in accordance with the new demands taking into account their high response speed, low cost per sample, absence of sample preparation, versatility for the analysis of many different products and parameters. NIR spectroscopy prediction model for determination of quality parameters such us moisture, gross energetic value, ash content, volatile fraction content, and elemental composition (Carbon, Hydrogen, and Nitrogen) from ground and dried olive residues have been obtained. High accuracy in prediction for a test set has been achieved for all the parameters (R20.7) except for Hydrogen content. As expected, Standard Error of Prediction (SEP) for ground samples is better than dried samples except for moisture content. This study illustrates the possibility of using the NIR technique in combination with multivariate data analysis to predict economically important properties of olive byproducts for energetic uses. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","""Orujillo""; Chemometrics; Energetic uses; Near infrared spectroscopy; Olive stone; Olive tree pruning","(1998) Kyoto protocol to the United Nations framework convention on climate change, United Nations, , [New York, USA]; (2014) World energy outlook 2014, , IEA Publications, Paris, France; (2013) European bioenergy outlook; Carneiro, P., Ferreira, P., The economic, environmental and strategic value of biomass (2012) Renew Energy, 44 (0), pp. 17-22; Gil, M.V., Oulego, P., Casal, M.D., Pevida, C., Pis, J.J., Rubiera, F., Mechanical durability and combustion characteristics of pellets from biomass blends (2010) Bioresour Technol, 101 (22), pp. 8859-8867; Sluiter, J.B., Ruiz, R.O., Scarlata, C.J., Sluiter, A.D., Templeton, D.W., Compositional analysis of lignocellulosic feedstocks. 1.

There are, however, still a lot of inaccuracies with regard to the dynamics of C in the soil, and thus with the potential to sequester soil C in these bioenergy crops. Using experimental data observed at the intensively monitored short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) plantation of the POPFULL project, we demonstrate that frequently neglected C pools and fluxes can be of crucial importance for the soil C balance. We highlight three specific cases. First, C inputs into the soil due to weed roots may equal or exceed those due to poplar fine roots, especially during the establishment phase of the plantation. Secondly, harvesting influences the dynamics of above- and belowground C inputs, as well as the soil environment. Large amounts of C are stored in the belowground woody biomass, which represents a long-term C pool. Thirdly, spatial differences related to the planting design are an important source of error in the upscaling of soil variables. We call upon researchers to consider and measure these neglected C pools and fluxes. © 2014 The Authors.","Belowground biomass; Bioenergy crop; DOC; Harvesting; Populus sp.; Weeds","Hansen, E.A., Poplar woody biomass yields - a look to the future (1991) Biomass Bioenergy, 1, p. 1; Blanco-Canqui, H., Crop residue removal for bioenergy reduces soil carbon pools: how can we offset carbon losses?

Aerosol optical and microphysical properties were measured in a Mediterranean urban area (Rome) at sites impacted by BC sources including fossil fuels (FF), and biomass burning (BB). Experimental BC data were interpreted through measurement-constrained simulations of BC microphysics and optical properties. A ""scheme"" to separate the ultrafine BC was experimented on the basis of the relation found between changes in the BC partitioning between Aitken and accumulation mode particles, and relevant changes in particle size distribution and optical properties of the bulk aerosol. This separation scheme, applied to experimental data, proved useful to reveal the impact of airport and road traffic emissions. Findings may have important atmospheric implications. The experimented scheme can help separating different BC sources (FF, BB, ""aged"" BC) when BC size distributions may be very difficult to obtain (satellite, columnar observations, routine monitoring). Indeed, separating the ultrafine BC from the fine BC may provide significant benefits in addressing BC impact on air quality and climate. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Airport; Black carbon; Mediterranean; Single Scattering Albedo; Ultrafine BC; Urban areas","Adler, G., Riziq, A.A., Erlick, C., Rudich, Y., Effect of intrinsic organic carbon on the optical properties of fresh diesel soot (2010) Proc.

In this study, samples of fine particulate matter emissions with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5μm (PM2.5) were collected for 12-hour periods during the spring and fall of 2011 and 2012. Eighty-three samples were analyzed for organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC). The carbonaceous fraction (OC+EC) accounted for 28-55% of the PM2.5 mass. The average OC/EC ratios ranged from 7.4 to 12.6, and OC and EC concentrations were statistically significant correlated (R2=0.81, p&lt;0.01). The secondary organic aerosol (SOA) contributions were determined using two approaches: the EC tracer method based on a primary OC/EC ratio derived from a tunnel study and the minimum observed OC/EC ratio. SOAs were determined to constitute, on average, 59-87% and 32-45% of the total OC and PM2.5, respectively. The relationship between O3 and wind speed indicated that pollutant levels were influenced by transport events during the spring, while stagnation events predominated during the fall campaigns. Statistically significant correlations were observed between OC and EC and gaseous species (CO, NOx, and SO2), indicating a contribution by combustion of fossil fuels to the carbonaceous material. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric aerosols; EC tracer method; Monterrey; PM2.5; Secondary organic aerosols","Aiken, A.C., DeCarlo, P.F., Kroll, J.H., Worsnop, D.R., Huffman, J.A., Docherty, K.S., Ulbrich, I.M., Jimenez, J.L., O/C and OM/OC ratios of primary, secondary, and ambient organic aerosols with high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometry (2008) Sci.

However, the effects of adding an alcohol to a petrochemical fuel are yet to be fully understood. We report Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of ethanol/gasoline mixtures with systematically varied composition. Frequency shifts and excess infrared absorbance are analyzed in order to investigate the mixture behavior at the molecular level. The spectroscopic data suggest that the hydrogen bonding between ethanol molecules is weakened upon gasoline addition, but the hydrogen bonds do not disappear. This can be explained by a formation of small ethanol clusters that interact via Van der Waals forces with the surrounding gasoline molecules. Furthermore, approaches for measuring the chemical composition of ethanol/gasoline blends by FTIR are discussed. For a simplistic approach based on the Beer-Lambert relation, an optimized set of parameters for quantitative measurements are determined. The best compromise between measurement sensitivity and accuracy is found for the CO stretching mode of the alcohol. For the traditional method of calibrating the ratio of integrated band intensities of the CH and OH stretching regions it is found that narrowing the spectral window of the CH stretch can significantly improve the measurement sensitivity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, the role of oxygen defects and acidity of transition metal oxides during steam reforming of ethanol and hydrodeoxygenation of carboxylic acids are discussed. It is found that steam reforming of ethanol requires more oxygen defects with high mobility but less acidity while biofuel production by hydrodeoxygenation requires relatively strong acidity and/or moderate metal-oxygen bond strength in the transition metal oxides. The finding provides new opportunities for revealing the relationship of structures and catalytic performance, and insights in the rational design of transition metal oxides as catalysts or supports for renewable energy and fuel production. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The mixing ratio of carbon dioxide (CO2) and its influencing factors in urban Nanjing were investigated in this study, from the 18th of January to the 31st of December 2011. The annual average mixing ratio of CO2 was 406.5±20.0ppmv over the study period. The signal analysis using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm showed that CO2 had different cycles as a result of multiple controlling factors. The seasonal and intra-seasonal fluctuations of CO2 were mainly caused by the terrestrial biospheric uptake and emission and atmospheric oscillation. The weekly variation of CO2 was largely influenced by traffic volume. The diurnal cycle of CO2 presented a bimodal pattern in winter (DJF) probably due to the rush hour emissions. The seasonal mean CO2/CO correlation slope varied from 0.024ppmv/ppbv to 0.029ppmv/ppbv, comparable to the fossil fuel combustion emission ratio. The diurnal pattern of CO2/CO was irregular, indicating random anthropogenic emissions in an urban area. Firework setting was a large source of CO2 during the Spring Festival holiday. The backward trajectories by the HYSPLIT model showed that the local anthropogenic emissions contributed the most to the high CO2 mixing ratio in the urban area. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2); Firework settings; The CO2/CO ratio; Traffic emissions; Urban Nanjing","Artuso, F., Chamard, P., Piacentino, S., Influence of transport and trends in atmospheric CO2 at Lampedusa (2009) Atmos.
