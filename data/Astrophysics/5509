Using the Darmois-Israel formalism the dynamical analysis of Reissner Nordstrom de-Sitter thin shell wormholes, at the wormhole throat, are determined by considering linearized radial perturbations around static solutions. The region of stability in the presence of a large value of charge is significantly increased. Also, the region of stability in the presence of a positive large value of cosmological constant is significantly increased. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
