We consider here the general conditions for the stability of brane stars that obey a so called a minimal setup: the nonlocal anisotropic stress and energy flux are absent everywhere, and the only permitted Weyl correction is the interior solution of the nonlocal energy density. Along with a series of simple conditions, we show that the Germani-Maartens solution with a constant density sets up the upper bound for the compactness of that particular class of brane stars. The general demonstration is based upon the properties of the interior solutions of the stars, although we also show that the minimal setup implies a Schwarzschild exterior.
