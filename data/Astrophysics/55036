Partial cross sections of the Y89(p,γ)Zr90 reaction have been measured to investigate the γ-ray strength function in the neutron-magic nucleus 90Zr. For five proton energies between E<inf>p</inf>=3.65MeV and E<inf>p</inf>=4.70MeV, partial cross sections for the population of seven discrete states in 90Zr have been determined by means of in-beam γ-ray spectroscopy. Since these γ-ray transitions are dominantly of E1 character, the present measurement allows an access to the low-lying dipole strength in 90Zr. A γ-ray strength function based on the experimental data could be extracted, which is used to describe the total and partial cross sections of this reaction by Hauser-Feshbach calculations successfully. Significant differences with respect to previously measured strength functions from photoabsorption data point towards deviations from the Brink-Axel hypothesis relating the photo-excitation and de-excitation strength functions. © 2015 The Authors.
