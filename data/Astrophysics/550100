The 7Be(p, γ)8B reaction plays a central role not only in the evaluation of solar neutrino fluxes but also in the evolution of the first stars. Study of this reaction requires the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) for the virtual decay 8Bg.s. → 7Be + p. By using the charge symmetry relation, we obtain this proton ANC with the single neutron ANC of 8Lig.s. →7Li + n, which is determined with the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) and adiabatic distorted wave approximation (ADWA) analysis of the 7Li(d, p)8Li angular distribution. The astrophysical S-factors and reaction rates of the direct capture process in the 7Be(p, γ)8B reaction are further deduced at energies of astrophysical relevance. The astrophysical S-factor at zero energy for direct capture, S17(0), is derived to be (19.9 ± 3.5) eV b in good agreement with the most recent recommended value. The contributions of the 1+ and 3+ resonances to the S-factor and reaction rate are also evaluated. The present result demonstrates that the direct capture dominates the 7Be(p, γ)8B reaction in the whole temperature range. This work provides an independent examination to the current results of the 7Be(p, γ)8B reaction. © 2015 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg
