Asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANCs) are fundamental nuclear constants playing an important role in nuclear physics and astrophysics. We derive a new useful relationship between ANCs of the Gamow radial wave function and the renormalized (due to the Coulomb interaction) Coulomb-nuclear partial scattering amplitude. We use an analytical approximation in the form of a series for the nonresonant part of the phase shift which can be analytically continued to the point of an isolated resonance pole in the complex plane of the momentum. Earlier, this method which we call the S-matrix pole method was used by us to find the resonance pole energy. We find the corresponding fitting parameters for the He5,Li5, and O16 concrete resonance states. Additionally, based on the theory of the effective range, we calculate the parameters of the p3/2 and p1/2 resonance states of the nuclei He5 and Li5 and compare them with the results obtained by the S-matrix pole method. ANC values are found which can be used to calculate the reaction rate through the O16 resonances which lie slightly above the threshold for the αC12 channel. © 2015 American Physical Society.
