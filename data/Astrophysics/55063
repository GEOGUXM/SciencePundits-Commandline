The 3He(α, γ)7Be nuclear reaction, which is of great interest for modern nuclear astrophysics, is investigated. The astrophysical S-factor of the reaction is calculated using the algebraic version of the resonating group model. The results agree with current experimental data. © 2015, Allerton Press, Inc.
