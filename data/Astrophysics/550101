Enormous progress has been made on observing stellar magnetism in stars from the main sequence (particularly thanks to the MiMeS, MAGORI and BOB surveys) through to compact objects. Recent data have thrown into sharper relief the vexed question of the origin of stellar magnetic fields, which remains one of the main unanswered questions in astrophysics. In this chapter we review recent work in this area of research. In particular, we look at the fossil field hypothesis which links magnetism in compact stars to magnetism in main sequence and pre-main sequence stars and we consider why its feasibility has now been questioned particularly in the context of highly magnetic white dwarfs. We also review the fossil versus dynamo debate in the context of neutron stars and the roles played by key physical processes such as buoyancy, helicity, and superfluid turbulence, in the generation and stability of neutron star fields.Independent information on the internal magnetic field of neutron stars will come from future gravitational wave detections. Coherent searches for the Crab pulsar with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) have already constrained its gravitational wave luminosity to be ≲2 % of the observed spin-down luminosity, thus placing a limit of ≲1016 G on the internal field. Indirect spin-down limits inferred from recycled pulsars also yield interesting gravitational-wave-related constraints. Thus we may be at the dawn of a new era of exciting discoveries in compact star magnetism driven by the opening of a new, non-electromagnetic observational window.We also review recent advances in the theory and computation of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence as it applies to stellar magnetism and dynamo theory. These advances offer insight into the action of stellar dynamos as well as processes which control the diffusive magnetic flux transport in stars. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht
