The C12(α,γ)O16 reaction plays a fundamental role in astrophysics and needs to be known with accuracy better than 10%. Cascade γ transitions through the excited states of O16 are contributing to the uncertainty. We constrained the contribution of the 0+ (6.05 MeV) and 3- (6.13 MeV) cascade transitions by measuring the asymptotic normalization coefficients for these states using the α-transfer reaction 6Li(12C,d)16O at sub-Coulomb energy. The contribution of the 0+ and 3- cascade transitions at 300 keV is found to be 1.96±0.3 and 0.12±0.04keVb for destructive interference of the direct and resonance capture and 4.36±0.45 and 1.44±0.12keVb for constructive interference, respectively. The combined contribution of the 0+ and 3- cascade transitions to the 12C(α,γ)16O reaction cross section at 300 keV does not exceed 4%. Significant uncertainties have been dramatically reduced. © 2015 American Physical Society.
