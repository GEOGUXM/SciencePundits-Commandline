Regulation of magnetism and half-metallicity has attracted much attention because of its potential in spintronics. The magnetic properties and electronic structure of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C4N3) with external strain are determined theoretically based on the density function theory and many-body perturbation theory (G0W0). Asymmetric deformation induced by uniaxial strain not only regulates the magnetic characteristics but also leads to a transformation from half-metallicity to metallicity. However, this transition cannot occur in the structure with symmetric deformation induced by biaxial strain. Our results suggest the use of strain engineering in metal-free spintronics applications.
