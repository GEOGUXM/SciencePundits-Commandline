Shell model studies have contributed in recent years significantly to improve nuclear input required in simulations of the dynamics of astrophysical objects and their associated nucleosynthesis. This manuscript highlights a few examples like electron capture rates of importance for the evolution of core-collapse supernovae and the nucleosynthesis in thermonuclear supernovae, neutrino-nucleus cross sections with relevance to the supernova neutrino spectra and finally half lives of neutron-rich nuclei with magic neutron numbers which serve as waiting points in the mass flow of the astrophysical r-process.
