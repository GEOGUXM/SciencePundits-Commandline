We are developing kilo-pixel arrays of transition-edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeters for use in future laboratory and space based X-ray astrophysics experiments. These arrays are required to achieve an energy resolution of Δ EFWHM &lt; 3eV full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) in the soft X-ray energy range. In this contribution we report on the development of 32 × 32 arrays of Mo/Au TESs with Bi/Au X-ray absorbers. We present measurements from 8 × 8 test arrays and 32 × 32 uniform arrays. Measurements of the bias point resistance and magnetic field dependence of the transition properties show that by carefully tuning the applied magnetic field the requirements on TC and magnetic field uniformity can be reduced whilst maintaining the target energy resolution. Results show Δ EFWHM ∼ 2.0-2.5 eV FWHM at a photon energy of 6 keV, measured across several pixels. Despite larger than typical TC variation across the detector, time division multiplexed readout of 30 common electrically biased pixels in the 32 × 32 array (in a 2 column × 16 row configuration) show an average Δ EFWHM = 3.0 ± 0.3eV. © 2014 IEEE.
