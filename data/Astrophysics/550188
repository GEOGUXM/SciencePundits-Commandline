In October 2013 Italy enacted Law n.112/2013, containing the first national regulations about the open-access availability of publicly-funded research results (publications). The impact of these new regulations with the specific situation of that open-access pioneering discipline which is astrophysics, has been considered. Under a strictly technical point of view, in the light of the new dispositions the open nature of a part of the astrophysical scholarly literature which has been made available online free to the reader during the last twenty years, might be questionable. In astrophysics, most of the journal articles are published by a very small number of scientific societies and organizations. The copyright policies of these major publishing bodies have been collected and analyzed, with regard to the main requirements of the Italian law about open access. Most of these policies are sufficiently liberal for an entirely compliant open access to be provided and scientists would benefit from knowing these details more extensively. Some possible ways to make astrophysicists' scholarly dissemination entirely compliant with the Italian law requirements are considered.
