On the basis of the torque correlation model for the Gilbert damping constant α, we perform the first principles calculation for α for Co-based Heusler alloys, Co2MnAl (CMA), Co2MnSi (CMS), and Co2FeSi (CFS). In the ordered (L21) and partially disordered (B2) structures, the calculated values of α reflect half-metallicity or the gap structure around the Fermi level, EF, i.e. CMS with 100% spin-polarization has the smallest value. The valence electron number dependence of α follows the experimental trend. However, the calculated values are almost a factor of ten smaller than the measured ones. Although the α values are larger in the completely disordered (A2) structure, they are not as large as the experimental results. Therefore, the decreasing degree of order or the breakdown of the half-metallicity is not responsible for the discrepancy. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.
