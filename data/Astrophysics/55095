Accurate knowledge about the neutron skin thickness ΔRnp in Pb208 has far-reaching implications for different communities of nuclear physics and astrophysics. Yet, the novel lead radius experiment (PREX) did not yield any stringent constraint on ΔRnp recently. We employ a more practicable strategy to probe the neutron skin thickness of Pb208 based on a high linear correlation between the ΔRnp and J-asym, where J and asym are the symmetry energy (coefficient) of nuclear matter at saturation density and of Pb208. An accurate J-asym thus places a strong constraint on the ΔRnp. Compared with the parity-violating asymmetry APV in the PREX, the reliably experimental information on the J-asym is much more easily available thanks to the wealth of measured data on nuclear masses and decay energies. The density dependence of the symmetry energy is also well constrained with the J-asym. Finally, with a "tomoscan" method, we find that one just needs to measure the nucleon densities in Pb208 starting from Rm=7.61±0.04 fm to obtain the ΔRnp in hadron scattering experiments, regardless of its interior profile being hampered by strong absorption. © 2015 American Physical Society.
