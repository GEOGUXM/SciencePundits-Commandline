This paper provides an overview of the present questions, goals, and challenges in the field of experimental nuclear astrophysics. A number of different stellar environments and the associated conditions for nuclear-reactions-driven nucleosynthesis events and patterns are discussed. Experimental goals are presented and specific activities and initiatives are summarized for each of these burning environments. New facilities are under development and will help to provide a sound experimental base for understanding the evolution of the elements in our Universe. Copyright Â© EPLA, 2015.
