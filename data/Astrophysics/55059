Helioseismology has advanced considerably our knowledge of the interior of the Sun over the past three decades. Our understanding of the Sun’s internal structure, its dynamics, rotation, convection and magnetism, have all been advanced. Yet there are challenges, areas where the results from helioseismology are tantalizing but inconclusive, and aspects where the interpretation of the data has still to be put on a firm footing. In this paper we shall focus on a number of those challenges and give our assessment of where progress needs to be made in the next decade. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht
