Future space-mission concepts currently discussed in the helioseismology community are reviewed. One popular idea is to observe the Sun from high latitudes, to explore the polar regions as well as to probe the deep interior using stereoscopic techniques, by combining observations from high latitudes with observations from within the ecliptic plane. Another idea is to stay within the ecliptic plane but still aim for stereoscopic helioseismology for deep layers. A new instrument and a novel mission concept for studying the solar core regions are also discussed. Â© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht
