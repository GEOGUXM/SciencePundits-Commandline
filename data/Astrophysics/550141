Properties of the experimentally inaccessible N=82 isotones below 132Sn have been a major open question for nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics. Evolution of the neutron N=82 shell gap along this isotonic chain with even proton numbers 36-48 is investigated by large-scale shell model calculations, which allow core excitations across both the N=82 neutron and Z=50 proton shell gaps. It is found that when moving away from 132Sn, the N=82 shell gap, measured by the excited 2+ states with the neutron core-excited configurations, decreases gradually due to the monopole interaction acting dynamically between the πg9/2 and νh11/2 orbits. At 120Sr, the neutron core-excited configuration is sufficiently low and becomes the dominant component in the first excited 2+ state, which results in a quenching of the Z=40 subshell. Measurement of E2 transition probabilities in 120Sr is proposed to confirm this novel shell-quenching mechanism. © 2015 American Physical Society.
