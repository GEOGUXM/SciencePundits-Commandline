Hinode/EIS observations have revealed outflows near active regions which remain unexplained. An outflow region observed by the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) that appears slightly redshifted at low temperatures and blueshifted at higher temperatures is presented. We conduct simulations and use those to create synthetic line profiles in order to replicate the observed line profiles of an apparent open structure. The results of the forward modelling support a scenario whereby long loops consisting of multiple strands undergo a cyclical process of heating and cooling on timescales of approximately 80 min.
