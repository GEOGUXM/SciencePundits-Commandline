SummaryThe availability of large-scale digital surveys offers tremendous opportunities for advancing scientific knowledge in the astrophysics community. Nevertheless, the analysis of these data often requires very powerful computational resources. Science gateway technologies offer Web-based environments to run applications with little concern for learning and managing the underlying infrastructures that execute them. This paper focuses on the issues related to the development of a science gateway customized for the needs of the astrophysics community. The VisIVO Science Gateway is wrapped around a WS-PGRADE/grid User Support Environment portal integrating services for processing and visualizing large-scale multidimensional astrophysical data sets on distributed computing infrastructures. We discuss the core tools and services supported including an application for mobile access to the gateway. We report our experiences in supporting specialized astrophysical communities requiring development of complex workflows for visualization and numerical simulations. Further, available platforms are discussed for sharing workflows in collaborative environments. Finally, we outline our vision for creating a federation of science gateways to benefit astrophysical communities by sharing a set of services for authentication, computing infrastructure access and data/workflow repositories.
