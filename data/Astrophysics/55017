First-principle calculations are employed to study the electronic structures and magnetic properties of XN<inf>3</inf> (X = Na, K and Rb) compounds with DO<inf>3</inf> structure. It is found that XN<inf>3</inf> (X = Na, K and Rb) compounds are d0 half-metals with an integer magnetic moment of 2 μ<inf>B</inf> in their ferrimagnetic ground states. It is the spin polarization of p electrons of N elements that leads to an atomic magnetic moment, ferrimagnetism and half-metallicity in XN<inf>3</inf> (X = Na, K and Rb) compounds. The half-metallicity of XN<inf>3</inf> (X = Na, K and Rb) compounds can be kept in a quite large hydrostatic strain and tetragonal distortion. Also, we reveal that the half-metallicity can be preserved when the Coulomb interactions are considered. In addition, the calculated electronic structures of surface show that both N(A)-N(C) and N(B)-K/Rb terminated (0 0 1) surfaces maintain the half-metallicity for KN<inf>3</inf> and RbN<inf>3</inf> compounds. For NaN<inf>3</inf> compound, the N(A)-N(C) terminated (0 0 1) surface preserves the half-metallic characteristics, however, the half-metallic gap in the majority spin direction is destroyed by the N(B)-Na terminated (0 0 1) surface. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
