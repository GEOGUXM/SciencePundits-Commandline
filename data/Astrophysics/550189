Highly-monochromatic γ-ray beams are produced at the NewSUBARU synchrotron radiation facility by the inverse Compton scattering of laser photons from relativistic electrons. The latest s-process study in nuclear astrophysics with the γ-ray beam is presented. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.
