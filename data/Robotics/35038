Robotic dance is an important topic in the field of social robotics. Its research has a vital significance to both humans and robotics. This paper presents a review of the state of the art in robotic dance. Robotic dance is classified into four categories: cooperative human-robot dance, imitation of human dance motions, synchronization for music, and creation of robotic choreography. The research methods in each category are discussed. Future research areas are highlighted. Â© 2015 IEEE.
