The acetabular labrum provides mechanical stability to the hip joint in extreme positions where the femoral head is disposed to subluxation. We aimed to quantify the isolated labrum's stabilizing value. Five human cadaveric hips were mounted to a robotic manipulator, and subluxation potential tests were run with and without labrum. Three-dimensional (3D) kinematic data were quantified using the stability index (Colbrunn et al., 2013, "Impingement and Stability of Total Hip Arthroplasty Versus Femoral Head Resurfacing Using a Cadaveric Robotics Model," J. Orthop. Res., 31(7), pp. 1108-1115). Global and regional stability indices were significantly greater with labrum intact than after total labrectomy for both anterior and posterior provocative positions. In extreme positions, the labrum imparts significant overall mechanical resistance to hip subluxation. Regional stability contributions vary with joint orientation. Copyright Â© 2015 by ASME.
