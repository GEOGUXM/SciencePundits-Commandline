Matrix relations for kinematics and dynamics analysis of a spatial two-module Stewart-based hybrid parallel robot are established in this paper. Knowing the relative motions of two moving platforms, the inverse dynamics problem is solved based on a set of recursive explicit equations. Finally, compact results and graphs of simulation for the input forces and powers of all actuators are obtained. Â© 2015 Taylor & Francis and The Robotics Society of Japan
