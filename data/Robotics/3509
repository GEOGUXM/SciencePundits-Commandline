The use of hyper-elastic polymers for the development of oft sensors with large deformation capabilities is described here. Using soft silicone elastomer (Ecoflex 00-50) and liquid metal alloy (Galinstan), we present the characterization of an electrofluidic strain sensor. The originality of such sensor lies in the capability to resist to large deformation (higher than 200% cycled 150 times). Several device designs have been investigated to enhance the electrical response of the sensor as a function of its elongation. We discuss here the results of cyclic deformation and strain on the sensor. We also present a theoretical study based on a numerical simulation performed with COMSOL Multi-Physics and an analytical model of the sensor's response to elongation. Numerical simulations were done based on the Mooney-Rivlin model for hyper-elastic materials. The analytical calculations were obtained considering the evolution of the sensor resistance according to the variations of the channel's dimensions. The two methods have shown a very good correlation with the experimental results. They offer new possibilities to design and prototype sensors suitable for application involving large deformation such as soft robots or wearable sensors to monitor physiological parameters.
