In this paper a novel error analysis on the well-known “stereo vision” system used in robots is presented. Based on this analysis, a new concept called the “lucid workspace” is introduced. Definition of such an area in the robot workspace is useful in vision system design. It enables us to know a priori the area that the robot can see in a crystal clear manner, so the designer can select the specifications and relative position of the vision system cameras to cover the needs. First, the basic two-camera triangulation equations are used to calculate a 3D object position, error propagation equations are derived by taking the appropriate partial derivatives with respect to all measurement errors. Next, using the applicable assumptions, two theorems are obtained and a new algorithm for determination of the lucid workspace is presented by using them. The performance of the new algorithm is verified using Monte Carlo simulations. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
