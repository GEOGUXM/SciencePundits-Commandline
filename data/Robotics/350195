This paper proposes a control scheme applied to the delayed bilateral teleoperation of mobile robots with force feedback in face of asymmetric and time-varying delays. The scheme is managed by a velocity PD-like control plus impedance and a force feedback based on damping and synchronization error. A fictitious force, depending on the robot motion and its environment, is used to avoid possible collisions. In addition, the stability of the system is analyzed from which simple conditions for the control parameters are established in order to assure stability. Finally, the performance of the delayed teleoperation system is shown through experiments where a human operator drives a mobile robot. Copyright Â© Cambridge University Press 2015
