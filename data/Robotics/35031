We developed a robust HTS-SQUID magnetometer utilizing bicrystal SrTiO3 substrates, single-layer YBa2 Cu3O7-x films and flip-chip technique, aiming for movable robot-based NDE system in unshielded environment. Robustness in the unshielded environment was achieved by coverage of the SQUID magnetometer with another cross-shaped HTS film in flip-chip configuration, and introduction of mesh structure in both the magnetometer and the HTS film. SQUID parameters, such as critical current 2Ic, resistance Rn2, modulation voltage depth Vpp, and flux noise SΦ1/2, were measured in DC and AC fields. The SQUID magnetometer was rotated in unshielded environment, and moved by a robot arm, resulting in stable operation during the motion at 20 mm/s with active magnetic shielding technique. © 2014 IEEE.
