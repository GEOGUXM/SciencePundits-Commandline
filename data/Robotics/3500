Estimating the directions of arrival (DOAs) of multiple simultaneous mobile sound sources is an important step for various audio signal processing applications. In this contribution, we present an approach that improves upon our previous work that is now able to estimate the DOAs of multiple mobile speech sources, while being light in resources, both hardware-wise (only using three microphones) and software-wise. This approach takes advantage of the fact that simultaneous speech sources do not completely overlap each other. To evaluate the performance of this approach, a multi-DOA estimation evaluation system was developed based on a corpus collected from different acoustic scenarios named Acoustic Interactions for Robot Audition (AIRA).
