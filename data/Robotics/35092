Human gesture recognition to be a new type of natural user interface (NUI) using the person’s gesture action for operating the device is attracting much attention nowadays. In this study, an adaptive hidden Markov model (HMM)-based gesture recognition method with user adaptation (UA) using the Kinect camera to simplify large-scale video processing is designed to be the NUI of a humanoid robot device. The popular Kinect camera is employed for acquiring the gesture signals made by the active user, and the gesture action from the user can then be recognized and used to be as the control command for driving the humanoid robot to imitate the user’s actions. The large-scale video data can be reduced by the Kinect camera where the data from the Kinect camera for representing gesture signals includes the depth measurement information, and therefore only simple 3-axis coordinate information of the joints in a human skeleton is analyzed, categorized and managed in the developed system. By the presented scheme, the humanoid robot will imitate the human active gesture according to the content of the received gesture command. The well-known HMM pattern recognition method with the support of the Kinect device is explored to classify the human’s active gestures where a user adaptation scheme of MAP+GoSSRT that enhances MAP by incorporating group of states shifted by referenced transfer (GoSSRT) is proposed for adjusting HMM parameters, which will further increase the recognition accuracy of HMM gesture recognition. Human gesture recognition experiments for controlling the activity of the humanoid robot were performed on the indicated 14 classes of human active gestures. Experimental results demonstrated the superiority of the NUI by presented HMM gesture recognition with user adaptation for humanoid robot imitation applications. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
