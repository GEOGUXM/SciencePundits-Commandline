This article presents a tactile system for joint tracking in robotic laser welding with additional material in the form of wire and brazing, using the application example of the Scansonic ALO3 welding head. The construction and control system of a station with disc laser and robot are presented. The article describes the design and the control system of such a welding station constructed using a disc laser and an industrial robot. The study evaluates the influence of the basic parameters of the tracking system during welding and brazing of lap joints with thickness of up to 2 mm. © 2014 Taylor & Francis
