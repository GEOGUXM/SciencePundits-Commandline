In this paper, the forward kinematic analysis of 3-degree-of-freedom planar parallel robots with identical limb structures is presented. The proposed algorithm is based on Study's kinematic mapping (E. Study, “von den Bewegungen und Umlegungen,” Math. Ann. 39, 441–565 (1891)), resultant method, and the Gröbner basis in seven-dimensional kinematic space. The obtained solution in seven-dimensional kinematic space of the forward kinematic problem is mapped into three-dimensional Euclidean space. An alternative solution of the forward kinematic problem is obtained using resultant method in three-dimensional Euclidean space, and the result is compared with the obtained mapping result from seven-dimensional kinematic space. Both approaches lead to the same maximum number of solutions: 2, 6, 6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 6, 2, and 2 for the forward kinematic problem of planar parallel robots; 3-RPR, 3-RPR, 3-RRR, 3-RRR, 3-RRP, 3-RPP, 3-RPP, 3-PRR, 3-PRR, and 3-PRP, respectively.
