This paper describes and tests an approach to improve the temporal processing capabilities of the neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) algorithm. This algorithm is quite popular within the robotics community for the production of trained neural networks without having to determine a priori their size and topology. The main drawback of the traditional NEAT algorithm is that, even though it can implement recurrent synaptic connections, which allow it to perform some time related processing tasks, its capabilities are rather limited, especially when dealing with precise time dependent phenomena. NEAT’s ability to capture the underlying dynamics that correspond to complex time series still has a lot of room for improvement. To address this issue, the paper describes a new implementation of the NEAT algorithm that is able to generate artificial neural networks (ANNs) with trainable time delayed synapses in addition to its previous capacities. We show that this approach, called (Formula presented.)-NEAT improves the behavior of the neural networks obtained when dealing with complex time related processes. Several examples are presented, both dealing with the generation of ANNs that are able to produce complex theoretical signals such as chaotic signals or real data series, as in the case of the monthly number of international airline passengers or monthly (Formula presented.) concentrations. In these examples, (Formula presented.)-NEAT clearly improves over the traditional NEAT algorithm in these tasks. A final example of the integration of this approach within a robot cognitive mechanism is also presented, showing the clear improvements it could provide in the modeling required for many cognitive processes. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
