This paper proposes a neural control integrating stereo vision feedback for driving a mobile robot. The proposed approach consists in synthesizing a suitable inverse optimal control to avoid solving the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation associated to nonlinear system optimal control. The mobile robot dynamics is approximated by an identifier using a discrete-time recurrent high order neural network, trained with an extended Kalman filter algorithm. The desired trajectory of the robot is computed during navigation using a stereo camera sensor. Simulation and experimental result are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. Â© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
