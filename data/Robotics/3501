This work is motivated by the overestimation of chip formation contribution due to the unspecified proportion of ploughing and chip formation in previous studies on mechanisms of belt grinding. In this paper, a microscopic scale of ploughing force model is introduced, and the characterisation of cutting mechanisms generated by robot-assisted belt grinding of titanium alloys is provided from the energetic aspect based on experimental forces. It has been demonstrated that sliding is more predominant than ploughing and chip formation in robot-assisted belt grinding process, resulting in lower energy efficiency. Strategies for balancing energy consumption and energy efficiency are suggested. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
