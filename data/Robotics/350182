In this paper, a robust H<inf>2</inf>/H<inf>∞</inf> control with regional Pole-Placement is considered for tool position control of a nonlinear uncertain flexible robot manipulator. The uncertain nonlinear system is first approximated by Takagi and Sugeno’s (T–S) fuzzy model. To achieve a better tracking, an extra state (error of tracking) is then augmented to the T–S model. Based on each local linear subsystem with augmented state, a regional pole-placement state feedback H<inf>2</inf>/H<inf>∞</inf> controller is properly designed via linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. Parallel Distributed Compensation (PDC) is also used to establish the whole controller for the overall system and the total linear system is obtained by using the weighted sum of the local linear systems. A fuzzy weighted online computation (FWOC) component is employed to update fuzzy weights in real time for different operating points of the system. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller like robustness and good load disturbance attenuation and accurate tracking, even in the presence of parameter variations and also load disturbances on the motor and the tool. The superiority of the proposed control scheme is finally highlighted in comparison with the Quantitative feedback theory (QFT) controller, the QFT controller of order 13, a polynomial controller and the so-called linear sliding-mode controller methods. © 2015 Indian Academy of Sciences
