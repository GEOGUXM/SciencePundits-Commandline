This paper addresses the problem of trajectory tracking control in mobile robots under velocity limitations. Following the results reported in ref. [1], the problem of trajectory tracking considering control actions constraint is focused and the zero convergence of the tracking errors is demonstrated. In this work, the original methodology is expanded considering a controller that depends not only on the position but also on the velocity. A simple scheme is obtained, which can be easily implemented in others controllers of the literature. Experimental results are presented and discussed, demonstrating the good performance of the controller. Copyright Â© Cambridge University Press 2015
