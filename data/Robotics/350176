This paper describes the development of a motivating and innovative multi-robot formation control platform for laboratory experiments with mobile robots. The platform is composed of two components: a simulator and an environment to experiment with low cost wheeled mobile robots. The environment constitutes a ready to use test tool that provides to engineering students the opportunity to simulate and test many different formation and cooperation control strategies with a real system. Currently the platform is used in the Systems and Control Engineering Master program offered by the National University of Distance Education (UNED) and the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM) in Spain. The use of the platform exposes students to hands-on laboratory sessions, contributing to their development as engineers. Â© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht
