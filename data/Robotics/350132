With the advent of networked embedded control systems (NECSs) new opportunities and challenges have arisen. Among others, the challenges result mostly from variable communication delays, access constraints, and resource constraints. An event-based control and scheduling (EBCS) codesign strategy for NECSs involving a set of continuous-time LTI plants is proposed in this paper addressing all aforementioned challenges. A novel representation of the network-induced delay as an uncertain variable belonging to a finite set of different bounded intervals is further proposed. The transition from one bounded interval to another can be arbitrary or according to a stochastic process. Regarding the type of the transition and the resulting discrete-time switched polytopic system of the NECS, two versions of the EBCS problem are introduced: A robust EBCS problem under arbitrary transition and a stochastic EBCS problem under stochastic transition. Global uniform practical stability with guaranteed performance (measured by a quadratic cost function) is guaranteed for both versions after formulating them as LMI optimization problems. The effectiveness of the proposed EBCS strategy is illustrated along with a comparison between its versions for a set of mobile robots. Notably, the EBCS strategy is generally applicable to discrete-time switched polytopic systems. Â© 1963-2012 IEEE.
