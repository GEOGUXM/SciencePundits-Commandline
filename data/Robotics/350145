The paper proposes the mechanical design of a lockable spherical joint, which is designed to be manually or automatically configured in different kinematic solutions. The device is conceived for being used as a conventional spherical joint or converted in a universal joint, or still downgraded to a revolute pair. Therefore different configurations can be chosen according to user needs. In particular, two of the three axes of revolution, arranged in the typical roll-pitch-roll sequence of robot spherical wrists, can be locked alternately in order to provide two differently arranged universal joints. It can be demonstrated that such behavior allows to activate different mobilities of a class of reconfigurable parallel kinematics manipulators and for this task the device has been dimensioned. The transition between such mobilities occurs exploiting the concept of over-constrained kinematics, which is realized by the lockable joint during the switching phase in order to avoid an instantaneous mobility of the robot.
