Electromyography (EMG) is widely applied for neural engineering. For motion pattern recognition, many features of multi-channel EMG signals were investigated, but the relationships between muscles were not considered. In this study, a novel STFT-ranking feature based on short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is proposed. The novelty of STFT-ranking features is considering and covering the relationship information between EMG signals and multiple muscles in a motion pattern. With an exoskeleton robot arm, two series of motion patterns corresponding to the shoulder and elbow in the sagittal plane were investigated. EMG signals from six muscles were acquired in arm motion patterns when participants worn the robot arm. Four types of feature combinations, including seven conventional features, were compared with the STFT-ranking feature. The principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to build the motion recognition model. With the STFT-ranking feature, the recognition performance (93.9%) is superior to the conventional features (33.3-90.8%). The recognition variation is smaller (SD = 4.3%) than the other features tested (SD = 5.9-13.8%). These achievements will contribute to the advancement of control method of exoskeleton robots or power orthoses based on multi-channel EMG signals in the future. Based on the principle of STFT-ranking feature, the method also has potential for other multi-channel signal applications, such as electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing, speech recognition, and acoustic analysis.
