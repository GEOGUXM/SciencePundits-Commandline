One of the most serious security issues for collaborative work between robots and humans is the potential damage caused by unexpected collisions between them. Intrinsically-safe systems are a must in order to assure safety for both, the user and the robot, under the worst-case scenario of a total failure of the control subsystem. This work contributes to the field of passive mechanical system safety. The proposed security system consists in a flexible linkage that splits a robot arm link in two parts. Such a linkage allows the link to remain completely rigid as long as a given torque threshold is not exceeded, with that threshold being configurable according to working conditions and safety considerations. Both theoretical and experimental tests demonstrate a significant reduction in the accelerations and forces generated by impacts between the end effector of a robot arm equipped with the proposed mechanism and a simplified human head model.
