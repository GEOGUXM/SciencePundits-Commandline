In the presence of communication latency in a bilateral teleoperation system, stability and transparency are highly regarded. The major problem with teleoperation systems is complex dynamic and subsequently designing the controller. This essay presents a novel method of controller design, based on singular perturbation framework for the bilateral teleoperation of nonlinear robots through the Internet. Using this method makes it much easier to design the controller because controller designing is done for reduced-order subsystem not full-order system. In this paper, teleoperation system dynamics was decomposed into slave (slow subsystem) and error (fast subsystem, different from master and slave), which contains position and velocity, and an adaptive sliding mode controller was designed for each of them. For constant and time-varying delay, the positions of master–slave were compared together and controlling signal was applied to the slave; therefore, they could track each other in the shortest possible time. In the simulation, the stability and performance results of teleoperation system were obtained under the proposed controller and compared with those of another approach. In this research, having higher speed and lower control signal amplitude, at the same time, elucidates the absolute superiority of the new approach. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht
