In rapidly changing product structures and customer demands flexible manufacturing cells (FMC’s) are most widely used for meeting mid-volume, mid-variety production needs. They can process a variety of products in the same system and thus helps to achieve higher productivity. At the same time the components in FMC are more prone to failure because of their high operating rate. Further, it becomes more complex when components follow different failure distributions and it is difficult to plan suitable maintenance interventions. To this effect, in the present paper the authors present a hybrid framework by contemporaneous adoption of qualitative and quantitative techniques to model and analyze the failure aspects in FMC. On qualitative part potential failure modes w.r.t. various robot components are identified and risk priority number is obtained using failure mode and effect analysis. On quantitative analysis, use of Generalized Stochastic Petri Net is made and simulation experiments were carried out to model and analyze the performance of FMC (3 Machines 1 Robot). Cases of both reliable and unreliable FMC are investigated. © 2014, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.
