Abstract The development of robotic endoscopes is heading in the direction of intraluminal detection, but some features of the intestinal tract have hindered progress. This study aims to explore the frictional and viscous properties of the intestinal environment as encountered by expanding-extending robotic endoscopes in order to optimize the design of robotic endoscopy. Two models of intestinal deformation were built according to the different states between robot and intestine, and then the three axial forces experienced by robot were analyzed: Coulomb friction, marginal resistance, and viscous resistance. The proposed models were verified through a custom-made experimental platform, and the experimental results showed that the axial force of the robot body was between 0.1 and 0.4N; the anchoring force was obviously bigger than the force of the robot body if the anchoring diameter was 10mm larger than the diameter of intestine. In this paper, the effects of the axial motion mechanism's speed to the force of the robot body and anchoring mechanism were analyzed according to the models we built and the experimental results. The research helps further the study of the mechanical characteristics of the intestine and the development of robotic endoscope. Â© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York.
