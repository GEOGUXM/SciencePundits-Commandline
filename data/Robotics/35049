In this paper, we formulated a systematic design methodology for the design of planar six- and eight-bar slider mechanisms for motion generation applications that require more complex motion than the slider-crank mechanism. We show how two RR dyads can be synthesized and attached to planar PRR and PRR-3R chain for the dimensional synthesis of planar six- and eight-bar slider mechanisms, respectively. The results are 15 different types of one degree-of-freedom planar six- and eight-bar linkages with a prismatic joint at its base. We demonstrate the design process with the design of a multifunctional wheelchair that could transform its structure between a self-propelled wheelchair and a walking guide meant for outpatient rehabilitation purpose.
