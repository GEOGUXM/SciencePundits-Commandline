Menetrier’s disease, also known as hypoproteinemic hypertrophic gastropathy, is a rare condition characterized by the presence of gastric hypertrophy with foveolar infiltration that replaces the normal glandular architecture. We present a case of a 65-year-old female patient who had epigastric pain after meals which progressed to oral intolerance and weight loss. Upper endoscopy was performed showing prominent folds in the gastric mucosa and stenosis at the antrum–pylorus. Biopsy was taken and showed foveolar reactive hyperplasia and reactive glandular epithelium changes suggestive of Menetrier’s disease. An abdominopelvic CT was performed showing a dilated stomach and gastric wall thickening. The patient was taken into the operation room for a robot-assisted total gastrectomy with esophagus–jejunum anastomosis. The patient’s progress was satisfactory and he was discharged on the eighth postoperative day. Robot-assisted laparoscopic gastrectomy is a feasible and safe option that facilitates the performance of complex procedures. © 2015 Springer-Verlag London
