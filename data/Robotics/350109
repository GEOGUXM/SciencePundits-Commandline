R&D planning for emerging technologies that reflect customers' future needs has a crucial role in national economies. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical quality function deployment (QFD) framework that enables one to set R&D priorities and then develop corresponding business models to meet future societal needs. The proposed QFD framework consists of a hierarchical structure with three house-of-quality (HOQ) stages, which are based on patent analysis and opinions of specialists and generalists. Based on the results of the HOQ and the convergence of iterated correlation analysis, prospective technology was identified. We applied the proposed framework to robotics technology in Korea and found that, for robotics R&D, position sensors are the most important emerging technologies, followed by distance sensors and motor-driven technologies. In addition, by utilizing reverse QFD, we suggest business models for cleaning, entertainment, and pet robots. We expect this research to open a new avenue in the R&D planning process.
