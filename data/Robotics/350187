Purpose: We present a registration method for computer-assisted total hip replacement (THR) surgery, which we demonstrate to improve the state of the art by both reducing the invasiveness of current methods and increasing registration accuracy. A critical element of computer-guided procedures is the determination of the spatial correspondence between the patient and a computational model of patient anatomy. The current method for establishing this correspondence in robot-assisted THR is to register points intraoperatively sampled by a tracked pointer from the exposed proximal femur and, via auxiliary incisions, from the distal femur. Methods: In this paper, we demonstrate a noninvasive technique for sampling points on the distal femur using tracked B-mode ultrasound imaging and present a new algorithm for registering these data called Projected Iterative Most-Likely Oriented Point (P-IMLOP). Points and normal orientations of the distal bone surface are segmented from ultrasound images and registered to the patient model along with points sampled from the exposed proximal femur via a tracked pointer. Results: The proposed approach is evaluated using a bone- and tissue-mimicking leg phantom constructed to enable accurate assessment of experimental registration accuracy with respect to a CT-image-based model of the phantom. These experiments demonstrate that localization of the femur shaft is greatly improved by tracked ultrasound. The experiments further demonstrate that, for ultrasound-based data, the P-IMLOP algorithm significantly improves registration accuracy compared to the standard ICP algorithm. Conclusion: Registration via tracked ultrasound and the P-IMLOP algorithm has high potential to reduce the invasiveness and improve the registration accuracy of computer-assisted orthopedic procedures.
