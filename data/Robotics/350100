This work presents the design of an open educational low-cost (35 euros) modular and extendable mobile robot based on Android and Arduino, with Local Area Network (LAN) and Internet connection capabilities, to be used as an educational tool in labs and classrooms of information and communications technology (ICT) vocational training, or in engineering courses, as well as in e-learning or massive open online courses (MOOC) as an alternative or complementary to virtual labs. It is a first step introducing what we call ”BYOR: Bring Your Own Robot” education policy equivalent to ”BYOD: Bring your own devices” in computers’ world. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht
