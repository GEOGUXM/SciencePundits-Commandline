Historically, Spain has experienced relatively little public objection to wind power proposals, but this is changing in the region of Galicia, which now hosts a relatively concentrated level of wind turbines. To document and understand this objection, we take a cognitive mapping approach, commenting on its value as a method and focussing particularly on the issue of community compensation. Cognitive mapping structures the causal logic of individuals' thinking, revealing this and facilitating group discussion. Here we compare cognitive maps that reflect different positions on the controversy. Both monetary and in-kind compensation are dismissed by local campaigners and local stakeholder representatives alike. In-kind compensation is regarded as inadequate firstly because it cannot provide the scale of the public goods perceived as necessary by the host community. Secondly, the developer is in any case considered inappropriate as provider of public goods, which the community think should be delivered by local and regional governments. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
