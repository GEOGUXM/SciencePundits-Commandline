This paper proposes a new high-temperature superconductor (HTS) axial-field flux-switching machine with the merit of high power density for wind energy conversion. The key is to introduce a kind of modular racetrack cooling Dewar with static seals to replace the one with dynamic seals used in the conventional rotor excitation HTS machine. Also, the effects of rotor relative positions of the proposed machine on the back electromotive force are discussed. By using finite-element analysis, the machine performances are analyzed. Hence, the validity of the proposed machine is verified. Â© 2002-2011 IEEE.
