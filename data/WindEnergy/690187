A high output flexible piezoelectric generator based on a highly oriented BaTiO<inf>3</inf> film self-assembled using an interfacial strategy is reported. We have successfully controlled the morphology and orientation of BaTiO<inf>3</inf> particles and obtained a BaTiO<inf>3</inf> film using a facile interfacial self-assembled method. The BaTiO<inf>3</inf> film is transferred onto an ITO coated PET substrate and packaged with PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) to form a flexible piezoelectric energy harvesting device. The interfacial assembling strategy can effectively increase the volume fraction of active piezoelectric materials in composite films. The BaTiO<inf>3</inf> film-based piezoelectric generator was demonstrated to harvest wind energy by employing a windmill and the output power was large enough to light a LCD.
