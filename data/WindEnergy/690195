Extratropical cyclones, including winter westerly disturbances (WWD) over central Asia, are fundamental features of the atmosphere that maintain energy, momentum, and moisture at global scales while intimately linking large-scale circulation to regional-scale meteorology. Within high mountain Asia, WWD are the primary contributor to regional precipitation during winter. In this work, we present a novel WWD tracking methodology, which provides an inventory of location, timing, intensity, and duration of events, allowing for a comprehensive study of the factors that relate WWD to orographic precipitation, on an individual event basis and in the aggregate. We identify the relationship between the strength of disturbances, the state of the background environment during their propagation, and precipitation totals in the Karakoram/western Himalaya. We observe significant differences in convective and mechanical instability contributions to orographic precipitation as a function of the relationship between the intensity of WWD and the background temperature and moisture fields, which exhibit strong intraseasonal variability. Precipitation is primarily orographically forced during intense WWD with strong cross-barrier winds, while weaker WWD with similar precipitation totals are observed to benefit from enhanced instability due to high moisture content and temperature at low levels, occurring primarily in the late winter/premonsoon. The contribution of these factors is observed to fluctuate on a per-case basis, indicating important influences of intraseasonal oscillations and tropical-extratropical interactions on regional precipitation.
