The dynamic performance of a wind turbine drive train significantly influences the operation of an entire machine. In this work, a megawatt wind turbine drive train is subject to theoretical and experimental dynamic analysis. The method of rigid-flexible coupling multibody dynamics was applied to develop a dynamic model of the entire drive train. This model was then used to study the natural characteristics of the system. The blades, hub, main shaft, and speed-up gearbox in the dynamic model were modeled as flexible bodies. The potential resonances of the system were detected through Campbell and modal energy distribution analyses. Theoretical results show that the first-order natural frequency of the system is approximately 1.72 Hz. This frequency represents a torsional vibration mode, Moreover, resonances are not observed within the normal operating speed range of the drive train. An experimental remote real-time system was developed to monitor the torsional vibration of the drive train. This vibration was used to measure the torsional vibration of the system overall. The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical results. Â© 2015, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
