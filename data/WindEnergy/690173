The headway of wind power generation is a great blessing to help meet up the electrical power demand day by day. The strongest challenges for wind energy conversion system (WECS) are to handle the intermittency of wind and to maintain the grid reliability. The power electronics and energy storage systems are essential elements of the WECS. This paper attempts to provide various new directions to the future wind energy researchers to improve the wind turbine aerodynamics, electric generators' configurations with improved control of power electronics and lower cost energy storage system for designing a reliable wind turbine generator system. This study will work as a guideline for the researchers to understand the development and requirement of a reliable and smart wind energy conversion system. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
