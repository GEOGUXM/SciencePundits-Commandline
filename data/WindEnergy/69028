This paper addresses the use of variable structure control (i.e., sliding mode (SM) control) for improving the dynamic performance of a low-power wind energy conversion system (WECS) that is connected to a dc grid. The SM control is applied to simultaneously match 1) the maximum power generation of the wind turbine system from the wind with 2) the maximum power injection of the grid-connected power converter into the grid. The amount of energy extractable from a dynamically changing wind using the WECS with SM control is compared with that of classic PI control. Both the simulation and experimental results show that more energy can be harvested with the SM control as compared to the PI control for any dynamically changing or random wind conditions.
