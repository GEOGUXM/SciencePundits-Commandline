A fast integrated method for the measurement of solar reflectance of building's envelope components was developed. The method is based on a solar simulator and two pyranometers setup in a wind tunnel of controllable environmental conditions. The geometry was calibrated by spectralon standards and its validity was tested by measurements comparison with two standard methods of solar reflectance determination (ASTM standards E903-96 and E1918-06). A very good agreement was found and the developed method was applied for typical building's envelope components like cements, marbles, plaster, reflective paint. The method was also implemented for the solar reflectance determination of a specific NIR reflective compound of the form of calcium carbonate. Coupling of the reflectometer with the monitoring of additional solar-matter interaction processes extends its applicability as a precise, integrated and less time consuming method towards the characterization of "cool" materials.
