This paper presents a study on the design of linear model predictive control (MPC) for wind turbines, with a focus on the controller's tuning tradeoffs. A continuously linearized MPC approach is described and applied to control a 3-bladed, horizontal axis, variable speed wind turbine. The tuning involves a multiobjective cost function so that the performance can be optimized with respect to five defined measures: power variation, pitch usage, tower displacement, drivetrain twist and frequency of violating the nominal power limit. A tuning approach based on the computation of sensitivity tables is proposed and tested via numerical simulations using a nonlinear turbine model. The paper further compares the performance of the MPC controller with that of a conventional one. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
