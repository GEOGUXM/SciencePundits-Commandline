In this paper, we present a new contribution for the control of Wind-turbine energy systems, a nonlinear robust control of active and reactive power by the use of the Adaptative Backstepping approach based in double-fed asynchronous generator (DFIG-Generator).Initially, a control strategy of the MPPT for extraction of maximum power of the turbine generator is presented. Thereafter, a new control technique for wind systems is presented. This control system is based on an adaptive pole placement control approach integrated to a Backstepping control system. The stability of the system is shown using Lyapunov technique. Using the FPGA to implement the order gives us a better rapidity. A Benchmark was realized by a prototyping platform based on DFIG-generator, FPGA and wind-turbine; the experimental results obtained show the effectiveness and the benefit of our contribution.
