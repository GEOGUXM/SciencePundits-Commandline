Photovoltaic panels used for power generation are subject to significant wind loads of concern to mounting systems. A novel method of arranging photovoltaic surface in layers of non-overlapping panels is proposed for tracking systems to reduce wind load forces. The potential of this approach is assessed for double layer systems called DLOOP using Computational Fluid Dynamic turbulence modelling and wind tunnel tests.A consistent pattern of wind-force reduction is found as distance between double layers is increased up to and beyond the scale of the integrated panels' side length.A 49 panel DLOOP arrangement when tested in high winds had the potential to carry 30% more panels than a single layer arrangement of side by side panels for equivalent wind loading.
