Energy harvesting based on tethered kites benefits from exploiting higher wind speeds at higher altitudes. The setup considered in this paper is based on a pumping cycle. It generates energy by winching out at high tether forces, driving an electrical generator while flying crosswind. Then it winches in at a stationary neutral position, thus leaving a net amount of generated energy.The focus of this paper is put on the flight control design, which implements an accurate direction control towards target points and allows for a flight with an eight-down pattern. An extended overview on the control system approach, as well as details of each element of the flight controller, is presented. The control architecture is motivated by a simple, yet comprehensive model for the kite dynamics.In addition, winch strategies based on an optimization scheme are presented. In order to demonstrate the real world functionality of the presented algorithms, flight data from a fully automated pumping-cycle operation of a small-scale prototype are given. The setup is based on a 30m2 kite linked to a ground-based 50kW electrical motor/generator by a single line. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
