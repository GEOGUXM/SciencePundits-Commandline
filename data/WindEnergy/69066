The contribution of foundation damping to offshore wind turbines (OWTs) is not well known, though researchers have back-calculated foundation damping from "rotor-stop" tests after estimating aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, and structural damping with numerical models. Because design guidelines do not currently recommend methods for determining foundation damping, it is typically neglected. This paper investigates the significance of foundation damping on monopile-supported OWTs subjected to extreme storm loading using a linear elastic two-dimensional finite element model. The effect of foundation damping primarily on the first natural frequency of the OWT was considered as OWT behavior is dominated by the first mode under storm loading. A simplified foundation model based on the soil-pile mudline stiffness matrix was used to represent the monopile, hydrodynamic effects were modeled via added hydrodynamic mass, and 1.00% Rayleigh structural damping was assumed. Hysteretic energy loss in the foundation was converted into a viscous, rotational dashpot at the mudline to represent foundation damping. Using the logarithmic decrement method on a finite element free vibration time history, 0.17%-0.28% of critical damping was attributed to foundation damping. Stochastic time history analysis of extreme storm conditions indicated that mudline OWT foundation damping decreases the maximum and standard deviation of mudline moment by 7-9%. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
