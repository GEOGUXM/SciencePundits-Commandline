This paper presents the development of a wind interior permanent-magnet synchronous generator (IPMSG)-based dc microgrid and its operation control. First, the derated characteristics of PMSG systems with various ac/dc converters and operation controls are comparatively analyzed. Then, the IPMSG followed by a three-phase Vienna switch-mode rectifier is developed to establish the common dc bus of dc microgrid. Good developed power and voltage regulation characteristics are achieved via the proposed commutation tuning, robust current, and voltage controls. Second, a single-phase three-wire inverter is constructed to serve as the test load. Good ac 220 V/110 V output voltage waveforms under unknown and nonlinear loads are preserved by the developed robust waveform tracking control scheme. Third, a battery energy storage system is established, and the fast energy storage support response is obtained via the proposed droop control approach with adaptive predictive current control method. In addition, a chopped dump load is equipped to enhance the energy balance control flexibility. Â© 1986-2012 IEEE.
