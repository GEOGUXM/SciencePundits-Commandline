This paper presents an independent operation of the rotor-side converter (RSC) and grid-side converter (GSC) for a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind energy conversion system under unbalanced grid voltage conditions. In this paper, the RSC is controlled to achieve four different control targets, including balanced stator current, sinusoidal rotor current, smooth stator active and reactive powers, and constant DFIG electromagnetic torque. The GSC is commanded to keep the dc voltage at a constant value. Additional feedback compensators using resonant regulators for the RSC are employed, and the decompositions of the positive and negative sequence components and calculations of the rotor negative current references can be avoided. Another similar compensator is used in the GSC to suppress the dc voltage fluctuates and remove the GSC reactive power oscillations without the stator or rotor power information. The proposed method can make the RSC and GSC available to an independent operation with a simple implementation for higher reliability. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for both the RSC and GSC under unbalanced grid voltage conditions. Â© 1986-2012 IEEE.
