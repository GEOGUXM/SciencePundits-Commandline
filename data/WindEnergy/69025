Wind energy is becoming a significant source of generation in many countries because of its zero fuel cost and no air pollution. Due to integration of large-scale wind power in conventional grids, synchronous generators are being economically replaced. Modern wind farms are based on power electronics interface; and unlike synchronous generators, they do not have inherent frequency support capability. So, in a combined synchronous and non-synchronous machine based power system, it has always been a concern for a network operator to maintain system frequency within acceptable limits following a major disturbance. From power system security point of view, wind penetration can be limited by frequency response criteria. Up to now, several methodologies have been proposed to estimate maximum threshold of wind integration. However, none of them recommends how a system operator could be immediately informed about a secured wind penetration limit, as soon as generation profile is known. This paper proposes a new estimation tool of maximum wind penetration level from the frequency response adequacy point of view. Available system information viz. inertia and headroom are used as input parameters in the developed tool. Output of this tool will provide the highest margin of wind power that can be integrated at a particular load condition without violating frequency response constraints. The proposed technique is applied and analysed for a 250 bus, 65 machine Australian electricity network. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
