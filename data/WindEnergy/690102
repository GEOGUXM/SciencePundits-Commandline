In this paper we present an experimental design of new solar based thermoelectric generator with wind chimney. Presented generator mainly consists of four parts: a heat pipe with solar collector tube for solar heating, a wind chimney for cooling, a thermoelectric (TE) module for electricity generation and measurement devices-sensors. Presented generator based on experimental design. Aim of this experimental design is to show an alternative way for cheap and efficiently renewable energy producing. The most important features of presented generator are uncomplicated structure, efficiently and cheapness. This experimental design can be improved and used for domestic and commercial application. For this reason, main parts of system can be enhanced and system can be improved. To evaluate of presented generator we collected some experimental data on designed system. Then maximum output power, electrical efficiency and Seebeck coefficient are calculated from obtained data. Results of the measurement are displayed in the form of graphs and tables. Our experiment was carried out on 16th and 21th August, in Samsun, on the north coast of Turkey with the exact location 41°14′N 36°26′E with sea level. Collection of the data was performed from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
