The rapid consumption of non-renewable resources has resulted in an ever-increasing problem of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions that has motivated people for investigating the harvesting of energy from renewable alternatives (e.g. solar and wind). Efficient electrochemical energy storage devices play a crucial role in storing harvested energies in our daily lives. For example, rechargeable batteries can store energy generated by solar cells during the daytime and release it during night-time. In particular, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have received considerable attention ever since their early commercialization in 1990s. However, with initiatives by several governments to build large-scale energy grids to store energy for cities, problems such as the high cost and limited availability of lithium starts to become major issues. Sodium, which also belongs to Group 1 of the periodic table, has comparable electrochemical properties to Lithium, and more importantly it is considerably more accessible than lithium. Nonetheless, research into sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) is currently still in its infancy compared to LIBs, although great leaps and bounds have been made recently in terms of research and development into this technology. Here in this review, we summarize the recent advancements made, also covering the prospective materials for both the battery cathode and anode. Additionally, opinions on possible solutions through correlating trends in recent papers will be suggested. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry.
