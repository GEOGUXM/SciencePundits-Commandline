This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation and a three dimensional numerical analysis of the transient aerodynamic phenomena occurring in the innovative modification of classic Savonius wind turbine. An attempt to explain the increased efficiency of the innovative design a comparison with the traditional solution is undertaken. A vorticity measure based on the integral of the velocity gradient tensor second invariant is proposed in order to evaluate and compare designs. The discussed criterion is related to the vortex structures and energy dissipation. These structures are generated by the rotor and may affect the efficiency. Â© 2015 The Author(s)
