Wind power is developing rapidly as a means of handling the world's energy shortage and associated environmental problems. The Gansu provincial wind energy resources have around 237-GW wind power potential in China. In this paper, a study on key technologies of Hexi 750-kV power transmission line protections has been carried out. The project includes some characteristics, such as large-scale wind power, long-distance EHV lines, and so on. We used 49.5-MW doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbines in this project and different situations when a fault occurs in the presence of DFIG are studied and investigated. By the aid of stator-flux-oriented vector strategy, the system is modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC software on the basis of the real information from the wind farm site. The fault analysis is studied while the fault location is changed and the crowbar protection is ON/OFF. The data and information have been obtained by field experience of the wind farm in Gansu province. Also, the matrix pencil algorithm has been applied as a novel method in this project. This analysis can ease the protection issues and push the schedule to the next steps. With these results, we are able to adapt our system with smart grids and provide some novel methods to stabilize and control the wind farm. Â© 2003-2010 IEEE.
