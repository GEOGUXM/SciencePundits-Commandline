The rapid increase of wind power penetration into power systems around the world has led transmission system operators to enforce stringent grid codes requiring novel functionalities from renewable energy-based power generation. For this reason, there exists a need to asses whether wind turbines (WTs) will comply with such functionalities to ensure power system stability. This paper demonstrates that Type-2 WTs may induce sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) events when connected to a series-compensated transmission line, and with proper control, they may also suppress such events. The paper presents a complete dynamic model tailored to study, via eigenanalysis, SSR events in the presence of Type-2 WTs, and a systematic procedure to design a power system stabilizer using only local and measurable signals. Results are validated through a case study based on the IEEE first benchmark model for SSR studies, as well as with transient computer simulations. Â© 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
