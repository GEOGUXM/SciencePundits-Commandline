In order to meet power needs, with concern for economics and environment, wind energy conversion is gradually gaining interest as a suitable source of renewable energy. To maximize the power extraction from the wind, optimization techniques are used at the various module of a wind farm starting from wind farm design for siting, sizing, optimal placement and sizing of distributed generation (DG) sources, generation scheduling, tuning of PID controller, control of wind energy conversion system (WECS) etc. This paper mainly focuses on the optimization algorithms (mostly the swarm based) in relation to integration of the wind farm with the grid. The paper here gives a precise idea about different optimization techniques, their advantage and disadvantage with respect to a wind farm. This review will enable the researchers to open the mind to explore possible applications in this field as well as beyond this area. Â©2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
