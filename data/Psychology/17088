The Affordable Care Act (ACA) represents a paradigm shift in the U.S. health care system, which has implications for psychology programs producing the next generation of trainees. In particular, the ACA has established the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), which has been tasked with developing national priorities and funding research aimed at improving health care quality by helping patients and providers make informed health care decisions. PCORI's national priorities span 5 broad domains: person-centered outcomes research, health disparities research, health care systems research, communication and dissemination research, and methodologic research. As these national priorities overlap with the knowledge and skills often emphasized in psychology training programs, initiatives by training programs to bolster strengths in these domains could place trainees at the forefront of this emerging research paradigm. As a part of a new master's program in behavioral health, our program developed a health psychology course modeled around PCORI's 5 national priorities; an initial evaluation in a small sample supported student learning in the 5 PCORI domains. The current report has implications for familiarizing readers with PCORI's national priorities for U.S. health care, stimulating debate surrounding psychology's response to the largest health care paradigm shift in recent U.S. history, and providing a working model for programs seeking to implement PCORI-related changes to their curricula.
