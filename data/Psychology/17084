The present study evaluated a new integrated treatment concept offering inpatient care, acute psychiatric day hospital and outpatient treatment by the same therapeutic team. 178 patients participated in this randomized controlled trial. Data on psychopathology, global and social functioning, patient satisfaction, continuity of care and administrative data was gathered on admission, throughout the course of treatment, upon discharge and at 1-year follow-up. In addition, the physicians in charge rated the therapeutic relationship. The data analysis consists of group-wise comparisons and regression analyses (cross-tabulations and χ2 test statistics for categorical data and Mann–Whitney U tests for continuous data). Differences between groups over time were analyzed with a series of generalized linear mixed model. The integrated care group showed a significant reduction in psychopathological impairment (20.7 %) and an improvement of psychosocial functioning (36.8 %). The mean number of days before re-admission was higher in the control group when compared to the integrated care group (156.8 vs. 91.5). There was no difference in the number of re-admissions and days spent in psychiatric institutions. This new approach offers a treatment model, which facilitates continuity of care. Beside it improves psychopathological outcome measures and psychosocial functioning in patients with mental illness. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.
