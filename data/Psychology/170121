Reports an error in "Neurosciences, empathy, and healthy interpersonal relationships: Recent findings and implications for counseling psychology" by Joana Fernandes Coutinho, Patrícia Oliveira Silva and Jean Decety (Journal of Counseling Psychology, 2014[Oct], Vol 61[4], 541-548). The author note should have included funding information for Joana Fernandes Coutinho and Patrícia Oliveira Silva. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-41344-008.) In this article, we define the construct of empathy and its relevance for counseling psychology. The importance of deficits in empathic processes for most of the psychological disorders is presented within the context of the social brain hypothesis (Frith, 2007). We provide a review of empirical research about the neural correlates of empathy in terms of both the central and peripheral nervous system. We present recent evidence on the cortical and subcortical regions involved in different dimensions of empathy-emotional contagion, cognitive and emotional empathy, and self-regulation. Regarding the autonomic correlates of empathy, we present evidence about the correlates of sympathetic arousal associated with empathic processes and review data supporting the idea of the physiological linkage or synchrony as indicator of empathy in interpersonal relationships. The implications of these findings for counseling psychology, particularly for the psychotherapist-client relationship and for context of intimate relationships or couples therapy, are discussed.
