Rural survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence experience considerable difficulties accessing mental health services. Similarly, graduate psychology training programs located in rural locations have historically been limited in their ability to provide trainees with extensive exposure to specific client populations. With the advent of distal technologies-especially secure, encrypted videoconferencing capabilities-it is now possible to connect rural clients with specialized, mental health services provided by university-based training clinics. This article reviews mental health care needs and treatment barriers experienced by rural populations, and describes an innovative solution to begin to address these problems. Specifically, a partnership between a university-based mental health care clinic and 3 rural domestic violence/rape crisis centers is described, and preliminary treatment outcome data are presented. Training benefits reported by graduate student therapists and satisfaction ratings provided by crisis center staff and advocates are also presented and discussed.
