The purpose of the present study was to quantitatively and qualitatively examine whether claimed self-handicapping is increased in a performance motivational climate (PMC) compared with a mastery motivational climate (MMC) within a strictly controlled tropical environment. Participants completed measures of self-handicapping using open-ended questions before a physical test. The analyses revealed that (a) participants who engage in self-handicapping strategy were more numerous, (b) the number of self-handicap reported self-handicap score were greater, and (c) participants who engage in self-handicapping strategy reported more impediments in the PMC as compared with MMC. Information about the nature of self-handicapping claims is also provided. 2015 Copyright Â© Association for Applied Sport Psychology
