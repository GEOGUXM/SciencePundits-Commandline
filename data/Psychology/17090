Efforts in describing the competencies required for entry into the profession of health service psychology have outpaced efforts describing how they should be assessed. To promote more empirical work in the area of competency assessment, we describe a model for developing and using a competency assessment checklist to assess the process of competency acquisition during training as well as program outcomes. Using data from 8 cohorts of students in an accredited program in clinical psychology, the process of competency acquisition is examined during doctoral training. Such an assessment method serves as a useful tool for students enrolled in training as they monitor their individual competency acquisition, for faculty who evaluate student readiness to progress to more advanced phases of training, and for program evaluation by accrediting and other regulatory bodies.
