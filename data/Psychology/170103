Every day, we need to apply different action control strategies to successfully interact with ever-changing environments. In situations requiring several responses, we often have to cascade different actions. The strategies used to accomplish this have been subject to extensive research in cognitive psychology and neuroscience but it has remained rather unclear if and to what degree such strategies are adapted while performing a task. Furthermore, we do not know if such adaptations are subject to differential effects depending on an individual's preferred initial strategy to cope with multiple-demand situations. Using Bayesian analyses, we were able to show that even though the applied strategy is subject to slight modulations over the course of an action cascading task, this shift is equally strong for subjects who differ their general action cascading strategy. The action cascading strategy subjects apply to cope with multiple-demand situations is adapted independent of the preferred, inter-individually varying strategy that is initially used. Future research needs to test if the task goal activation strategy applied during action cascading reflects a 'cognitive trait' and is stable across different situations.
