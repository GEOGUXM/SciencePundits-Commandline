Studies of social tourism have concentrated on the benefits for young families and people with disabilities, yet few analyses have investigated its wellbeing value for economically disadvantaged older people. Based on participant-driven interviews during a UK social tourism trip, this paper informs understandings of social tourism experiences and explores the links between wellbeing and social tourism opportunities for older people. It reveals that social tourism presents older individuals with occasions for escape, respite, companionship, and reminiscence and for renegotiation of self-identity following spousal bereavement, but that these trips can be anxiously anticipated. The study proposes a research agenda, which explores the physiological, psychological, social and spiritual impacts of social tourism on older people's wellbeing. Â© 2015.
