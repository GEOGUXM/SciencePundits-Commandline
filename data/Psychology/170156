Using self-determination theory as the theoretical framework, the purpose of the current study was to examine the effect of (a) a guided imagery intervention on children's active play, and (b) intrinsic motivation as a mediating variable between the intervention and active play. Fifty-nine students were randomized into an imagery group (“tigers”) or a control group (“lions”). The imagery group reported higher levels of active play at the end of the intervention compared to the control group. Results supported the mediating role of intrinsic motivation on active play. Findings highlight imagery use as a method to positively influence children's activity levels. 2015 Copyright © Association for Applied Sport Psychology
