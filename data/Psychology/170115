This study examined the benefits of the Diversity Mentorship Scholarship Program (DMSP). The DMSP is sponsored by the Association of Counseling Center Training Agencies, the professional organization for psychology internships in college and university counseling center settings. The Association of Counseling Center Training Agencies developed the DSMP to further its social justice mission. This program aims to increase the diversity in leadership in psychology training, providing mentors and leaders for students and early career psychologists. Diverse representation in positions of leadership is thought to positively contribute to increasing diversity in the student population, thus, this program also aims to increase diversity within the field as a whole. Prior scholarship recipients from 19 years of the program were surveyed to identify perceived benefits of the program and associated outcomes. Participants reported benefits to their professional identities and sense of competency as training psychologists focused on diversity issues. Participants especially perceived an increase in their professional networks in the training community, and this was particularly strong among psychologists of color. Participants were overwhelmingly involved with training in their careers following the DMSP, with many involved in leadership positions. Results are discussed with a focus on the potential implications of diversifying training directors and leadership in professional psychology and how that can positively contribute to increased diversity within the psychological community.
