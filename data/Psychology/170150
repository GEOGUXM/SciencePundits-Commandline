Introduction: Group therapy can be highly influential in helping addicts (individuals presenting with problematic addictive behaviors) achieve and maintain cessation. The efficacy of such groups can be understood by the effects they have on members' social identity and also through associated group processes. The current paper introduces the Social Identity Model of Cessation Maintenance (SIMCM). Methods: The SIMCM outlines how a number of processes (including self/collective efficacy and esteem, normative structure and social support and control) may affect cessation maintenance. It also provides a framework to make predictions about how automatic and/or implicit processes influence the activation of addiction relevant identities through cognitive accessibility and complexity in particular. Results: A review of initial empirical evidence supporting some of the key specified relationships is provided, along with potential applications in therapy settings. Conclusions: Insights into how SIMCM could be generalized beyond treatment contexts and avenues for future research are outlined. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
