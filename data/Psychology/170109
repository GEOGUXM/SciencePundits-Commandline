The Psychological Society of Ireland was established in 1970 to promote psychology as a pure and applied science, to support the development of a then fledgling profession, and to ensure that Irish psychologists were represented locally, nationally and internationally. Over the past 40 years, the Society has evolved from a small but dynamic group of committed members to the modern professional body that exists today. This article presents a reflection that aims to capture the story of the internal evolution of the Society. It outlines the development of the Society's Council, boards and committees, the role and responsibilities of officers, the establishment of, at first, regional groups, followed by special interest groups and in later years by the emergence of divisions. It concludes with some reflections on the challenges ahead and the need for the professional body to adapt and evolve further to meet the needs of its members in a changing context.
