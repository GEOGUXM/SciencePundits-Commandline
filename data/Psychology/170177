The aim of this study was to investigate epistemological beliefs and programme coherence in nursing, social work and general teacher-training programmes. An abstract theoretical knowledge base is a key characteristic of professions. However, reports have shown a gap between professional education and professional practice. Data used in this study are taken from surveys among students, college teachers and placement supervisors. The results of this study do not corroborate with the notion of clashing epistemological beliefs between the educational field and the field of practice. However, the results do indicate that the way theories are taught and how students study may influence student views of the importance of theoretical knowledge for professional practice. The general teacher-training programme, more than the other programmes, faces challenges in linking theory to practice. The nursing programme also encounters difficulties in college teachers being able to relate some of the nursing-specific theories to practice in the classroom setting. Moreover, the findings imply that not only programme coherence, but also students' study efforts might be essential aspects in explaining why some students do not perceive theoretical knowledge as important for professional practice.
