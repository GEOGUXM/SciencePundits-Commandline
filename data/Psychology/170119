The internship serves as the capstone training experience for the doctoral psychologist. Increasingly, the task of determining whether or not interns are prepared to meet licensing and practice expectations of competency has fallen more heavily on the internship programs themselves. Our previous research concluded that the California School of Professional Psychology examination model for determining competency was superior in variance of scores among interns who successfully completed the internship. The current study related California School of Professional Psychology oral examination performance in six domains to end-of-rotation supervisor ratings of five competency areas and intern case presentation evaluations over 4 training years. We found little to no relation between end-of-internship competency exam performance and supervisor ratings of competence. We note that, due to the pass/fail exam paradigm, interns may have intentionally limited the complexity of their performance, opting to safely pass rather than perform exceptionally but risk failure. Implications for competency evaluation are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record Â© 2015 APA, all rights reserved).
