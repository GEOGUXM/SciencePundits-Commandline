We present a neural network model of the storage of episode representations in working memory (WM). Our key idea is that episodes are encoded in WM as prepared sensorimotor routines, i.e. as prepared sequences of attentional and motor operations. Our network reproduces several experimental findings about the representation of prepared sequences in prefrontal cortex. Interpreted as a model of WM episode representations, it has useful applications in an account of long-term memory for episodes and in accounts of sentence processing.
