According to recent studies, the manufacturing and construction of the structural elements of buildings (for example, columns, beams and load-bearing walls) represent the largest proportion of embodied impacts. Some of these reports highlight the need to analyse the materials and techniques used today in order to make the building sector more sustainable. This paper presents the results of embodied energy and global warming potential, using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, for load-bearing walls, being these one of the most common types of structures for buildings. This study analyses through an eco-design tool new options for materials used in the construction of structural load-bearing walls. The research aims to examine the environmental performance of each material alternative assessed: fired clay brick masonry (FC), concrete block masonry (CB), reinforced concrete-based wall (RC), and stabilized soil block masonry (SS); stabilized with natural fibers and alginates. These conventional and new materials - especially those with a low level of embodied energy, such as earth blocks - are evaluated from the point of view of their environmental consequences.
