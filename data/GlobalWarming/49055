Abstract A hybrid molten carbonate fuel cell power plant and carbon dioxide capturing process is investigated through the exergy and advanced exergy analysis. The results show that the greatest exergy destruction (181 MW) occurs in the combustion chamber. It is because of irreversibility of the chemical reactions in the combustion process. Also the lowest exergy efficiency is related to the fuel cell. Advanced exergy analysis shows that the most portion of the exergy destruction is avoidable (more than 65%). Optimal design of the process is done by adjusting the effective operating conditions for reducing the power consumption and carbon dioxide emission of the process. Results of the optimization shows that the power consumption in the compressors can be reduced up to 33%. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
