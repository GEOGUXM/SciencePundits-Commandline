Electricity generation using renewable energy generation technologies is one of the most practical alternatives for network planners in order to achieve national and international Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reduction targets. Renewable Distributed Generation (DG) based Hybrid Energy System (HES) is a sustainable solution for serving electricity demand with reduced GHG emissions. A multi-objective optimisation technique for minimising cost, GHG emissions and generation uncertainty has been proposed in this paper to design HES for sustainable power generation and distribution system planning while considering economic and environmental issues and uncertainty in power availability of renewable resources. Life cycle assessment has been carried out to estimate the global warming potential of the embodied GHG emissions from the electricity generation technologies. The uncertainty in the availability of renewable resources is modelled using the method of moments. A design procedure for building sustainable HES has been presented and the sensitivity analysis is conducted for determining the optimal solution set. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
