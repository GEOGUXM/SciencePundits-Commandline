This study analyses the circumstances of environmental advantage by benchmarking a novel Kraft pulp fibre reinforced polypropylene against its matrix material and two other composites with talcum and glass fibres. With one exception, all composites use less non-renewable energy (-1% to -29%), but only the Kraft pulp fibre reinforced polypropylene achieves a reduction in global warming potential (14% to 35%) considering different functional units compared to polypropylene. The comparisons on basis of function-strength and stiffness in this case study-show that the adequate application of specific material properties, are key to achieve environmental advantages.
