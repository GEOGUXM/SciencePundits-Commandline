Notothenioidei, the taxonomic group of teleosts that dominates the Southern Ocean and dwell in the Ross Sea at large, provide an example of marine species that underwent unique adaptations to life at low temperatures and high oxygen concentrations, resulting in morphological, physiological, genomic, and biochemical peculiarities in comparison with warm-water fish. Global Warming raises concerns over the fate of these stenothermal fish, as their adaptation has been accompanied by irreversible genomic losses, which suggest a poor genetic potential to adapt to warmer climates. Specifically, this review focuses on adaptation of proteins belonging to the globin superfamily, which include the respiratory proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin and the non-respiratory proteins neuroglobin and cytoglobin. Here, we describe their molecular adaptations to cold temperatures in the framework of the physiology of oxygen transport and management of oxidative stress in fish species largely populating the Ross Sea.
