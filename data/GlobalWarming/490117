Key message: This study is an important contribution to understanding of the dormancy dynamics of apple buds grown in contrasting climates, highlighting the main factors possibly involved in their control and the key role of rehydration.Abstract: The aim of this study was to compare the dormancy dynamics and the physiological status of vegetative and floral buds of apple cultivars grown during cold and mild winters. Long shoots bearing vegetative buds and short shoots bearing floral buds were regularly collected during two successive cycles at Marsillargues, France (2011/12, 2012/13) and Palmas, Paraná, Brazil (2012, 2013). The dormant state in vegetative buds was evaluated by the single-node cutting test and in floral buds by the Tabuenca’s test. The first approach highlighted important differences in the dormancy dynamics in both sites, clearly showing that: (1) the entry and the maximum level of dormancy are strongly correlated with cold winter temperatures; (2) the three classical phases of dormancy dynamics are difficult to differentiate under a mild winter climate; and (3) endodormancy, if it actually exists, is very weak and lasts only for a short time. Distinct temporal changes between both sites were found for flower primordia fresh and dry weight. The ecodormant state was linked to significant changes in dry weight and the capacity to quickly reach a water content of around 77 % according to the Tabuenca’s test. High temperatures in Brazil allowed a quick transition between endodormancy and ecodormancy compared to France where the rehydration period was long. The weak endodormancy associated with a quasi-absence of ecodormancy could explain the strong spatio-temporal heterogeneity of budburst and flowering under a mild winter climate. This may be useful for understanding the future phenology of trees under global warming conditions and for the selection of adapted cultivars. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg
