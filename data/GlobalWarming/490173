Changes in the carbon (C) balance of boreal forest ecosystems may impact the global C cycle and climate. The degree to which antecedent temperature regime and mineral protection of soil organic matter (OM) influence the temperature response of boreal soil C pools remains unknown, however. To investigate these phenomena on time scales relevant to anthropogenic climate change, we quantified the temperature response of four soil C pools (L, F and H organic horizons and B mineral horizon) within soil profiles collected from replicated sites representing two regions along a climate transect ("regional warming") during a 480-day incubation at 5 and 15°C ("experimental warming"). We hypothesized that 1) warmer region soils would exhibit reduced bioreactivity, a measure of C lability assessed via cumulative soil C mineralization, relative to colder region soils, paralleling a decrease in bioreactivity with depth in both regions, and 2) temperature sensitivity of C mineralization (denoted as Q<inf>10</inf>) would increase with decreasing bioreactivity congruent with the "C quality-temperature" (CQT) hypothesis, with a smaller effect in mineral soil where physico-chemical protection likely occurs. Cumulative C mineralization decreased from surface L to deeper horizons and from the cold to warm region for organic F and H horizons only. This decrease in soil bioreactivity with depth was paralleled by an increase in Q<inf>10</inf> with depth as expected, except in mineral soil where Q<inf>10</inf> was similar to or lower relative to the overlying organic layer. The lower bioreactivity in F and H horizons of the warm relative to the cold region was not, however, associated with a greater Q<inf>10.</inf> A warmer regional climate in these otherwise similar forests thus resulted in reduced bioreactivity of isolated soil C pools without increasing the temperature sensitivity of soil C mineralization. This suggests that assumptions about temperature sensitivity of C mineralization based on the propensity for isolated organic C pools to undergo mineralization may not be valid in some organic-rich, boreal forest soils. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
