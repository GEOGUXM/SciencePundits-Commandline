Based on daily precipitation data from 24 stations over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, the long-term trends of daily precipitation are analyzed during the period 1960–2012 using 12 precipitation indices. The results indicate that the following. (1) For the regional average trends of precipitation, nine indices [i.e., RR, SDII, PCI(day), R25mm, R50mm, R25mmT, R50mmT, R25mmTOT, and R50mmTOT] show the increasing trends, while three indices [i.e., RX1day, RR1 and PCI(month)] display the decreasing trends. Furthermore, the annual total precipitation (RR) is correlated strongly with most of the other precipitation indices, especially indices represent the heavy precipitation which is responsible for more than 90 % of the total increase of precipitation. (2) The central and southern parts of the study area become more humid than the northern parts, although the daily precipitation undergo a consistent concentrated trend over almost all of the study area. Moreover, the frequency and contribution of the heavy precipitation also arise dramatically in almost the entire study area, and the precipitation events show the significant trend of extremeness. (3) The abrupt changes for RR, RX1day, SDII, R50mm, R50mmT, and R50mmTOT are detected in 1984, 1988, 1987, 1984, 1988, and 1988, respectively, which indicate the abrupt change of precipitation occurred consistently in the mid-1980s. Three major cycles of precipitation detected are 5–6-year cycle, 13-year cycle, and 20-year cycle, with a nonsignificant 2-year cycle coexisted. In addition, a significant change of cycles occurred in the 1980s, when the short cycle was set to overtake the long cycle, resulting in high-frequency and instability of precipitation changes over the YRD region in recent decades. (4) There are three factors (the global warming, the East Asian summer monsoon change, and the urbanization development) might potentially impact on the frequency and volume of precipitation. The variation of East Asian summer monsoon is the key factor that influences the increase of precipitation, while the global warming and the urbanization development perform the background factor and the local factor, respectively. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Wien
