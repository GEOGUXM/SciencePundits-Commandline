Aims: The objective of this study was to elucidate the composition of bacterial communities from the soil, and endosphere and phyllosphere of upper and lower leaves and clarify the responses to elevated CO<inf>2</inf> and/or soil temperature. Methods: Using 454 pyrosequencing, the 16S rRNA gene was analyzed from various bacterial communities in a rice paddy that was exposed to different atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> concentrations (ambient, +200 μmol.mol−1) and soil temperatures (ambient, +2 °C). Results: The treatments of elevated temperature and elevated CO<inf>2</inf> plus temperature exerted significant influence on the structure of bacterial communities from the lower leaf endosphere. A significant influence of elevated CO<inf>2</inf> plus temperature on the community structure was also observed in the upper leaf phyllosphere. The richness and diversity of bacterial communities from the lower leaf phyllosphere, upper leaf endosphere, and upper leaf phyllosphere were significantly affected by elevated CO<inf>2</inf> plus temperature. However, we did not observe any significant influence of all climate change treatments (elevated CO<inf>2</inf>, elevated temperature, and their combination) on the richness, diversity, and structure of soil bacterial communities. We also did not observe any significant effect of the single factor, elevated CO<inf>2</inf>, on the structure of the leaf endosphere and phyllosphere bacterial communities. Enterobacteriaceae and Xanthomonadaceae were the most shifted phylotypes in response to elevated temperature and elevated CO<inf>2</inf> plus temperature. Conclusions: Soil bacterial communities were more resistant to the tested climate change factors compare with foliar bacterial communities. Temperature was a more important factor in shaping the structure of foliar bacterial communities compared with CO<inf>2</inf>. The response of leaf-associated bacterial communities could be influenced by the leaf location (upper leaf or lower leaf) within the rice plants and by the habitats (leaf endosphere or phyllosphere). © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland
