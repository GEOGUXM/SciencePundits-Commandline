Growth of secondary forest (capoeira) is an important factor in absorption of carbon from the atmosphere. Estimates of this absorption vary greatly, in large part due to the effect of different land-use histories on the estimates available in the literature. We relate land-use history to aboveground biomass accumulation of secondary vegetation in plots on land that had been used for agriculture (unmechanized manioc and maize) and for pasture in small rural properties in the Tarumã-Mirim settlement near Manaus in central Amazonia, Brazil. We evaluated influence of (a) age of the second growth vegetation, (b) time of use as agriculture or pasture and (c) number of times the area was burned. Biomass data were obtained by destructive sampling of all plants with diameter at breast height >1. cm in 24 parcels of secondary vegetation ranging from 1 to 15. years of age in abandoned pasture (n= 9) and agriculture (n= 15). As compared to secondary vegetation in abandoned agricultural fields, vegetation in abandoned cattle pasture (the predominant use history for Amazonian secondary vegetation) grows 38% more slowly to age 6. years. Number of burns also negatively affects biomass recovery. Applying the growth rates we measured to the secondary forests reported in Brazil's Second National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change suggests that carbon uptake by this vegetation is overestimated by a factor of four in the report. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
