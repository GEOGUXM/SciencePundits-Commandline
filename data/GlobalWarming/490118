Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has attracted worldwide attention as a near-term technology to decelerate global warming. Postcombustion CO<inf>2</inf> capture utilizes existing coal-fired power plants, and aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) scrubbing is the most common capture technology. However, the heat and energy requirements of solvent regeneration and CO<inf>2</inf> liquefaction cause a 30% decrease in net power output. This power de-rate is a major obstacle to implementing CCS. In this study, simulation-based parametric optimization was performed to minimize the power de-rate. Postcombustion CO<inf>2</inf> capture with aqueous MEA scrubbing (85%, 90%, and 95% removals) and CO<inf>2</inf> liquefaction integrated with a 550 MWe supercritical coal-fired power plant was simulated. The liquid to gas ratio and stripper operating pressure of the CO<inf>2</inf> capture process were the manipulated variables with steam extracted from the intermediate pressure-low pressure crossover pipe and the first low pressure turbine as possible heat sources. The power de-rate was reduced to 17.7% when operating at optimum conditions. Â© 2015 American Chemical Society.
