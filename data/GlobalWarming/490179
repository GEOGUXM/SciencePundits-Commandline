Soil respiration (SR) and microbial respiration (MR), which were primarily regulated by soil temperature, can act as a feedback to climate change. Although many studies suggest that global warming will accelerate carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) emissions from soil, the magnitude of this feedback is unknown, mostly due to uncertainty in the temperature sensitivity (Q<inf>10</inf>, increaing ratio of SR and MR after a 10°C increase of temperature) of SR and MR. To investigate the seasonal variation of short-term Q<inf>10</inf> and estimate how grazing impacts temperature sensitivity of SR and MR, we measured SR and MR in a fenced and a grazed grassland on the loess plateau, northwestern China, during 2008–2010. In this semiarid grassland ecosystem, soil temperature was the dominant factor controlling SR and MR during the experimental period. Short-term apparent Q<inf>10</inf> of SR and MR had a clearly seasonal variation, and was significantly and negatively related to soil temperature at 2-cm depth. However, no relationship was found between soil moisture (0–10 cm soil layer) and apparent Q<inf>10</inf>. By decreasing soil organic carbon and root biomass, grazing reduced the long-term Q<inf>10</inf> of SR and MR. In both the short term and the long term, Q<inf>10</inf> of MR was lower than that of SR, suggesting that autotrophic respiration is more sensitive than heterotrophic respiration to temperature. We emphasize the importance of using Q<inf>10</inf> when modeling trajectories of soil carbon stocks under climate change scenarios, and the seasonal variation of Q<inf>10</inf> should also be regarded as a parameter in the global carbon models. © 2015 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition
