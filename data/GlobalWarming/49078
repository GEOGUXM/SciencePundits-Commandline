Effects of global warming on ecosystem have attracted lots of attention; however, ecological response to climate change has been hardly documented in alpine regions. Here we investigated climate warming induced ecological changes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) over the past 50years on the basis of a large amount of in situ field observation and remote sensing data. We found that climate warming up to 0.41°C/10a has greatly improved the heat conditions on the TP, thus exhibits a growth of 46,000ha farmland during the past 30years, with the largest growth rate by 19% which occurred above 4000m. Terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) has increased by 0.002PgCa-1. Broad-leaved forest had the highest average NPP. Cultivated vegetation contributes most for causing NPP growth in the recent 30years. We also found that seasonal frozen soil depth decreased as the consequence of climate warming. Increased snow-melting inflated lake and river areas, whereas swamp area decreased owing to reduced moisture in the root zone. Freeze-thawing erosion decreased because of the reduced annual range of temperature. Understanding the ecological effects of climate change on the TP is of great significance to improve environmental management and promote sustainable development. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
