Gold kiwifruit pomace extracted using citric acid, water and enzyme (Celluclast 1.5L) were studied in terms of pectin yield, protein, ash, non-starch polysaccharide, galacturonic acid (GalA), neutral sugar composition, molar mass (M<inf>w</inf>), viscosity and degree of branching. Water-extracted pectin was considered closest to its native form. Enzyme extracted pectin showed the highest yield (∼4.5% w/w) as compared with the acid and water extraction methods (∼3.6-3.8% w/w). Pectin obtained from different extraction methods showed different degree of branching. The M<inf>w</inf> and root mean square (RMS) radius varied with the extraction methods with values of 8.4 × 105 g/mol and 92 nm, 8.5 × 105 g/mol and 102 nm, 6.7 × 105 g/mol and 52 nm for acid, water and enzymatic extraction methods, respectively. Similar trend was observed for pectin viscosity, with water-extracted pectin giving a slightly higher viscosity followed by acid and enzyme-extracted pectin. This study showed that gold kiwifruit pomace pectin has potential application in food products. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
