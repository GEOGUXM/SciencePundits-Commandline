The mineral brianyoungite, a carbonate-sulphate of zinc, has been studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with chemical analysis using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) and Raman and infrared spectroscopy. Multiple carbonate stretching modes are observed and support the concept of non-equivalent carbonate units in the brianyoungite structure. Intense Raman band at 1056 cm-1 with shoulder band at 1038 cm-1 is assigned to the CO<inf>3</inf>2- ν<inf>1</inf> symmetric stretching mode. Two intense Raman bands at 973 and 984 cm-1 are assigned to the symmetric stretching modes of the SO<inf>4</inf>2- anion. The observation of two bands supports the concept of the non-equivalence of sulphate units in the brianyoungite structure. Raman bands at 704 and 736 cm-1 are assigned to the CO<inf>3</inf>2- ν<inf>4</inf> bending modes and Raman bands at 507, 528, 609 and 638 cm-1 are assigned to the CO<inf>3</inf>2- ν<inf>2</inf> bending modes. Multiple Raman and infrared bands in the OH stretching region are observed, proving the existence of water and hydroxyl units in different molecular environments in the structure of brianyoungite. Vibrational spectroscopy enhances our knowledge of the molecular structure of brianyoungite. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
