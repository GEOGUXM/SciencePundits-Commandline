Abstract Experiments were conducted in open-top chambers to assess the effect of atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> enrichment (E-CO<inf>2</inf>) on the quality of grains in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) crop. Physical attributes of the grains was not affected, but the hydration and swelling capacities of the flour increased. Increase in carbohydrates and reduction in protein made the grains more carbonaceous (higher C:N) under E-CO<inf>2</inf>. Among other mineral nutrients, K, Ca and Zn concentrations decreased, while P, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn and B concentrations did not change. The pH, bulk density and cooking time of chickpea flour remained unaffected, although the water absorption capacity of flour increased and oil absorption reduced. Results suggest that E-CO<inf>2</inf> could affect the grain quality adversely and nutritional imbalance in grains of chickpea might occur. Â© 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
