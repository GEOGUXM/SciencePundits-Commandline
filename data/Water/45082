The unique primary and secondary coordination environments surrounding the active site of hydrogenase enzymes play a crucial role in H2 activation and transfer reactions. [Fe]-hydrogenase contains a 2-hydroxypyridine ligand motif, and many researchers have incorporated this design element into synthetic catalysts. Transition metal complexes supported by 2-hydroxypyridine scaffolds are catalysts for chemical conversion schemes relevant to alternative energy applications and, in addition to hydrogenase-type reactivity, find new uses in other chemical domains. In this review, the current status of 2-hydroxypyridine-derived catalysts is described with an emphasis on design features that lead to lower energy catalytic pathways. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
