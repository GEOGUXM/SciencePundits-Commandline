Raman and infrared spectra of three well-defined turquoise samples, CuAl<inf>6</inf>(PO<inf>4</inf>)<inf>4</inf>(OH)<inf>8</inf>·4H<inf>2</inf>O, from Lavender Pit, Bisbee, Cochise county, Arizona; Kouroudaiko mine, Faleme river, Senegal and Lynch Station, Virginia were studied, interpreted and compared. Observed Raman and infrared bands were assigned to the stretching and bending vibrations of phosphate tetrahedra, water molecules and hydroxyl ions. Approximate O-H⋯O hydrogen bond lengths were inferred from the Raman and infrared spectra. No Raman and infrared bands attributable to the stretching and bending vibrations of (PO<inf>3</inf>OH)2- units were observed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
