The isothermal excess molar enthalpies for binary mixtures of different amines with water were measured with a C-80 Setaram calorimeter. The experimental results indicate that the excess molar enthalpy is related to the molecular structure. The experimental excess molar enthalpies were satisfactorily fitted with the Redlich-Kister equation. They were also used to test the suitability of the NRTL model, and the deviations are a little larger than the R-K equation. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
