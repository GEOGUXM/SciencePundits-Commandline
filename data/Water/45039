Background: Urinary density (UD) has been routinely used for decades as a surrogate marker for urine osmolality (U<inf>osm</inf>). We asked if UD can accurately estimate U<inf>osm</inf> both in healthy subjects and in different clinical scenarios of kidney disease. Methods: UD was assessed by refractometry. U<inf>osm</inf> was measured by freezing point depression in spot urines obtained from healthy volunteers (N = 97) and in 319 inpatients with acute kidney injury (N = 95), primary glomerulophaties (N = 118) or chronic kidney disease (N = 106). Results: UD and U<inf>osm</inf> correlated in all groups (p < 0.05). However, a wide range of U<inf>osm</inf> values was associated with each UD value. When UD was ≤ 1.010, 28.4% of samples had U<inf>osm</inf> above 350 mOsm/kg. Conversely, in 61.6% of samples with UD above 1.020, U<inf>osm</inf> was below 600 mOsm/kg. As expected, U<inf>osm</inf> exhibited a strong relationship with serum creatinine (S<inf>creat</inf> ), whereas a much weaker correlation was found between UD and S<inf>creat</inf>. Conclusion: We found that UD is not a substitute for U<inf>osm</inf>. Although UD was significantly correlated with U<inf>osm</inf>, the wide dispersion makes it impossible to use UD as a dependable clinical estimate of U<inf>osm</inf>. Evaluation of the renal concentrating ability should be based on direct determination of U<inf>osm</inf>. © 2015 Souza et al.; licensee BioMed Central.
