Abstract A simple and straightforward solution growth routine is developed to prepare microporous 3D nano/micro ZnO microsphere with a large BET surface area of 288 m2 g-1 at room temperature. The formation mechanism of the hierarchical 3D nano/micro ZnO microsphere and its corresponding hydrogen evolution performance has been deeply discussed. In particular, this novel hierarchical 3D ZnO microspheres performs undiminished hydrogen evolution for at least 24 h under simulated solar light illumination, even under the condition of no precious metal as cocatalyst. Since the complex production process of photocatalysts and high cost of precious metal cocatalyst remains a major constraint that hinders the application of solar water splitting, this 3D nano/micro ZnO microspheres could be expected to be applicable in the precious-metal-free solar water splitting system due to its merits of low cost, simple procedure and high catalytic activity.
