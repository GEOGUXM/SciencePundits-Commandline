MWCNTs (Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes) modified α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> (hematite) photoelectrodes have been investigated for their possible application in hydrogen generation via photoelectrochemical (PEC) splitting of water. Enhanced photoresponse seen in comparison to the pristine α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> films is credited to the effective charge facilitation and charge separation provided by MWCNT conducting support. 0.2wt% MWCNTs modified α-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> thin film exhibited the maximum photocurrent density of 2.8mA/cm2 at 0.75V/SCE. Measured values of flat band potential, donor density, resistance, Applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) and Incident-photon-to current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) support the observed enhancement in photocurrent. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
