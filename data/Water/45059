The aim of this study was to determine the aquifer parameters in Erho, Nigeria. This was carried out by drilling three test wells and three observation wells in the study location. Water was pumped from the test wells at a constant rate while the drawdown in the observation wells was determined as a function of time. The data obtained were subjected to graphical and analytical evaluation using the Cooper-Jacob method. The result revealed that the mean values of the transmissivity, storage coefficient and specific capacity of the aquifer layer are 6.15·10-2 m2/min, 9.3·10-4 and 0.33 m2/min respectively. Analysis of the results indicated that the aquifer will be very productive and able to supply sufficient quantity of water for the people. The result also revealed that the aquifer is confined and therefore dependable to provide good quality water for the people living in the area. © 2014 Anomohanran and Iserhien-Emekeme.
