Sage is a popular medicinal plant which is widely used in cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. A two years study was conducted to study the effects of different fertility systems on growth and essential oil production of sage under water deficiency. For this purpose, we used a randomized complete block design arranged in split plots with three replications. The maximum of dry matter (2.702±0.15tha-1), essential oil content (1.86±0.10%) and essential oil yield (37.30±3.83lha-1) were obtained in I<inf>1</inf> (no stress), I<inf>2</inf> (moderate water deficit), and I<inf>2</inf> (moderate water deficit), respectively. The highest of dry matter, essential oil content and essential oil yield were obtained in F<inf>5</inf> (Vermicompost+N fixing bacteria). Totally, 48 compounds were identified in essential oils of sage by means of GC-MS. 1,8-cineol, α-thujone and camphor were the dominant essential oil compounds which indicated an increasing under I<inf>2</inf>, F<inf>5</inf> and I<inf>2</inf>×F<inf>5</inf> treatments among the three times harvest. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
