The vibrational properties of glutathione have been investigated by infrared absorption and Raman spectroscopic techniques, and density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level. Assignments of all the experimentally observed vibrational bands have been done with the help of simulated vibrational spectra and potential energy distribution calculations of glutathione water cluster, which includes the effect of hydrogen bonding. Optimized molecular parameters of energy minimized structure have been compared with the available experimental values. Calculated molecular parameters of glutathione-water cluster match well with the experimental values. Some of the calculated molecular parameters and vibrational frequencies of vapor phase glutathione-water cluster suggest participation of some atoms of glutathione in hydrogen bonding. Experimentally observed UV-Visible absorption spectrum of glutathione has also been reported. Observed band at 203 nm has been assigned to electronic transitions calculated with time dependent density functional theory. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
