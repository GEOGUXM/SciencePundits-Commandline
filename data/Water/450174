Abstract Fe-N-S-tri-doped TiO<inf>2</inf> (FeNS-TiO<inf>2</inf>) was synthesized by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The as-synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The photocatalytic activities of as-synthesized samples were tested by the oxidation of methyl orange (MO), rhodamine B (RhB), methylene blue (MB) and the reduction of aqueous Cr(VI) under visible-light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation, and compared with N-dope P25 (N-P25) and the undoped TiO<inf>2</inf>. Besides, the effects of the coexistence of MO, RhB, and MB on FeNS-TiO<inf>2</inf>-mediated photocatalytic reduction of aqueous Cr(VI) were also studied. The results indicated FeNS-TiO<inf>2</inf> displayed higher visible-light-activated photocatalytic activity than N-P25 and the undoped TiO<inf>2</inf>. Otherwise, FeNS-TiO<inf>2</inf> showed the coexistence of MB enhanced the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI), whereas the coexistence of MO and RhB retarded the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) over FeNS-TiO<inf>2</inf>. Moreover, a possible photocatalytic mechanism is discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
