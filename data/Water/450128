A Schiff base-type fluorescence probe was prepared for the detection of copper (II) in foodstuffs. The probe is N,N′-bis(pyridoxal phosphate)-o-phenylenediamine (BPPP). It was synthesized by utilizing the Schiff base condensation reaction of pyridoxal 5-phosphate with 1,2-phenylenediamine. BPPP has the properties of high fluorescence stability, good water solubility and low toxicity. Its maximum excitation wavelength and maximum fluorescence emission wavelength are at 389 and 448 nm, respectively. When BPPP coexists with copper (II), its fluorescence is dramatically quenched. Under a certain condition, the fluorescence intensity decreased proportionally to the concentration of copper (II) by the quenching effect. Based on this fact, we established a fluorescence quenching method for the determination of copper (II). Under optimal conditions a linear range was found to be 0.5-50 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.2 ng/mL. The method has been applied to determine copper (II) in foodstuff samples and the analytical results show good agreement with that obtained from atomic absorption spectrometry method. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.
