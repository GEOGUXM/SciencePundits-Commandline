The carbonate oil field studied is a currently producing field in U.S., which is named "PSU" field to remain anonymity. Discovered in 1994 with wells on natural flow or through artificial lift, this field had produced 17.8×106 bbl of oil to date. It was noticed that gas oil ratio had increased in certain parts and oil production declined with time. This study was undertaken to better understand and optimize management and operation of this field. In this brief, we first reviewed the geology, petrophysical properties, and field production history of PSU field. We then evaluated current production histories with decline curve analysis, developed a numerical reservoir model through matching production and pressure data, then carried out parametric studies to investigate the impact of injection rate, injection locations, and timing of injection, and finally developed optimized improved oil recovery (OIR) methods based on ultimate oil recovery and economics. This brief provides an addition to the list of carbonate fields available in the petroleum literature and also improved understandings of Smackover formation and similar analogous fields. By documenting key features of carbonated oil field performances, we help petroleum engineers, researchers, and students understand carbonate reservoir performances. Copyright © 2015 by ASME.
