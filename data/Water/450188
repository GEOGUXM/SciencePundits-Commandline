In this study, bilayered nanofibrous mats (BNFs) were fabricated through sequential electrospinning of polyurethane and gelatin. Due to the bilayered construction and individual performance of each layer, the obtained BNFs show different surface wettability in double layers. Meanwhile, BNFs have desirable thermally regulated water vapor transmission rate, water-absorption ratio and adhesive force between the two layers. In addition, the BNFs show satisfactory antibacterial activity and hemostatic property. Therefore, the prepared BNFs can be used as novel wound dressings. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
