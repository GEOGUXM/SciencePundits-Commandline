In this work, we have prepared film sensor elements based on a hybrid system poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-porous silicon nanocrystals-carbon nanotubes on flexible polymer substrates. Our FTIR spectroscopy-based studies for the molecular structure of the materials obtained suggest some interaction of their components in the hybrid layer. The influence of adsorption of water molecules on the conductivity and capacitance of the hybrid composites has been investigated in the temperature range of 20°C to 40°C. We have detected essential changes in the electrical conductivity and capacitance which depend on the humidity of the surrounding atmosphere. For estimating the sensing properties of our composites, we have analyzed the sensing abilities of the hybrid systems and their dynamic characteristics. The hybrid composites as working materials for the sensors provide improved performance of the latter. In particular, the response time is reduced by 3 to 5 times.
