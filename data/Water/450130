The release of hydrogen sulfide (H<inf>2</inf>S) during sludge drying is a major environmental problem because of its toxicity to human health. A series of experiments were performed to investigate the mechanisms and factors controlling the H<inf>2</inf>S release. Results of this study show that: (1) the biomass and activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in sludge were the major factors controlling the amount of H<inf>2</inf>S release, (2) the sludge drying temperature had an important effect on both the extent and the timing of H<inf>2</inf>S release from the sludge, and (3) decreasing sludge pH increased the H<inf>2</inf>S release. Based on the findings from this study, a new system that integrates sludge drying and H<inf>2</inf>S gas treatment was developed, by which 97.5% of H<inf>2</inf>S and 99.7% of smoke released from sludge treatments was eliminated.
