Large-scale, vertically aligned AgSbS<inf>2</inf> modified ZnO nanotube arrays have been fabricated directly on conducting glass substrates (ITO) via a facile, versatile and low-cost hydrothermal chemical process by using ZnO nanorods as reactive templates. This method is easy to be controlled to develop uniform morphology, and it can be generalized to fabricate other ternary sensitizer nanomaterial for PEC water splitting. In this work, we present a novel ternary sensitizer miargyrite AgSbS<inf>2</inf> for optimized ZnO, and the ZnO/AgSbS<inf>2</inf> nanoarrays film was applied on photoelectrochemical (PEC) photoelectrodes. Strikingly, the photocurrent density of this electrode was up to 5.08 mA cm-2 at 0.096V versus Ag/AgCl. The excellent PEC properties stems from the enhanced absorption spectrum, high speed of photo-induced charges transmission velocity and appropriate energy gap of coupled nanostructures. Furthermore, this work demonstrates a promising low-cost method for preparing ternary sensitizer modified ZnO nanoarrays as PEC electodes for hydrogen production by water splitting.
