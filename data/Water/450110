Abstract Bisphenol A (BPA) is a kind of carcinogen, which can interfere with the body's endocrine system. In this paper, a new kind of fluorescent sensor for BPA detection was established based on the fluorescent conjugated polymer PPESO<inf>3</inf>. The oxidative product of BPA is able to quench PPESO<inf>3</inf> in the presence of HRP and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, and the quenched PL intensity of PPESO<inf>3</inf> was proportionally to the concentration of BPA in the range of 1-100 μmol/L with a detection limit of 4 × 10-7 mol/L. The proposed method has been applied to detect BPA in eight food packaging samples with satisfactory results. The proposed method has the potential for the assay of BPA in food or food packaging samples. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
