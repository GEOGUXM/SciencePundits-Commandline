A new nanocomposite, called FPPB, was prepared by the in situ synthesis of a Prussian blue (PB) nanocrystal within Fe3+ crosslinking poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) resin for the highly efficient and rapid separation of radiocesium from water. The adsorption of Cs+ by FPPB follows the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm model with distribution coefficients touched 1.15×105mL/g and a good adsorption capacity of 72.47mg/g (pH≈7). FPPB displays high adsorption capacity for Cs+ capture under a wide pH range (4.0-10). The kinetics of Cs+ uptake by FPPB is fast (>90% elimination capacity of relatively low Cs+ concentrations during only 20min of Cs+/FPPB contact) and fit well with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. This should be attributed to the high dispersion of PB nanoparticles. The adsorption Cs+ from complex solutions containing various competitive cations in large excess was also effective. FPPB is a cost-effective sorbent and could be developed by only stirring using environmental friendly and inexpensive materials at room temperature. Furthermore, the FPPB-Cs+ can be easily retrieved from water with sieve. It is expected that the as-prepared FPPB has extensive applicability in the elimination of radiocesium from nuclear wastewater. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
