Abstract Solar stills are simple device used for desalination of water in areas with the scarcity potable water. The principle used for distilling water is by natural evaporation and condensation. Since solar radiation is free, abundant and available and this device has many advantages such as uncomplicated fabrication from readily available materials and maintenance free operation minimal with labor required. The efficiencies of single basin solar still's reviewed in this paper are in the range of 30-45%, and with a fresh water productivity of less than 5 L/m2/day. The different design of single basin passive solar still is used to increase the productivity rate of still. There are many different types of solar stills of which detailed review was done on certain special design inculcated in the fabrication, which enhanced both the efficiency and productivity.
