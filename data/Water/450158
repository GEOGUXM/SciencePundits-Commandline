Nowadays electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is mainly adopted for detecting dielectrics of low permittivity in chemical and petroleum industries. In these fields, to meet the demand of measuring capacitances within the range of low values, ECT still needs relatively high requirements of designing its system. In this work, an ECT system is simplified to probe anomalous objects in water with high permittivity. Additionally, the relative change ratio (RCR) of capacitances is presented for image reconstruction in terms of the high permittivity background. RCR is the change value of a capacitance divided by its background value. To verify the effectiveness of the simplification of an ECT system and the method of RCR for image reconstruction, simulations and experiments associated with media of high permittivity (i.e. water) were conducted. The obtained results demonstrate that the simplified ECT system based on RCRs of simulated and measured capacitances is capable of effectively probing anomalous objects in tap-water and sodium chloride solutions with different concentrations. Therefore the RCR is recommended when the sensing domain of ECT is of the high permittivity background. Besides the simplification of ECT systems can be appealing and beneficial to introduced ECT into other fields associated with water flows, such as hydrology, hydrogeology, hydroponics, environment science, etc. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
