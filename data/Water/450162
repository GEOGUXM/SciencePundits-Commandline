Observations were made relevant to common situations involving the service of various sparkling waters. Bubble dynamics and progressive losses of dissolved CO<inf>2</inf> were closely examined in three various batches of carbonated waters holding different levels of CO<inf>2</inf>. During the turbulences of the pouring process, a cloud of bubbles appears in the water bulk. Under the action of buoyancy, bubbles progressively reach the free surface, and the cloud of bubbles finally vanishes. Bubbles also nucleate on the glass wall, where they grow by diffusion until buoyancy forces them to detach and rise to the free surface to release their CO<inf>2</inf>. The three batches of sparkling waters were clearly differentiated with regard to their bubbles dynamics and losses of dissolved CO<inf>2</inf>. Our observations were systematically rationalized and discussed on the basis of mass transfer considerations including molecular diffusion, basic concepts of gas solution thermodynamic equilibrium, and bubble dynamics.
