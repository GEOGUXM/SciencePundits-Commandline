This paper reports a simple fluorescent assay for the determination of Hg2+ and Pb2+ by using a DNA intercalator GeneFinder™ (GF) and an integrated functional nucleic acid (FNA). In the absence of Hg2+ and Pb2+, GF intercalated with the FNA and released moderate strong fluorescence. While in the presence of Hg2+ or Pb2+, the FNA would be induced to form T-Hg2+-T or G-quadruplex structure, interacted with which the GF would exhibit extremely strong or very weak fluorescence. By monitoring the fluorescence changes upon addition of these two ions, the Hg2+ and Pb2+ could be selectively detected as low as 3.23ppb and 2.62ppb. As the main advantage of this assay is simplicity and the feasibility was demonstrated by detecting Hg2+ and Pb2+ in spiked water samples, this assay holds great potential for the development of a cost effective and useful tool for environmental monitoring. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
