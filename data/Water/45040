A hybrid nanolaminates consisting of Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>/ZrO<inf>2</inf>/alucone (aluminum alkoxides with carbon-containing backbones) grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) were reported for an encapsulation of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The electrical Ca test in this study was designed to measure the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of nanolaminates. We found that moisture barrier performance was improved with the increasing of the number of dyads (Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>/ZrO<inf>2</inf>/alucone) and the WVTR reached 8.5 × 10−5 g/m2/day at 25°C, relative humidity (RH) 85%. The half lifetime of a green OLED with the initial luminance of 1,500 cd/m2 reached 350 h using three pairs of the Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> (15 nm)/ZrO<inf>2</inf> (15 nm)/alucone (80 nm) as encapsulation layers. © 2015, Zhang et al.; licensee Springer.
