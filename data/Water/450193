An investigation was made into the fatigue properties of L485MB (X70) pipeline steel after 13yr of exploitation as a crude oil pipeline material. Fatigue tests in zero-to-tension loading were carried out (i) in air, (ii) in crude oil, (iii) in a mixture of crude oil with rainwater, and (iv) in water separated from the crude oil phase. The aim of the investigation was to assess the degree of degradation of the fatigue properties of this steel due to the action of environments typical for crude oil processing and transport. The results are not directly comparable to any corrosion fatigue experienced by the crude oil pipeline, since the strain rate for the tests was higher by an order of five than the strain rate observed in typical loading cycles. The results showed that crude oil and a mixture of crude oil with rainwater had no aggressive effect on the steel in the sense of reducing its fatigue characteristics, while the separated water had an aggressive effect.
