Ethanol production by Saccharomyces cerevisiae NP 01 from sweet sorghum juice was conducted under nutrient supplementation and/or aeration conditions. Yeast extract (YE) and dried spent yeast (DSY) were used as nitrogen supplements. Under high gravity (HG, ~200gl-1 of total sugar) conditions, the addition of either 6gl-1 of YE or 9gl-1 of DSY did not increase the ethanol concentration (P), but it promoted the rate of ethanol production or ethanol productivity (Q<inf>p</inf>). The Q<inf>p</inf> value of the control treatment (no supplement) was 1.96gl-1h-1. The P (93.4-94.0gl-1) and Q<inf>p</inf> (3.89-3.92gl-1h-1) values under the YE and DSY supplementation were comparable, indicating that DSY could be used to replace YE in ethanol production. Under very high gravity (VHG, ~280gl-1 of total sugar) conditions, the supplementation of nitrogen and trace elements (Zn2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+) coupled with the aeration supply were required to improve the ethanol production efficiency. Under the supplementation (in gl-1) of DSY (13.5), Zn2+ (0.01), Mg2+ (0.05) and Mn2+ (0.04) in the presence of aeration supply at 0.05vvm for 12h, the P and Q<inf>p</inf> values were 126.3gl-1 and 2.11gl-1h-1, respectively. The P and Q<inf>p</inf> values under the same supplementation without aeration were 114.8gl-1 and 1.91gl-1h-1, respectively, and these values under no supplementation and no aeration were 108.0gl-1 and 1.50gl-1h-1, respectively. In addition, glycerol (the main by-product during ethanol fermentation) under aeration conditions was ~3gl-1 lower than that without aeration. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
