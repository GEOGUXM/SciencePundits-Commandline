Surfacted ferrofluid (S-FF) is a stable colloid dispersion of magnetic nanoparticles in a carrier liquid which possesses magnetic properties and fluidity simultaneously. Specifically in S-FF coating magnetic nanoparticles with a suitable surfactant provides steric repulsions to prevent particles agglomeration. Selecting the function of surfactant can be engineered according to its application. In the present study, for the first time the application of S-FF in dispersive solid phase extraction of methylene blue (as a cationic dye model) in water and shrimp samples was investigated. For this purpose, in order to use ionic liquid as carrier fluid, the surface of Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> nanoparticles was coated by an anionic surfactant in a polar medium to form a hydrophilic layer around magnetic nanoparticles. In addition to hydrophobic interactions between the analyte and carbonic chain of surfactant, the retention of cationic dye was mainly governed by attractive electrostatic interactions between polar head of surfactant and dye. Under optimized conditions, the relative standard deviation is 2.9%, the limit of detection is 2.5 μg L-1, and the preconcentration factor is 135. ©2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
