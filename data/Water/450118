A series of Co<inf>x</inf>Mn<inf>3-x</inf>O<inf>4</inf> particles as Fenton-like solid catalysts were synthesized, and their catalytic performance in oxidative degradation of organic dye compounds in water was investigated. The surface morphology and structure of the Co<inf>x</inf>Mn<inf>3-x</inf>O<inf>4</inf> catalysts were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that, as an oxide composite of Co and Mn elements, CoMn<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> showed much stronger catalytic activity in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) oxidation than Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>, Mn<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3,</inf> and their physical mixture. Typically, the uses of 0.02g/dm3 CoMn<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> and 0.2g/dm3 PMS yielded a nearly complete removal of Rhodamine B (0.03g/dm3) in 80min at 25°C. The efficiency of Rhodamine B decomposition increased with increasing temperature (15-55 °C), but decreased with the increase of fulvic acid concentration (0-0.08g/dm3). Furthermore, CoMn<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> could maintain its catalytic activity in the repeated batch experiments. Moreover, HO and SO<inf>4</inf>- radicals participating in the process were evidenced using quenching experiments, and a rational mechanism was proposed. PMS oxidation with CoMn<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> is an efficient technique for remediation of organic contaminants in wastewater. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
