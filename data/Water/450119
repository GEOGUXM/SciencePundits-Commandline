The present paper seeks to develop a simple method for the spectrophotometric determination of nitrite in soil and water samples and also measure optimum reaction conditions along with other analytical parameters. The method is based on the diazotization-coupling reaction of nitrite with cefixime and 1-naphthylamine in an acidic solution (Griess reaction). The final product that is an azo dye has an orange color with maximum absorption at 360 nm which Beer's Law is obeyed over the concentration range 0.02-15.00 mg L-1 of nitrite. Optimal conditions of the variables affecting the reaction were obtained by central composite design (CCD). A detection limit of 4.3 × 10-3 mg L-1 was obtained for determination of nitrite by the proposed method. The proposed method was successfully applied to determine nitrite in soil and water samples. The molar absorptivity of the product of the reaction and RSD in determination of nitrite in real samples are 4.1 × 103 (L mol-1 cm-1) and lower than 10%, respectively. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.
