In this paper, we study the initial-boundary-value problem for a generalized sixth order Cahn-Hilliard type equation, which describes the separation properties of oil-water mixtures when a substance enforcing the mixing of the phases is added. The optimal control under boundary condition is given and the existence of optimal solution is proved. Â© 2015, Shi et al.; licensee Springer.
