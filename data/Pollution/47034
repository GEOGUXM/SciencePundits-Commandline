Due to its properties and composition, sanitary landfill leachate is one of the major environmental problems concerning water pollution. The optimization of the leachate treatment, in order to fully reduce the negative impact on the environment, is a nowadays challenge. Advanced technologies for the treatment of sanitary landfill leachates have received increasing attention over the past decade. This paper presents a general review of efficient electrochemical technologies developed to decontaminate sanitary landfill leachates. An overview of the fundamental aspects of electrochemical methods, such as electrocoagulation, electro-Fenton and electrochemical oxidation, is provided and updated information on the application of these technologies to sanitary landfill leachates is given. The effect of the main process variables of these electrochemical technologies in the sanitary landfill leachates treatment effectiveness is discussed and a critical analysis of the prime benefits and drawbacks of its application is made.
