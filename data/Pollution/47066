This paper analyses the effects of policy making for air pollution abatement in Spain between 2000 and 2020 under an integrated assessment approach with the AERIS model for number of pollutants (NO<inf>x</inf>/NO<inf>2</inf>, PM<inf>10</inf>/PM<inf>2.5</inf>, O<inf>3</inf>, SO<inf>2</inf>, NH<inf>3</inf> and VOC). The analysis of the effects of air pollution focused on different aspects: compliance with the European limit values of Directive 2008/50/EC for NO<inf>2</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf> for the Spanish air quality management areas; the evaluation of impacts caused by the deposition of atmospheric sulphur and nitrogen on ecosystems; the exceedance of critical levels of NO<inf>2</inf> and SO<inf>2</inf> in forest areas; the analysis of O<inf>3</inf>-induced crop damage for grapes, maize, potato, rice, tobacco, tomato, watermelon and wheat; health impacts caused by human exposure to O<inf>3</inf> and PM<inf>2.5</inf>; and costs on society due to crop losses (O<inf>3</inf>), disability-related absence of work staff and damage to buildings and public property due to soot-related soiling (PM<inf>2.5</inf>). In general, air quality policy making has delivered improvements in air quality levels throughout Spain and has mitigated the severity of the impacts on ecosystems, health and vegetation in 2020 as target year. The findings of this work constitute an appropriate diagnosis for identifying improvement potentials for further mitigation for policy makers and stakeholders in Spain. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
