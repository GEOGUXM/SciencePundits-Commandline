The influence of copper in the mixed spinel Cu<inf>x</inf>Co<inf>3-x</inf>O<inf>4</inf> on the catalytic activity in N<inf>2</inf>O decomposition was investigated under ideal and real reaction conditions. A strong dependency of the catalytic activity on the amount of Cu in Cu<inf>x</inf>Co<inf>3-x</inf>O<inf>4</inf> catalysts was observed. Decreasing the amount of Cu increases the catalytic activity. Aiming for improved activity the influence of doping with alkaline (earth) metals was investigated. The use of potassium as dopant allowed a further increase of the catalysts activity. High activity was found for K-Cu<inf>0.25</inf>Co<inf>2.75</inf>O<inf>4</inf> and full conversion was already reached at 330°C under ideal conditions. The effect of O<inf>2</inf>, NO and H<inf>2</inf>O in the gas mixtures on the decomposition of N<inf>2</inf>O was evaluated. Overall, full N<inf>2</inf>O decomposition could be reached at temperatures as low as 490°C in realistic reaction conditions. Additionally, stability tests emphasise stable activity for at least 60h. Furthermore, no irreversible deactivation even in the presence of NO, O<inf>2</inf> and H<inf>2</inf>O was found. The catalysts were fully characterised by means of XRD, elemental analysis, TGA, TPR and N<inf>2</inf>-physisorption. TPD-O<inf>2</inf> measurements were performed to investigate the influence of the catalyst composition on oxygen vacancies to elucidate the nature of active sites. © 2015.
