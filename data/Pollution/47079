This study investigated the relationship between Pb relative bioavailability (RBA) and bioaccessibility, and their relationships with Pb in different pools in soils. Twelve Pb-contaminated soils representing different contamination sources from China were analyzed for Pb bioaccessibility using four in vitro methods (UBM, SBRC, IVG, and PBET), Pb-RBA using a mouse blood model, and Pb fractionation using sequential extraction. Lead bioaccessibility in the gastric phase (GP) and Pb-RBA was generally lower in mining soils (0.46-29% and 7.0-26%) than smelting (19-92% and 31-84%) and farming soils (13-99% and 51-61%), with more Pb in the residual fraction in mining soils. Lead bioaccessibility varied with assays, with SBRC (3.0-99%) producing significantly higher bioaccessible Pb than other assays (0.46-84%) in the gastric phase. However, Pb bioaccessibility in the intestinal phase (IP) of all assays sharply decreased to 0.01-20% possibly due to Pb sorption to solid phase at higher pH. Lead bioaccessibility by UBM-GP assay was best correlated with Pb-RBA (r2=0.67), followed by IVG-GP (r2=0.55). Among different Pb fractions, strong correlation was found between Pb bioaccessibility/Pb-RBA and the sum of exchangeable and carbonate fractions. Our study suggested that UBM-GP assay has potential to determine Pb bioaccessibility in contaminated soils in China. Â© 2015.
