This study explores the feasibility of excess CO<inf>2</inf> removal from living spaces. Electric-swing adsorption (ESA) splits ambient air into two portions: waste gas for removal and recovery air for recycling back into the living space. Ambient air holds dilute but unacceptable concentrations of CO<inf>2</inf> (selected as 3000ppm in this study), while the waste gas contains higher concentrations. The concentration in the recovered air is below ambient levels. Carbon monolith functions as an adsorbent and direct heating resistance material. Cooling is accomplished by the convective flow of ambient air. The computational model and preliminary tests establish ways to quantify the separation characteristics and thermal response of the monolith. Based on the ESA steps identified with the single monolith, a prototype of a two-bed device is built to demonstrate the cyclical operation of multiple beds with phase shift. The electrical energy requirement for treating air containing 3000ppm CO<inf>2</inf> is in the range of 57.8kJ/(m3 air) under the selected temperature swing of 20°C. This requirement indicates that further refinement is essential for practical application. However, the overall findings are in agreement with the well-established fact that the concentration of CO<inf>2</inf> is the most important factor affecting energy consumption, especially when the mole fraction of CO<inf>2</inf> is less than 0.15. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
