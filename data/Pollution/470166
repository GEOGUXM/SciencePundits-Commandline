Electro-peroxone (E-peroxone) is a novel electrocatalytic ozonation process that combines ozonation and electrolysis process to enhance pollutant degradation during water and wastewater treatment. This enhancement has been mainly attributed to several mechanisms that increase O<inf>3</inf> transformation to OH in the E-peroxone system, e.g., electro-generation of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> from O<inf>2</inf> at a carbon-based cathode and its subsequent peroxone reaction with O<inf>3</inf> to OH, electro-reduction of O<inf>3</inf> to OH at the cathode, and O<inf>3</inf> decomposition to OH at high local pH near the cathode. To get more insight how these mechanisms contribute respectively to the enhancement, this study investigated total organic carbon (TOC) elimination from oxalic acid (OA) solutions by the E-peroxone process. Results show that the E-peroxone process significantly increased TOC elimination rate by 10.2-12.5 times compared with the linear addition of the individual rates of corresponding ozonation and electrolysis process. Kinetic analyses reveal that the electrochemically-driven peroxone reaction is the most important mechanism for the enhanced TOC elimination rate, while the other mechanisms contribute minor to the enhancement by a factor of 1.6-2.5. The results indicate that proper selection of electrodes that can effectively produce H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> at the cathode is critical to maximize TOC elimination in the E-peroxone process.
