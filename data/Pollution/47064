Sustainable H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> supply and cost-effective elimination of residual H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> are two key challenges associated with the successful application of Fenton reaction for contaminant removal. In this study, an innovative Bioelectro-Fenton system capable of alternate switching between microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) and microbial fuel cell (MFC) mode of operation was developed to meet the challenges. In the MEC mode, a bioelectrochemical system (BES) produces H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> which reacts with Fenton's reagent (Fe II) to form hydroxyradical. The unused H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> (residual H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>) is removed as electron acceptor by switching the system to MFC mode of operation. Complete decolorization and mineralization of 50 mg L-1 methylene blue (MB) was achieved in the MEC mode with apparent first order rate constants of 0.43 and 0.22 h-1, respectively. After switching to the MFC mode, residual H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> of 180 mg L-1 was removed at a removal rate of 4.61 mg L-1 h-1 while generating a maximum current density of 0.49 A m-2. The MB degradation and residual H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> removal were affected by external resistance, cathode pH and initial MB concentration. Furthermore, the system performance was enhanced under stack operation. This study provides a proof-in-concept new system for efficient and cost-effective H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> control and recalcitrant pollutants removal. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
