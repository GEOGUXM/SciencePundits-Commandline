The performance of glassy carbon electrodes (GCE) coated with multi-walled carbon nanotube poly(pyrocatechol violet) composite and bismuth film was investigated as an electrochemical sensor in the simultaneous determination of Cd2+ and Pb2+ ions in a 0.1 M acetate buffer solution at pH = 5.0. The presence of the bismuth film improves the analyte accumulation due to its ability to form a fused alloy with cadmium and lead. It was found that the Bi-film modified electrode shows a better performance than the bare GCE, GCE-MWCNT and GCE-MWCNT/poly(PCV) electrodes. The parameters affecting the stripping current response were investigated and optimized. Under optimal conditions, the electrode showed a good linear response to Cd2+ and Pb2+ in the concentration range of 1.0-300.0 μg L-1 and 1.0-200.0 μg L-1, respectively. The detection limits were 0.20 μg L-1 and 0.40 μg L-1 for Cd2+ and Pb2+, respectively. It was found that the sensor has least interference from most of the common ions due to specific and selective interaction of the modifier functionalities with lead and cadmium ions. The response of the electrode remained constant for at least 3 weeks of successive operation. The proposed method was applied for simultaneous determining Cd2+ and Pb2+ contents in water samples. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
