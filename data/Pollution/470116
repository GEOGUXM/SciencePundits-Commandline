Abstract Sediment samples were collected from the Chaohu Lake basin to investigate the spatial distribution and historical deposition behaviors of 17 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Concentrations of the total PFASs (ΣPFASs) in limnetic sediments ranged from 0.719 to 2.429 ng/g dry weight (dw), with an average of 1.449 ng/g dw. A clear gradient in the spatial distribution was observed from west to east in surface sediments of Lake Chaohu. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid and perfluorooctanoic acid were predominant in limnetic sediments, with an average of 0.383 and 0.275 ng/g dw, respectively. The ΣPFASs concentrations in riverine sediments were the highest in the Shiwuli River, followed by the Nanfei River. PFASs in riverine sediments indicated that industrial discharge and urban runoff played key roles in PFAS distribution and pollution levels. In vertical profiles, concentrations of the ΣPFASs and PFAS congeners in three sediment cores generally increased with decreasing depths, indicating that the input history of the ΣPFASs could be attributed to the development of industrialization and urbanization in the Chaohu Lake basin. The correlations between PFASs and sedimentary characteristics, organic carbon, nutrients and inorganic salts suggested that both hydrophobic and electrostatic effects played important roles in PFAS distribution and pollution levels in sediments of Lake Chaohu. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
