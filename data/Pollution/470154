A nanowire-directed templating solution-based synthesis strategy was developed to selectively prepare uniform CeO2 nanotubes and heterostructured nanowires by fine-tuning surface chemistry of K1.33Mn8O16 nanowires. The morphology of CeO2 nanotubes and the decorative growth of solid CeO2 particles on K1.33Mn8O16 nanowires changed as the concentration of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) was altered. The resultant porous CeO2 nanotubes showed excellent water purification performance for oxalic acid-induced photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) under UV light irradiation at room temperature. The enhanced ability for Cr(VI) photoreduction on the obtained CeO2 nanotubes were investigated. Our findings provide a new means to chemically controlled growth of CeO2 nanostructures and demonstrate a highly robust and potential material for the purification of Cr(VI) polluted water.
