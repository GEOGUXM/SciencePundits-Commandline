The Reduced Life Expectancy (RLE) Model (LC<inf>50</inf> = [ln(NLE) - ln(LT<inf>50</inf>)]/d) has been proposed as an alternative to Haber's Rule. The model is based on a linear relationship between LC<inf>50</inf> (Lethal Exposure Concentration) and lnLT<inf>50</inf> (Lethal Exposure Time) and uses NLE (Normal Life Expectancy) as a limiting point as well as a long term data point (where d is a constant). The purposes of this paper were to compare the RLE Model with Haber's Rule with available toxicity data and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. When LT<inf>50</inf> is relatively short and LC<inf>50</inf> is high, Haber's Rule is consistent with the RLE model. But the difference between the two was evident in the situation when LT<inf>50</inf> is relatively long and LC<inf>50</inf> is low where the RLE model is a marked departure from Haber's Rule. The RLE Model can be used to appropriately evaluate long term effects of exposure. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
