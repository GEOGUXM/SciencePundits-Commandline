Suisun Marsh, in northern San Francisco Bay, is the largest brackish marsh in California, and provides critical habitat for many fish species. Storm runoff enters the marsh through many creeks that drain agricultural uplands and the urban areas of Fairfield and Suisun City. Five creeks were sampled throughout a major storm event in February 2014, and analyzed for representatives of several major insecticide classes. Concentrations were greatest in creeks with urban influence, though sampling was done outside of the primary season for agricultural pesticide use. Urban creek waters reached maximum concentrations of 9.9. ng/l bifenthrin, 27.4. ng/l fipronil, 11.9. ng/l fipronil sulfone, 1462. ng/l imidacloprid, and 4.0. ng/l chlorpyrifos. Water samples were tested for toxicity to Hyalella azteca and Chironomus dilutus, and while few samples caused mortality, 70% of the urban creek samples caused paralysis of either or both species. Toxic unit analysis indicated that bifenthrin was likely responsible for effects to H. azteca, and fipronil and its sulfone degradate were responsible for effects to C. dilutus. These results demonstrate the potential for co-occurrence of multiple insecticides in urban runoff, each with the potential for toxicity to particular species, and the value of toxicity monitoring using multiple species. In the channels of Suisun Marsh farther downstream, insecticide concentrations and toxicity diminished as creek waters mixed with brackish waters entering from San Francisco Bay. Only fipronil and its degradates remained measurable at 1-10. ng/l. These concentrations are not known to present a risk based on existing data, but toxicity data for estuarine and marine invertebrates, particularly for fipronil's degradates, are extremely limited.
