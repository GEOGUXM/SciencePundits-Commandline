In our previous studies, CuCl<inf>2</inf> demonstrated excellent Hg(0) oxidation capability and holds potential for Hg(0) oxidation in coal-fired power plants. In this study, the properties and performances of CuCl<inf>2</inf> supported onto γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> with high surface area were investigated. From various characterization techniques using XPS, XAFS, XRD, TPR, SEM and TGA, the existence of multiple copper species was identified. At low CuCl<inf>2</inf> loadings, CuCl<inf>2</inf> forms copper aluminate species with γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> and is inactive for Hg(0) oxidation. At high loadings, amorphous CuCl<inf>2</inf> forms onto the γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> surface, working as a redox catalyst for Hg(0) oxidation by consuming Cl to be converted into CuCl and then being regenerated back into CuCl<inf>2</inf> in the presence of O<inf>2</inf> and HCl gases. The 10%(wt) CuCl<inf>2</inf>/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> catalyst showed excellent Hg(0) oxidation performance and SO<inf>2</inf> resistance at 140°C under simulated flue gas conditions containing 6%(v) O<inf>2</inf> and 10ppmv HCl. The oxidized Hg(0) in the form of HgCl<inf>2</inf> has a high solubility in water and can be easily captured by other air pollution control systems such as wet scrubbers in coal-fired power plants. The CuCl<inf>2</inf>/γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> catalyst can be used as a low temperature Hg(0) oxidation catalyst. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
