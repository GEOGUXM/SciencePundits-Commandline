Regional ozone pollution has become a major environmental concern in China, especially in densely populated and economically vibrant regions such as North China, including Beijing. To address this issue, surface ozone and its precursors (CO, NO, and NO<inf>2</inf>) from December 2012 to November 2013 at 12 sites in urban Beijing and 2 sites in suburban Beijing were analyzed. The annual average concentrations of O<inf>3</inf>, CO, NO, and NO<inf>2</inf> in urban Beijing were 45.5±50.2μgm-3, 1.5±1.3mgm-3, 27.3±42.7μgm-3, and 58.3+32.0μgm-3, respectively. The concentration of ozone was highest during summer, whereas concentrations of its precursors were highest during winter. Diurnal variations in ozone presented as a single-peak curve, with the peak appearing at about 15:00-16:00. Diurnal variations in most ozone precursors showed bimodal curves; the first peak appeared at about 08:00-09:00, and the second peak appeared at night. Hourly concentrations of ozone on the weekend were higher than those on weekdays between 11:00 and 24:00 in urban Beijing, which was suggestive of a significant weekend effect. This may be because NO inhibition on the weekend is weaker than that on weekdays during the ozone formation phase. Diurnal variations in O<inf>X</inf> (NO<inf>2</inf>+O<inf>3</inf>) showed a single peak, which appeared at 15:00 or 16:00. The results of correlation analysis among O<inf>X</inf>, O<inf>3</inf>, and NO<inf>2</inf> suggested that O<inf>X</inf> was mainly controlled by O<inf>3</inf> during the day and by NO<inf>2</inf> during the night throughout the year. O<inf>X</inf> was controlled by NO<inf>2</inf> during both the day and night during winter due to the low concentration of O<inf>3</inf>. The regional transport of ozone along the upwind direction was found in a typical ozone pollution event in summer in Beijing. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
