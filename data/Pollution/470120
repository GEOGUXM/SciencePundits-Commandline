Abstract The historical record (1859-2011) of magnetic susceptibility, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, δ13C<inf>org</inf>, δ15N, As, Cd, Hg, Pb, and organochlorine pesticide (OCP) signatures in Baiyangdian Lake was used to analyze the water environmental changes due to human activities. The results indicate the following: the status of the lake approaches the background condition in 1859-1950s; the lake suffered increasing anthropogenic effects from the 1950s because of increasing human activities such as coal-fired power plant operations since 1958, fertilizer use in the agriculture and land transformation since the 1950s, steelmaking between the 1960s and 1970s, machinery manufacturing since the 1970s, use of petrol containing alky-lead since 1990; the lake has been in a contaminated condition since the 2000s. This study confirms that OCPs have been effectively controlled in the area, the level of nutrient and heavy metal pollution is increasing, coal-fired power plants are an important source of Hg, and the use of petrol containing alky-lead has accelerated the accumulation of Pb in the environment. The study indicates that magnetic susceptibility can be used as a rapid, simple, and non-destructive tool for assessment of organic and heavy metal pollution in the lake. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
