The phycoremediation process has great potential for effectively addressing environmental pollution. To explore the capabilities of simultaneous algal nutrient removal, CO<inf>2</inf> mitigation and biofuel feedstock production from spent water resources, a Chlorogonium sp. isolated from a tilapia pond in Hong Kong was grown in non-sterile saline sewage effluent for a bioremediation study. With high removal efficiencies of NH<inf>3</inf>-N (88.35±14.39%), NO<inf>3</inf>--N (85.39±14.96%), TN (93.34±6.47%) and PO<inf>4</inf>3--P (91.80±17.44%), Chlorogonium sp. achieved a CO<inf>2</inf> consumption rate of 58.96mgL-1d-1, which was optimised by the response surface methodology. Under optimised conditions, the lipid content of the algal biomass reached 24.26±2.67%. Overall, the isolated Chlorogonium sp. showed promising potential in the simultaneous purification of saline sewage effluent in terms of tertiary treatment and CO<inf>2</inf> sequestration while delivering feedstock for potential biofuel production in a waste-recycling manner. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
