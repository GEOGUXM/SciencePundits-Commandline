Herein, we present the successful synthesis of a new graphene oxide-doped-oxygen-rich TiO<inf>2</inf> (GO-OTiO<inf>2</inf>) hybrid heterostructure through a facile wet chemical impregnation technique. The photocatalytic performances of all samples were evaluated through the photoreduction of CO<inf>2</inf> under the irradiation of low-power energy-saving daylight bulbs. Pure oxygen-rich TiO<inf>2</inf> (O<inf>2</inf>-TiO<inf>2</inf>) was first prepared via a simple aqueous peroxo-titanate route. The as-prepared photocatalyst was shown to exhibit reduced band gap energy and visible-light-active characteristics. However, the photoactivity of bare O<inf>2</inf>-TiO<inf>2</inf> was found to gradually deteriorate over time. Hence, by exploiting its unique properties, graphene oxide (GO) was subsequently incorporated with the O<inf>2</inf>-TiO<inf>2</inf> photocatalyst. It was observed that the photostability of the resulting GO-OTiO<inf>2</inf> composite was significantly enhanced, where it maintained a reactivity of 95.8% even after 6h of light irradiation. This observation firmly established the role of GO as an effective catalyst mat for O<inf>2</inf>-TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles where it accepted photoinduced electrons and reduced the probability of charge recombination. In the CO<inf>2</inf> photoreduction experiments, 5GO-OTiO<inf>2</inf> with an optimum GO loading of 5wt.%, exhibited the highest photoactivity, achieving a total CH<inf>4</inf> yield of 1.718μmol/g<inf>cat</inf> after 6h of reaction. The total product yield obtained over 5GO-OTiO<inf>2</inf> was found to be 14.0 folds higher in comparison to commercial Degussa P25. In overall, we systematically demonstrated an unprecedented proof-of-concept study on enhancing the photoactivity of GO-OTiO<inf>2</inf> via a combined strategy of fabricating visible-light-responsive O<inf>2</inf>-TiO<inf>2</inf> and increasing its photostability by incorporating GO sheets. © 2015.
