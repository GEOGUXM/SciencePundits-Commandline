The study was aimed at the prediction of structural factors influencing the aromaticity of typical single-benzene ring water pollutants, as well as their photooxidative intermediates, using structure-activity relationship modeling. UV absorbance (A) at 254nm and 280nm, along with the total organic carbon (TOC) values, were determined for 30 compounds structured of single benzene ring possessing different types, numbers, and positions of substitutes. These single-benzene ring pollutants were afterwards submitted to photooxidative treatment by UV-C/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> process, where A and TOC values in reference treatment periods (RTPs) were determined in order to estimate the aromaticity of formed intermediates. The aromaticity of both parent pollutants and their photooxidative intermediates formed in RTPs were expressed by means of specific UV absorbance (SUVA) values. Such calculated SUVA values were taken as response values in QSPR modeling in order to establish key structural features of studied single-benzene ring pollutants contributing to the aromaticity changes during applied UV-C/H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> process. Within QSPR modeling, a genetic algorithm and multiple linear regression analysis were applied for the selection of descriptors representing structural characteristics of the studied compounds, and to generate the correlation models. The 3- and 4-variable models were found to be most predictive for SUVA<inf>254</inf> and SUVA<inf>280</inf> values, clearly reflecting contributing structural characteristics of the studied compounds toward aromaticity and corresponding changes occurring during their photooxidative treatment.
