Over the last decades, an increase of pollutants of diverse origin (industrial, military, mining, etc.) was recorded in several areas of Sardinia Island. We report the results of a multidisciplinary and complementary study based on cytogenetic and physiological analyses. The data obtained show the effects of the environmental impact on six sheep flocks (Sardinian breed) grazing on natural pasturelands next to possible polluted areas and compared to three herds grazing in different areas far from those potentially contaminated and used as control. Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test was used as cytogenetic test to analyze chromosomal damages and it was performed on peripheral blood samples collected from 129 adult sheep (age. >. 4. years) randomly selected from polluted (92 animals) and control (37 animals) areas. Two types of cell cultures were performed: without (normal cultures) and with the addition of 5-BrdU. SCE-mean values estimated over 35 cells counted for each animal were 8.65. ±. 3.40, 8.10. ±. 3.50, 8.05. ±. 3.08, 7.42. ±. 3.34, 9.28. ±. 3.56 and 8.38. ±. 3.29 in the exposed areas, whereas the average values were 7.86. ±. 3.31 in the control group. Significant increases (P. <. 0.01) of SCEs were found in three investigated areas of Southern Sardinia. Furthermore, sheep of the same flocks were characterized for blood redox homeostasis in order to define the potential targets of oxidative damage and to identify biomarkers of the extent of animal exposure to environmental contaminants. The plasma levels of Asc, Toc and Ret were found to be significantly lower (P. <. 0.001) in exposed sheep (I, II, IV and V) than in the control group. TAC as well as GPx and SOD activities were higher in control than in the exposed groups (P. <. 0.001). Finally, plasma levels of N-Tyr, PC, and LPO were significantly lower (P. <. 0.001) in the control group than in the exposed groups. © 2015.
