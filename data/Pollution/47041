This study assessed the synthesis and application of nano-Fe/Ca/CaO-based composite material for use as a separation and immobilizing treatment of dry soil contaminated by stable (133Cs) and radioactive cesium species (134Cs and 137Cs). After grinding with nano-Fe/CaO, nano-Fe/Ca/CaO, and nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/[PO<inf>4</inf>], approximately 31, 25, and 22wt% of magnetic fraction soil was separated. Their resultant 133Cs immobilization values were about 78, 81, and 100%, respectively. When real radioactive cesium contaminated soil obtained from Fukushima was treated with nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/[PO<inf>4</inf>], approximately 27.3wt% of magnetic and 72.75% of non-magnetic soil fractions were separated. The highest amount of entrapped 134Cs and 137Cs was found in the lowest weight of the magnetically separated soil fraction (i.e., 80% in 27.3% of treated soil). Results show that 134Cs and 137Cs either in the magnetic or non-magnetic soil fractions was 100% immobilized. The morphology and mineral phases of the nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/[PO<inf>4</inf>] treated soil were characterized using SEM-EDS, EPMA, and XRD analysis. The EPMA and XRD patterns indicate that the main fraction of enclosed/bound materials on treated soil included Ca/PO<inf>4</inf> associated crystalline complexes. These results suggest that simple grinding treatment with nano-Fe/Ca/CaO/[PO<inf>4</inf>] under dry conditions might be an extremely efficient separation and immobilization method for radioactive cesium contaminated soil.
