A new visible-light-driven photocatalyst, monoclinic dibismuth tetraoxide (m-Bi<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf>), has been discovered. This simple oxide with mixed valent states (Bi3+ and Bi5+) has a band gap energy of 2.0eV, and is responsive to wavelength up to 620nm. The first-principle calculations within the hybrid density functional framework (HSE) indicate that m-Bi<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> is a typical indirect-gap semiconductor. It shows much higher photocatalytic degradation activity as well as photostability than some of the well-investigated highly efficient photocatalysts, such as CdS and Bi<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>. Not only typical dyes and colorless aromatic compounds, including rhodamine B, methyl orange, methyl blue, phenol and 4-nitrophenol, but also bacterial (Escherichia coli) cells can be effectively degraded/inactivated in the presence of m-Bi<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf>. The electronic potential of band structure is studied and a photocatalytic mechanism is also proposed, in which both OH and direct h+ oxidation play important roles in the degradation process. Our discovery highlights the potential of developing Bi<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-based photocatalysts as a new class of highly active, stable and safe photocatalyst for versatile pollutant degradation and disinfection under visible light.
