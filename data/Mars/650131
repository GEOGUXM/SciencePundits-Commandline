Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) hyperspectral data have a spatial resolution ranging from 12 to 36 m/pixel allowing the high-resolution mapping of minerals at the surface of Mars. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) makes the discrimination of minerals with close spectral signature such as hydrated minerals challenging. We describe here a pipeline to be used as complement to CRISM Analysis Toolkit (CAT) together with different ratioing methods used to highlight the signal. We present tests on library spectra artificially noised as well as on CRISM data. These tests show that our pipeline is efficient to improve the visualization and the qualitative analysis CRISM data with an SNR higher than 20.
