Organic carbon (OC) content, elemental (C/N) and isotopic (δ13C) composition of organic matter (OM) constrain relative contributions from both marine and terrestrial sources to modern sediments in the NE Gulf of Cádiz (GoC) shelf. C/N and (δ13C) indicate a transition from a dominantly marine to a terrestrial input of OM deposited in Bay of Cádiz and the Guadalquivir prodelta. OC and mass accumulation rates (MARs, based on bulk density and 210Pb-derived sediment MAR) suggest that labile OM from primary productivity accounts for the low OC content and burial rates in sediments in the NE GoC shelf. © 2015 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary
