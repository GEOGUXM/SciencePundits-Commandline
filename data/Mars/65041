A simple existence criterion of inflection points of the potential in nonuniform spherical bodies is formulated. The criterion states that geometric loci of inflection points of the potential appear not only at density discontinuities but also at locations where the density ρ(r) is two-thirds of the average matter density $$\overline {\rho (r)}$$ inside a sphere of a specified radius. The criterion is universal and is fulfilled as for bodies with a continuous density distribution, and for bodies consisting of layers of finite thickness, and also in mixed models. The method of separation of extreme points method of separation of inflection points is given. The criterion is tested on many models including isothermal, polytropic, and isochronous spheres. The family of models within which there are no inflection points is specified. Testing of the method on the Earth’s model confirms its adequacy. A lower limit for the axial (polar) moment of inertia of a spherical body $$\frac{{I_{cr} }}{{M R^2 }} \approx 0.360$$ that separates planets and moons of the solar system into two groups is also obtained using the 3/2 criterion. The first and the largest group includes celestial bodies that have internal extreme points of the attraction force. The second group consists of planets and satellites that have no internal extreme points. These are the Moon, Io, Phobos, and, significantly, Mars. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.
