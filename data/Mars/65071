A series of bimetallic Fe-Ni/MgAl<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> catalysts with Fe/Ni ratios between 0 and 1.5 have been examined for methane dry reforming at 923-1073 K, atmospheric pressure, and a CH<inf>4</inf>/CO<inf>2</inf> ratio of 1. The evolution of the catalyst structure during H<inf>2</inf> temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), CO<inf>2</inf> temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), and dry reforming is examined using time-resolved in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD). During H<inf>2</inf>-TPR up to 973 K, Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> and NiO are reduced to Fe and Ni. Higher temperatures lead to Fe-Ni alloy formation. The alloy remains stable up to 900 K under CO<inf>2</inf>-TPO and is decomposed to Ni and Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> at higher temperatures. The Fe-Ni alloy is the active phase while Fe partially segregates from the alloy forming FeO<inf>x</inf> during dry reforming. This is beneficial as it reduces the surface carbon accumulation through interaction with FeO<inf>x</inf> lattice oxygen, producing CO. Alternate CH<inf>4</inf> and CO<inf>2</inf> pulse experiments over Ni, Fe, and Ni-Fe samples showed that dry reforming over Fe-Ni catalysts can follow a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. A molar Fe/Ni ratio of 0.7 provides the most active and least deactivated catalyst. All studied catalysts can be regenerated by CO<inf>2</inf> carbon removal. Â© 2015 American Chemical Society.
