Mineral segmentation in thin sections is a challenging, popular, and important research topic in computational geology, mineralogy, and mining engineering. Mineral segmentation in thin sections containing altered minerals, in which there are no evident and close boundaries, is a rather complex process. Most of the thin sections created in industries include altered minerals. However, intelligent mineral segmentation in thin sections containing altered minerals has not been widely investigated in the literature, and the current state of the art algorithms are not able to accurately segment minerals in such thin sections. In this paper, a novel method based on incremental learning for clustering pixels is proposed in order to segment index minerals in both thin sections with and without altered minerals. Our algorithm uses 12 color features that are extracted from thin section images. These features include red, green, blue, hue, saturation and intensity, under plane and cross polarized lights in maximum intensity situation. The proposed method has been tested on 155 igneous samples and the overall accuracy of 92.15% and 85.24% has been obtained for thin sections without altered minerals and thin sections containing altered minerals, respectively. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the results of other similar methods in the literature, especially for segmenting thin sections containing altered minerals. The proposed algorithm could be applied in applications which require a real time segmentation or efficient identification map such as petroleum geology, petrography and NASA Mars explorations.
