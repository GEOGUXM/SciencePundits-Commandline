Northwest Africa (NWA) 7034 is the first breccia meteorite from Mars, and unlike the shergottite, nakhlite, and chassignite (SNC) martian meteorites, it matches the estimated chemical composition of martian crust. Here we show that the visible-infrared reflectance spectrum of NWA 7034 is unique compared to other SNCs and is more similar than them to remotely sensed data from Mars, suggesting the martian regolith may contain significant brecciated material produced during heavy bombardment of the crust.
