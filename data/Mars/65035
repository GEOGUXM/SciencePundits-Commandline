We analyze the recalibrated in situ humidity measurements by the Phoenix lander, which landed at 68.2°N, 234.3°E and operated from Ls 78° through Ls 148°, ~152 sols. Vapor pressures demonstrate significant day-night variations with values ranging from 0.005. Pa to 0.37. Pa, an order of magnitude lower than previously reported, and evening derived enthalpies less than that for a purely ice deposition-driven process, suggesting other water vapor sinks may contribute to the near-surface humidity at the martian polar regions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.
