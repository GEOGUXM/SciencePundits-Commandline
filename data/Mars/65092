The main idea of this study was to find predictive quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) for the therapeutic index of 68 thiazolidin-4-one analogs against Toxoplasma gondii. Multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) together with Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling was proposed as a reliable descriptor subset selection strategy. Basis functions and knot points are also determined for each selected descriptor using generalized cross validation after frequency analysis. Least squares-support vector regression (LS-SVR) with optimized hyper-parameters was employed as mapping tool due to its promising empirical performance. The models were validated and tested through the use of the external prediction set of compounds, leave-one-out and leave-many-out cross validation methods, applicability domain analysis and Y-randomization. The robustness and accuracy of the QSAR models were confirmed by the satisfactory statistical parameters for the experimentally reported dataset (R2 p = 0.853, Q2 LOO = 0.785, R2 L20%O = 0.742 and r2 m = 0.715) and low standard error values (RMSEp = 0.208, RMSELOO = 0.321 and RMSEL20%O = 0.376). The comprehensive analysis carried out in the present contribution using the proposed strategy can provide a considerable basis for the design and development of novel drug-like molecules against T. gondii.
