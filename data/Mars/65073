Objective: Which effects has the interdisciplinary collaboration including pharmacists and psychologists in depressive patients? Methods: In a 3-arm (each N = 10) randomized pilot study, we compared SC (standard care by specialized physicians in a tertiary care center) with SC + pharmaceutical medication management and SC + psychological counselling in respect to the number of drug-drug interactions, guideline conformity, patient knowledge, and medication adherence (according to MARS). Results: The number of drug-drug interactions decreased by the MM up to 67 % (p < 0.05). Guideline conformity was fulfilled in all groups before and after intervention. Patient knowledge and medication adherence were not influenced by additional medication management or psychological counselling. Conclusion: In a greater patient group, these explorative results should now be verified. Â©Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.
