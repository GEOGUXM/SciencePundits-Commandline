Results from simulating the rate of formation of 3He, 21Ne and 36Ar isotopes according to the effect cosmic rays have on the surface layer of the soil on Mars are presented. The results are compared to data obtained by the Mars Science Laboratory for samples of the surface layer. It is shown that with a constant spectrum and an average flow of cosmic rays, the exposure required to explain the experimental data could have been accumulated in only 160–220 million years. The existence of a layer of water at least 8–10 meters thick and/or a dense atmosphere in the period of evolution preceding the irradiation of the tested samples is hypothesized. © 2015, Allerton Press, Inc.
