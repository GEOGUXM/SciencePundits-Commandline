We present morphologic observations and spectral modeling results of a large, kaolin-group mineral-bearing deposit within Kashira crater in the southern highlands of Mars. We employ both non-linear unmixing of Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) visible to near-infrared (VNIR) reflectance data and linear unmixing of Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) thermal infrared (TIR) emissivity data to quantitatively analyze the kaolin-group mineral within this deposit. We use a novel approach for quantitative analysis of CRISM data through non-linear unmixing with in-scene, orbitally-derived endmembers combined with laboratory measured endmembers. Results from this approach indicate that the deposit within Kashira crater is best modeled as a combination of surrounding spectral units (i.e., in-scene derived endmembers) with the addition of the kaolin-group mineral halloysite. Linear unmixing of TES data suggest that the deposit contains ~30% halloysite, a result that is supported by a sensitivity analysis. Potential formation mechanisms for this deposit include hydrothermal alteration, arid-environment pedogenic weathering of a basaltic mound deposit, or pedogenic weathering of a volcanic ash deposit. Our modeling results offer a quantitative reconciliation of the CRISM and TES datasets, and provide a consistent mineralogy from spectral unmixing for an aqueous alteration mineral-bearing deposit on Mars using a combined analysis of both VNIR and TIR hyperspectral data.
