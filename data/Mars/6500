Herein, we report the performance of the catalytic combustion of methane over the Ce-doped SnO<inf>2</inf> catalysts. Doping with Ce increases the surface areas, decreases the crystallite sizes, and activates both the surface metal cations and surface oxygen species. Upon methane combustion, the surface Sn4+ cations are active sites, and the surface lattice oxygen plays an important role, as well. Kinetics results suggest that the activation energy (E<inf>a</inf>) and pre-exponential factor (A) are determined by the reducibility and the area-specific quantity of the surface Sn4+ cations, respectively. The Sn<inf>0.7</inf>Ce<inf>0.3</inf>O<inf>2</inf> catalyst exhibits the highest area-specific rate because of its lowest E<inf>a</inf> and relatively bigger A values. Its turnover frequency is five times higher, as compared with the SnO<inf>2</inf>. The reaction pathways upon the Sn-rich catalysts (SnO<inf>2</inf> phase) follow the Mars-van Krevelen model, while they become more complex upon the Ce-rich ones (CeO<inf>2</inf> phase). Additionally, these SnO<inf>2</inf>-based catalysts display the high water resistance. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V..
