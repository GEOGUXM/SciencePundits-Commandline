The ankylosaurine Pinacosaurus is one of the best known ankylosaur to date in terms of the number and preservational quality of specimens. Juvenile to sub-adult postcrania collected by the Soviet-Mongolian Paleontological Expedition from the Upper Cretaceous Alagteeg Formation at Alag Teeg, Mongolia can be assigned to Pinacosaurus grangeri based on discrete cranial characters. One individual is significantly larger than the others and demonstrates delayed fusion of postcranial elements with the earliest occurring between dorsal ribs and vertebrae. The robustness of forelimb elements is positively allometric with respect to their length, indicating weight-bearing relationship. Such length-dependent correlations are not seen in the hind limbs. Finally, incipient cervical half rings suggest a developmental pathway of outgrowths from the underlying band combined with fusion of overlying osteoderms. Â© 2015, The Paleontological Society.
