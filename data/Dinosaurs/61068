The studied deposits, mostly formed by carbonate sediments, belong to the Enciso Group (Depositional Sequence 7, upper Barremian–lower Aptian in age). The facies and facies associations of the Sol de la Pita (Préjano) stratigraphic section suggest the presence of a shallow, low-energy ramp carbonate lake. The footprints are mostly isolated and they have been produced by theropod, ornithopod, and sauropod dinosaurs. The latter group is only represented by an isolated manus impression whose morphology suggests that it was caused by an animal belonging to the clade Titanosauriformes. Despite its modest size and number of footprints, Sol de la Pita 1 is a very interesting example of the dinosaur ichno-diversity of these continental Cretaceous ecosystems from the Cameros Basin. © 2014, Instituto Geologico y Minero de Espana.
