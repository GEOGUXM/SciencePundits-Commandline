The eggshell oospecies from India and Argentina are compared and reviewed in detail. These eggshells resemble each other in having a nodular outer surface ornamentation and clearly arched growth lines of the shell units. Microstructurally, the eggshell oospecies belonging to the oofamily Megaloolithidae shows fan-like shell units, which are sharply separated from each other throughout the thickness of the eggshell and can be traced up to the surface of the eggshell. Comparisons between four oospecies from India and Argentina reveal three groupings, which show similarities between megaloolithids of both countries: (1) Megaloolithus jabalpurensis, M. matleyi and M. patagonicus; (2) M. cylindricus, M. rahioliensis and Tipo 1d; and (3) M.megadermus and Tipo 1e. The other two types of eggshell oospecies from India and Argentina show partially fused external nodes and shell units. As a result, growth lines enter into the adjacent shell units with a marked concavity. A new oogenus Fusioolithus have been erected due to fusion between shell units and tubospherulitic morphotype, which include two new oospecies F. baghensis and F. berthei. Till date, morphostructurally, a total of 15 eggshell oospecies belonging to different oofamilies have been recorded from India and seven oospecies from Argentina. © 2015, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.
