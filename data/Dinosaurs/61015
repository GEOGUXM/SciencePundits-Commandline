A reexamination of large caenagnathid material from the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, Canada, reveals undescribed material referable to Caenagnathus collinsi. A femur, two astragalocalcanei, two metatarsals, two unguals, and a caudal vertebra provide anatomical information on Caenagnathus collinsi. Estimates of femoral length based on the proportions of other oviraptorids suggest that the non-femoral material represents a taxon intermediate in size between Chirostenotes pergracilis from the Dinosaur Park Formation and Anzu wyliei from the Maastrichtian Hell Creek Formation. The femur is within the range of predictions, and confirms the body size estimates based on the other material. The large size of the material and a number of morphological characters distinguish the material from Chirostenotes pergracilis and suggest that it is referable to Caenagnathus collinsi. The relative diversity of caenagnathids in the Dinosaur Park Formation is likely underestimated. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
