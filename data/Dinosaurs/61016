The oviraptorosaurian theropod Caenagnathasia martinsoni is the least common dinosaur taxon in the Late Cretaceous (Turonian) vertebrate assemblage from the Bissekty Formation of the Kyzylkum Desert, Uzbekistan. The dentaries show numerous caenagnathid synapomorphies, including a fused dentary symphysis bearing distinct vascular grooves and associated foramina on its lingual surface, a lingual triturating shelf on the dentary, and extensive pneumatization of the dentary. Cervical and dorsal vertebrae attributed to C.martinsoni show a structure typical for Caenagnathoidea, whereas a referred partial femur is relatively plesiomorphic in having a large, finger-like anterior (lesser) trochanter separated from the greater trochanter. A referred synsacrum has only four vertebrae but may represent an immature individual. Caenagnathasia martinsoni is closely related to the clade comprising the North American Campanian-Maastrichtian caenagnathids. Â© 2014 .
