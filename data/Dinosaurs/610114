Daohugou is an important locality of the Jurassic Yanliao Biota, where only two pterosaurs have been described so far (Jeholopterus and Pterorhynchus). Here we report a new genus and species, Daohugoupterus delicatusgen. et sp. nov. (IVPP V12537), from this region, consisting of a partial skeleton with soft tissue. The skull is laterally compressed, differing from Jeholopterus. The antorbital fenestra is larger than in Pterorhynchus. The upper temporal fenestra is unusually small. The short cervical vertebrae bearing cervical ribs indicate that it is a non-pterodactyloid flying reptile. The sternal plate is triangular, being much wider than long. The deltopectoral crest of humerus is positioned proximally and does not extend further down the shaft, a typical feature of basal pterosaurs. Daohugoupterus also differs from the wukongopterids and scaphognathids from the Tiaojishan Formation at Linglongta, regarded to be about the same age as the Daohugou Bed. The new specimen increases the Jurassic non-pterodactyloid pterosaur diversity of the Yanliao Biota and is the smallest pterosaur from Daohugou area so far. Â© 2014, Taylor & Francis.
