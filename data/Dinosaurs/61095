Drumheller, some 90 miles northeast of Calgary, Canada, looks like any one of a thousand western towns. Its quiet streets are lined with low–slung buildings and storefronts, a diner or two, a bank branch. A water tower rises over the scene, the town’s name painted on its barrel body in tall block letters. But it doesn’t take long to see what makes the place different. © 2015, Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. All rights reserved.
