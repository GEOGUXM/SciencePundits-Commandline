This paper focuses on the management of geological heritage and particularly on the anthropic activities that stress these geological sites. Anthropic threats to geoheritage arise from two main sources: public use and the anthropic vulnerability of a geosite. Threats from public use include mining, quarrying, infrastructure construction, conflicts with other territorial uses, and possible conflicts with other types of natural or cultural heritages. Anthropic vulnerability comprises threats raised from the scientific, educational, and recreational uses of the geosites, as well as collecting and vandalism. All of these threats are discussed through the study case of the paleontological sites in La Rioja (Spain) where significant Cretaceous dinosaur footprints occur. The categorization and analysis of several cases allow for the discussion and proposal of diverse management strategies. The solutions provided derive from a management philosophy based on two basic principles: prevention and monitoring. These two premises entail changes both in the conservation of geological heritage and in general environmental management. Â© 2015 The European Association for Conservation of the Geological Heritage
