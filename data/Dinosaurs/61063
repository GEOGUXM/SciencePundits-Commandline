Dinosaur and crocodylomorph tracks are reported from a new Middle Jurassic tracksite in Central Iran. Crocodylomorphs are represented by a single, well-preserved trackway referred to as Cro-codylopodus isp., whereas dinosaur tracks belong to two different types referred to as Wildeichnus isp. and cf. Anchisauripus. This is the first report of crocodilian tracks from the Middle East, and one of the few from Asia. Furthermore, the presence of Wildeichnus in the Middle Jurassic of Iran is interesting because this ichnogenus has previously been reported from localities of roughly the same age in North and South America, as well as Europe and Northern Africa, and may thus be of global significance. © 2015 Società Geologica Italiana, Roma.
