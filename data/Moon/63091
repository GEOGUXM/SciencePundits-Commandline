The paper offers solution to the problem of geostationary spacecraft navigation by navigation satellite signal measurements using nonlinear dynamic equations, which include perturbing factors such as non-sphericity of the gravitational field of the Earth, gravitational attraction of the Moon and the Sun, and direct solar radiation pressure. This solution uses the iterative Kalman filter based on UD-decomposition and is focused on the onboard implementation with limited computing resources. The estimates of current coordinates and velocity components obtained with the Kalman filter are taken into account when integrating nonlinear equations of a spacecraft motion up to the next solution time moment. With undetermined solar radiation pressure coefficient, the proposed solution proved efficient in terms of accuracy requirements for the spaceborne satellite navigation receiver. The tests were conducted using a GPS signal simulator and a receiver. Â© 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.
