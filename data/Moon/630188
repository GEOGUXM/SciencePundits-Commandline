We present the shear joint using half-moon-shaped bearing bolt as an effective fastener between high-strength steel members. Experimental studies were carried out to clarify the maximum strength of the bolted joint and the elastic stiffness of beam flange joint. Also, materially and geometrically non-linear finite element analyses were carried out to show the mechanical properties of the joint with half-moon shaped bearing bolts. This paper shows the concept and capabilities of presented bolts. Obtained result was summarized as follows. The shank of the half-moon-shaped bolt has enough ultimate strength: 0.9 times the shear strength of effective sectional area. Slip back phenomena, in which the diagonal cut face of the shank slips out of its normal position, doesn't occur during large shear forces on the bolts. The half moon bolts always penetrate the connected steel plate so as to fill up a hole. Hence, the present shear joint maintains constant stiffness during a large number of pulsating cyclic loadings.
