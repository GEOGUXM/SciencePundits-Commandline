Reflective practice is generally regarded as an important part of legal education, and the typological models of reflection created by the likes of Schon, Boud, Mezirow and Moon to develop and evaluate the reflective practitioner are becoming as instrumental in LLB curriculum design as the learning models of Bloom, Gibbs and Kolb. What is less clear is the most appropriate methodology for the assessment of reflection, and, in particular what constitutes good reflective writing in this context. By using the medium of reflective writing this piece will explore and evaluate the approach taken to the assessment of the reflective report component of the problem-based learning LLB at York Law School. Reflective practice is an important part of the design of the problem-based learning curriculum and is fully embedded in the learning and teaching at York Law School. It will be shown here that it is just as important to engage the marking team in the rationale and educational benefit of reflective practice as it is the students. Only with a clearly defined task, a structured assessment framework, and ongoing marker training and development, will reflective practice have a meaningful place as an assessed component of the LLB.
