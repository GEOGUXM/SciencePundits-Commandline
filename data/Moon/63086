With the assistance of a cyclic three-level artificial atom of a superconducting flux quantum circuit interacting with a two-mode superconducting transmission-line resonator, we study theoretically the degenerate microwave parametric down-conversion (PDC) in a circuit-QED system. By adiabatically eliminating the excited states of the three-level artificial atom, we obtain an effective microwave PDC Hamiltonian for the two resonator modes (i.e., the fundamental and second-harmonic modes). The corresponding PDC efficiency in our model can be much larger than that in the similar circuit-QED system based on a single two-level superconducting qubit [K. Moon and S. M. Girvin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 140504 (2005)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.95.140504]. Furthermore, we investigate the squeezing and bunching behavior of the fundamental resonator mode resulting from the coherent driving to the second-harmonic one. Â© 2015 American Physical Society.
