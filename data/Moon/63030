Thirty-three microsatellite markers were developed for the Asian moon scallop, Amusium pleuronectes, from an enriched library and characterized in 30 scallops from a wild population. Of those 33 markers, 30 were polymorphic with the number of alleles ranging from 2 to 23 per locus. The expected and observed heterozygosities ranged from 0.07 to 0.85 and from 0.18 to 0.960 respectively. Ten loci showed significant (P < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction) deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, probably because of the presence of null alleles. This is the first set of microsatellites developed for A. pleuronectes and these markers will promote the selfing rate studies and genetic resource conservation of this species. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
