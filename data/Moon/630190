Compared with the low earth orbit synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system, the moon-borne SAR is distinct from its unique imaging geometry, so the Doppler parameters estimation method is different from conventional pickaback and satellite-borne SAR. Precise jet propulsion laboratory (JPL) ephemeris was used to interpolate the position, velocity and acceleration of lunar barycenter as well as the libration in geocentric inertial coordinate system. Then the position, velocity and acceleration of an object at any selenographic coordinates were able to be acquired via the coordinate transformation. Based on this, two quadratic equation sets were put forward to calculate the beam direction at any off-nadir angle and squint angle, and to solve the modulus value of line of sight, then coordinating the footprint center. Simulation results show that the beam angle needs a continuous adjustment along the orbit to point the earth disk in moon-borne SAR case, and the antenna position displacement leads to a significant shift on the Doppler parameters.
