The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite has been successfully operating since its launch on October 28, 2011. Unlike its predecessor MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), VIIRS has no independent onboard calibrator to perform the on-orbit characterization of its spatial parameters such as the band-to-band registration (BBR), detector-to-detector registration (DDR), and modulation transfer function (MTF). The surface properties of the Moon have been demonstrated to be spectrally, radiometrically, and geometrically stable in the long term, making the Moon a suitable target for the on-orbit calibration of satelliteborne remote sensing instruments. The methodologies of spatial characterization using the Moon have been developed for MODIS and validated, through the comparison of their results to those calibrated by the onboard spatial calibrator of MODIS. In this paper, the methodologies are extended and improved for VIIRS applications. The BBR, DDR in both along-scan and along-track directions and the MTF in the along-track direction of VIIRS are calculated from the lunar observations scheduled on a nearly monthly basis. The trending results confirm that these parameters have been stable over time: the BBR offset is less than 0.05 pixels in both directions, well within the performance specification requirement of 0.1 pixels. The along-track MTF is approximately 0.6, well above the specification of 0.3, and is consistent with the prelaunch measurement. The limitation of the current methodologies and the possible future improvements are also discussed in this paper.
