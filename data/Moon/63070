The validation of in-orbit instrument performance requires both stability in calibration source and also calibration corrections to compensate for instrument changes. Unlike internal calibrations, the Moon offers an external source whose signal variance is predictable and nondegrading. This paper describes a method of validation using lunar observations scanning near full moon by the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Flight Model (FM)-1 and FM-2 aboard the Terra satellite, FM-3 and FM-4 aboard the Aqua satellite, and, as of 2012, FM-5 aboard Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership. Given the stability of the source, adjustments within the data set are based entirely on removing orbital effects. Lunar observations were found to require a consistent data set spanning at least two to three years in length to examine instrument stability due to the final step when lunar libration effects are addressed. Initial results show a 20% annual variability in the data set. Using this method, however, results show trends per data channel of 1.0% per decade or less for FM-1 through FM-4. Results for FM-5 are not included in this paper because a sufficient data record has not yet been collected.
