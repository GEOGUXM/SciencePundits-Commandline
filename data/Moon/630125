Based on data obtained from satellite in 2006–2009 in the PAMELA experiment, the Moon’s shadow was discovered in cosmic rays with energies above 400 GeV. The obtained results are based on using the method for determining the particle arrival direction in the position-sensitive calorimeter, which is part of the PAMELA magnetic spectrometer. The Moon’s shadow was found to be shifted to the east due to deviations of electrons in the Earth’s magnetic field, which are part of the sample of detected particles. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.
