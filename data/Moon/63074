In this work, the elliptic restricted three-body problem (in brief ERTBP) with oblate and triaxial primaries using the pulsating coordinates is treated. Mean motion of the system is derived. The locations of the triangular equilibrium points under the considered model are computed. New expressions for these locations as power series in the mass ratio parameter are obtained. These locations are plotted against the whole domain of the mass ratio for different combinations of perturbations. The equations of motion are linearized near the triangular equilibrium points. The linear stability of the triangular points is discussed. It is found that the stability regions depend on the eccentricity of the orbits, oblateness coefficient and the triaxial parameters of the primaries. It is observed that when e=0.25 the stability region is destroyed completely for the Earth-Moon like system. Â© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
