We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a center on a local center manifold for three six-parameter families of quadratic systems on R3. We also give a positive answer to the conjecture posed in Mahdi (2013) for a special class of systems, called the Moon-Rand systems in the particular case when λ=2 and f is a homogeneous cubic polynomial. We also solve the center problem for a natural generalization of the above mentioned Moon-Rand systems. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.
