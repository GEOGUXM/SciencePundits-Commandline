Harmonic spectral features of electromagnetic waves in the frequencies of several Hz around the Moon have been identified by Kaguya. The waves have steepened waveforms peculiarly in the compressional component. The fundamental waves have almost the same properties as narrowband whistler-mode waves with the frequencies near 1 Hz, which have been observed around the Moon. The waves are observed around the terminator region in the solar wind near the lunar magnetic anomalies at the altitudes under 120 km. We suggest that the harmonic spectra are a result of the nonlinear steepening of narrowband whistler-mode waves. Although the narrowband whistler-mode waves have been observed in the upstream region of many planetary bow shocks, such harmonics have rarely been observed there. Since the harmonics are more frequently observed at lower altitudes of the Moon, they are possibly caused by lunar intrinsic environments including lunar dusts and local structures of lunar magnetic anomalies.
