Lissajous trajectories about the collinear libration points are relevant on the space environment and deep space exploration, but have complex kinetic characteristics in the nature, thus their design and stationkeeping have always been focused in the deep space navigation and control field. This paper explores orbit design and maintenance technology of the Lissajous trajectories about the collinear Earth-Moon libration points under the real dynamical conditions. First, based on the restricted three body problem, the mathematic model of Lissajous orbit design and control with the real dynamical model was analyzed. The continue-circling method was presented for the Lissajous orbit design and control. Then the Lissajous trajectories about Earth-Moon collinear libration point was designed under the nature environment, and the third-body gravitation and the solar radiation pressure perturbations and their level were studied, and their impact on the Lissajous orbit stability was analyzed. Finally, based on the perturbation impact and stability analysis and orbit tracking and control frequency, this paper framed a stationkeeping strategy for the Lissajous orbit about the Earth-Moon collinear libration points. This paper can provide a reference for the future Lissajous orbit mission. Â© 2014 IEEE.
