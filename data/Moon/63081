In this paper, the design of science orbits for the observation of a celestial body has been carried out using polynomial equations. The effects related to the main zonal harmonics of the celestial body and the perturbation deriving from the presence of a third celestial body have been taken into account. The third body describes a circular and equatorial orbit with respect to the primary body and, for its disturbing potential, an expansion in Legendre polynomials up to the second order has been considered. These polynomial equations allow the determination of science orbits around Jupiter’s satellite Europa, where the third body gravitational attraction represents one of the main forces influencing the motion of an orbiting probe. Thus, the retrieved relationships have been applied to this moon and periodic sun-synchronous and multi-sun-synchronous orbits have been determined. Finally, numerical simulations have been carried out to validate the analytical results. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht
