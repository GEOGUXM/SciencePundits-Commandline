The fundamental components of the Earth’s rotation parameters play an important role in solving the problems of navigation and control of spacecraft motion. Mathematical models of the Earth’s pole motion and dUT1 mismatch of the UT1 and UTC time scales adequate to the observation and measurement data of the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service are considered. It is shown that the proposed models provide sufficient autonomy to form parameters of the Earth’s rotation onboard the spacecraft. It is necessary to account for these parameters in real time onboard the spacecraft to solve problems of navigational support. The graphs of the daily forecast errors of the GLONASS navigation satellite orbits that are caused by the pole displacement, are presented. A comparative analysis of the graphs shows that disturbances of navigation satellite orbits are comparable with the gravitational influence of the Moon and the Sun and disturbances caused by the anomalous part of the Earth’s gravitational field. It is found that a significant increase in forecast accuracy for satellite ephemerides is achieved taking into account of the Earth’s rotational and vibrational motion in equations of spacecraft motion. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.
