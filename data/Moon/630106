Based on numerous research and landing trends, blue swimming crab (Portunus pelagicus) in Indonesia are presently under considerable pressure, as the volume and sizes of catches are decreasing. However, the management strategy for blue swimming crab still lacks crucial information. For this reason, a study in relation to the dynamics of the catch landing characteristics of blue swimming crab is important. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to analyse the dynamic of blue swimming crab catches. The study was conducted in Pangkajene Kepulauan, South Sulawesi Indonesia one of the focal points for landing blue swimming crab in Indonesia. The catches, both in total weight and morphometrics were compared between the monsoon season (month) and the phases of the moon. The results of this study concluded that the greatest landings of crab catches in Pangkajene Kepulauan occurred in the dry season (June) during the new moon. A comparison of the morphometrics of gear also concluded a similar result, where the width, length and weight also achieved the highest value during the dry season (June). Â© 2015, BIOFLUX SRL.
