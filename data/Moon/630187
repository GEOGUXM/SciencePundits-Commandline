Numerical investigation of the Earth and Moon rotational motion dynamics is carried out at a long time intervals. In our previous studies (Pashkevich, 2013), (Pashkevich and Eroshkin, 2011) the high-precision Rigid Earth Rotation Series (designated RERS2013) and Moon Rotation Series (designated MRS2011) were constructed. RERS2013 are dynamically adequate to the JPL DE422/LE422 (Folkner, 2011) ephemeris over 2000 and 6000 years and include about 4113 periodical terms (without attempt to estimate new subdiurnal and diurnal periodical terms). MRS2011 are dynamically adequate to the JPL DE406/LE406 (Standish, 1998) ephemeris over 418, 2000 and 6000 years and include about 1520 periodical terms. In present research have been improved the Rigid Earth Rotation Series RERS2013 and Moon Rotation Series MRS2011, and as a result have been constructed the new high-precision Rigid Earth Rotation Series RERS2014 and Moon Rotation Series MRS2014 dynamically adequate to the JPL DE422/LE422 ephemeris over 2000 and 6000 years, respectively. The elaboration of RERS2013 is carried out by means recalculation of sub-diurnal and diurnal periodical terms. The residuals in Euler angles between the numerical solution and RERS2014 do not surpass 3 ìas over 2000 years. Improve the accuracy of the series MRS2011 is obtained by using the JPL DE422/LE422 ephemeris. The residuals in the perturbing terms of the physical librations between the numerical solution and MRS2014 do not surpass 8 arc seconds over 6000 years. © 2015 Artificial Satellites.
