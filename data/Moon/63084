Background: OA is a complex disease caused by environmental and genetic risk factors. The purpose of this study is to identify candidate copy number variations (CNVs) associated with OA. Methods: We performed a genome-wide association study of CNV to identify potential loci that confer susceptibility to or protection from OA. CNV genotyping was conducted using NimbleGen HD2 3 x 720K comparative hybridization array and included samples from 371 OA patients and 467 healthy controls. The putative CNV regions identified were confirmed with a TaqMan assay. Results: We identified six genomic regions associated with OA encompassing CNV loci. None of six loci had previously been reported in genome-wide association studies with OA, although a genetic analysis suggested that they have functional effects. The protein product of a candidate risk gene for obesity, TNKS, targets Wnt inhibition, and this gene was significantly associated with hand and knee OA. Copy number deletion on TNKS was associated with a 1.37-fold decreased risk for OA. In addition, CA10, which shows a strong association with osteoporosis, was also significant in our study. Copy number deletion on this gene was associated with a 1.69-fold decreased risk for OA. Conclusion: We identified several CNV loci that may contribute to OA susceptibility in Koreans. Further functional investigations of these genes are warranted to fully characterize their putative association. Â© 2015 Moon et al.; licensee BioMed Central.
