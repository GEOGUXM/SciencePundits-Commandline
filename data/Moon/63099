Parametric array (PA) loudspeakers generate directional audible sound via the PA effect, which can make private listening possible. The practical applications of PA loudspeakers include information technology devices that require large power efficiency transducers with a wide frequency bandwidth. Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (PMUTs) are compact and efficient units for PA sources [Je, Lee, and Moon, Ultrasonics 53, 1124-1134 (2013)]. This study investigated the use of an array of PMUTs to make a PA loudspeaker with high power efficiency and wide bandwidth. The achievable maximum radiation bandwidth of the driver was calculated, and an array of PMUTs with two distinct resonance frequencies (f<inf>1</inf> = 100 kHz, f<inf>2</inf> = 110 kHz) was designed. Out-of-phase driving was used with the dual-resonance transducer array to increase the bandwidth. The fabricated PMUT array exhibited an efficiency of up to 71%, together with a ±3-dB bandwidth of 17 kHz for directly radiated primary waves, and 19.5 kHz (500 Hz to 20 kHz) for the difference frequency waves (with equalization). © 2015 Acoustical Society of America.
