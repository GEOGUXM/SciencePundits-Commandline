This article aims to report successful live births after transfer of fresh blastocyst or vitrified/warmed blastocyst derived from intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) on day-1 of unfertilized mature eggs (so-called "rescue ICSI") with spindle examination using polarized light microscopy. Two couples who had rescue ICSI performed achieved a positive pregnancy result after the transfer of a fresh or vitrified blastocyst. The two pregnancies led to the live births of a healthy baby boy of 2.72 kg and baby girl of 3.4 kg, respectively. Â© 2015 Moon et al.; licensee BioMed Central.
