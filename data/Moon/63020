Reiner Gamma is a sinuous feature in Oceanus Procellarum; it has a higher reflectance of the visible wavelength than the surrounding flat mare basalt, and displays a high crustal magnetic field. Previous studies relating to the origin of Reiner Gamma have provided contradictory depths of magnetic source bodies in the lunar crust as either shallow or deep. If a shallow ejecta layer existed beneath the Reiner Gamma formation, a subsurface lithological boundary between the denser mare basalt and the less dense ejecta blanket would be expected. This study examines subsurface stratifications using the Lunar Radar Sounder (LRS) onboard the Kaguya spacecraft. Taking into account the LRS-determined dielectric constants, the influence of surface clutter, and the energy loss of the LRS radar pulses in the high frequency band (5. MHz), no evidence was found of subsurface boundaries down to a depth of 1000-m at Reiner Gamma. Given the LRS range resolution of 75-m, the source of the magnetic anomaly is considered to be either strongly magnetized thin breccia layers at depths shallower than 75-m, or less magnetized thick layers at depths deeper than 1000-m.
