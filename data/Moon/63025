Active and passive seismic data from the Apollo 14 and 16 missions are analyzed with the aim of determining robust shear-wave velocity (V<inf>S</inf>) profiles of the uppermost lunar strata.While data from the Active Seismic Experiment (ASE) allow the study of Rayleigh-wave dispersion by means of Multiple Filter Analysis (MFA), data acquired by the Passive Seismic Experiment (PSE) are used to determine the Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio (HVSR). These two datasets are jointly analyzed according to state-of-the-art procedures in order to overcome the intrinsic limitations of both methodologies (when considered independently) and with the aim of determining a solution (i.e., the vertical V<inf>S</inf> profile) not affected by non-uniqueness of the solution and not based on any a priori assumption.Obtained results appear in general agreement with the early P-wave refraction analyses (a sharp contact between a very soft Regolith and a stiffer overlain layer is apparent) and indicate very low shear-wave velocities and very high Q values (low dissipation) also confirmed by a number of seismological studies on moonquakes and meteoroid impacts.
