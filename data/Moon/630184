A moon-shaped printed monopole antenna with modified ground plane is proposed for broadband circularly polarized (CP) radiation. Proposed monopole antenna consists of a moon-shaped radiator with a microstrip feed line. The moon-shaped radiator and its ground-plane shaped are optimized for broadband CP radiation. Impedance matching is improved using the quarter-wave transformer along with microstrip line. The measured results of the prototype antenna on FR4 substrate are 1.67 GHz (2.08-3.75 GHz) for 2.5-VSWR bandwidth, 1.48 GHz (2.28-3.76 GHz) for 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth, and gain around 1.6 dBic across the 3-dB AR bandwidth. Overall antenna volume is 0.466λ0 × 0.70λ0 × 0.008λ0 at 3.0 GHz. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microwave Opt Technol Lett 57:1135-1139, 2015 © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
