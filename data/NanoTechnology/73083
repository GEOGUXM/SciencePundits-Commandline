In last decades, nano technology developed. Since, nano scale thermal cycles will be possibly used in near future. In this study, a nano scale irreversible dual cycle was analyzed thermodynamically. Ideal Maxwell-Boltzmann gas is used for working fluid in the system. He4 is chosen as working fluid. Results are obtained as numerically. In calculations, different thermodynamic performance evaluation methods are applied and these methods are compared each other to determine the most convenient optimization way. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
