In the last decades, nano-technology has been developed very fast. According to this, nano-cycle thermodynamics should improve with a similar rate. In this paper, a nano-scale irreversible Brayton cycle working with helium is evaluated for different thermodynamic criteria. These are maximum work output, ecological function, ecological coefficient of performance, exergetic performance criteria and energy efficiency. Thermodynamic analysis was performed for these criteria and results were submitted numerically. In addition, these criteria are compared with each other and the most convenient methods for the optimum conditions are suggested. © 2015, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
