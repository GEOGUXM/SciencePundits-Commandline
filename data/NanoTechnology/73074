In this research, solar cells sensitized with CdS and PbS Nanocrystalline metal sulfides, chemically grown by SILAR, were fabricated and characterized. PV experiments including I-V test in the presence of light and dark,Vocdecay, and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were performed on the Cells made through this method in the presence of light and dark and in the time period of 2, 3, 6 and 10 days. From these experiments, the changes in indicators including fill factor, efficiency, open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, lifetime of electrons in nanostructured anode electrode, recombination resistance and capacitance of the anode electrode-electrolyte interface were observed. Also, mechanisms for some existing evidences within photovoltaic experiments such as the increase and decrease of recombination resistance were proposed. Â© 2015, Isfahan University of Technology.
