Clean hydrogen energy technology is an alternative to a fossil fuel-based energy economy. Efficient and economical catalysts are necessary for large-scale hydrogen generation. We report MoP and MoP-graphite nanosheets prepared by ball milling commercial compounds as efficient electrocatalytic materials for hydrogen generation via the hydrogen reduction mechanism. The hydrogen generated through electrochemical catalysis was evaluated using gas chromatography. The effects of ball milling time and proportions of MoP-graphite nanosheets on electrocatalytic activity were investigated. The new nanomaterials were characterized using powder XRD, SEM and BET surface area measurements. The results suggest superior electrocatalytic performance with a balance of ball-milled MoP and graphite. A Tafel slope of 63 mV/dec was obtained for this new material. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
