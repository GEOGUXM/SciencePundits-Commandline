A technology of production of nonmetal nanopowders and nanocrystals with characteristic dimensions of about 10 nm in the presence of microwave radiation fields is developed. Specially designed in the National Research Nuclear University (NRNU) MEPhI experimental microwave setup with a power of 5 kW and an operating frequency of 2450 MHz was used as a radiation source. Hydroxides/oxyhydroxides Zr — Y, Dy — Zr, and Dy — Hf placed in a special crucible located in a resonator chamber were used as parent materials. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.
