The microstructures and mechanical properties of a novel bainitic bearing steel subjected to austenitizing at 950. °C for 40. min followed by low-temperature austempering at 200. °C for 2. h, 6. h, 12. h and 72. h were studied. Nano-bainite microstructure with bainitic ferrite plate thickness about 50±15. nm was obtained by austempering at 200. °C for 6. h, 12. h and 72. h. Besides nano-scaled bainitic ferrite plates, there were small amount of retained austenite and undissolved carbides in the microstructure. The volume fraction of retained austenite is 7.2% in the samples austempered at 200. °C for 72. h. The ultimate tensile strength of samples austempered at 200. °C for 72. h reaches 2373. MPa, which is superior to the sample austempered at 200. °C for 2. h, whose microstructure is almost full martensite. The weight loss values are 0.0100. g and 0.0273. g for samples austempered for 72. h and 2. h respectively and the wear resistance of the sample austempered for 72. h is about 1.7 times higher than that for 2. h. Because of the excellent strength and wear resistance of the low-temperature bainite, this low-temperature austempering could be a potential technology for manufacturing bearings. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
