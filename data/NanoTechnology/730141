The importance of look-ahead and flexible acceleration and deceleration (Acc/Dec) technology to high-precision and high-speed computer numerical control (CNC) technology was firstly discussed; the massive data computing and high-precision requirement problem in NC blocks’ trajectory planning was revealed. Motived by this, the flexible ACC/DEC and look-ahead trajectory planning method was systematically studied. A four-level trajectory planning strategy including position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk planning was addressed in detail. A corner speed control method suitable for any multi-axis was expounded, and a classification method in forward speed planning was researched to describe various speed profiles. On the above basis, a nanoscale trajectory planning method using the long blocks segmentation method was proposed. The overall effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by the simulation and machining of a group of identical impellers. © 2015 Springer-Verlag London
