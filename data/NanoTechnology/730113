SnS<inf>2</inf> nanoflakes were successfully synthesized via a simple hydrothermal process. The as-prepared SnS<inf>2</inf> samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared SnS<inf>2</inf> nanoflakes under visible light irradiation (λ>420 nm) were evaluated by the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB). The effect of hydrothermal temperatures on the photocatalytic efficiency of as-prepared SnS<inf>2</inf> nanoflakes was investigated. The experimental result showed that SnS<inf>2</inf> nanoflakes synthesized at the temprature of 160° had higher photocatalytic efficiency and good photocatalytic stability. © 2015, Wuhan University of Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
