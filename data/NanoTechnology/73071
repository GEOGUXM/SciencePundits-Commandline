Thermal diffusivity of Au nanofluid was measured by using a dual beam mode-mismatched thermal lens method. The samples were prepared in various sizes by utilizing the gamma radiation method. In the dual beam mode-mismatched thermal lens, a diode laser (532 nm) was used as an excitation beam and a He-Ne laser with the beam output at 632.8 nm was used as a probe beam. Thermal diffusivity of gold nano-fluid increased with the increasing particle sizes ranging from 12.4 to 33 nm. Â© 2015, Isfahan University of Technology. All rights reserved.
