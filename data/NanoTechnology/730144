Highly disperse crystals of many metals are active polyfunctional materials that are capable of performing a large number of various functions when interacting with a surrounding medium—in particular, to initiate simultaneously several processes of various natures and to control them in a certain order. This fact allows polyfunctional nanodimensional structures to be treated as “nanorobots” controlling multistage chemical technologies. We consider an ideal model system of this kind representing disperse nickel particles functioning in the course of the catalytic pyrolysis of hydrocarbons. The behavior and role of each function carrier species involved in this “technological process” on a nanoscale are analyzed. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.
