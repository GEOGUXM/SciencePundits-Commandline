Besides the fundamental competition between the top-down and bottom-up approaches in nanotechnology, there are some basic aspects for organizing structures and functions at the molecular level. The recent challenges to the development of nanotechnology are marked by a group of general requirements: selection of suited building units, overcoming the restrictions of planar technology, shrinking of nanofabrication facilities, sustainable production and management of life cycles, organization of autonomy and communication at the nano-level, and the optimization of power consumption and energy management. Looking at the natural principles in the construction, synthesis, and function of proteins helps in understanding the principal differences between the currently applied technologies and the characteristics of biomolecular mechanisms in cells. This view allows formulating seven basic rules to meet the general requirements for future developments in molecular nanotechnology. Â© 2015 by De Gruyter 2015.
