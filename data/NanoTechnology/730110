A significant amount of aluminum dross is available as a waste in foundry industries in Bangladesh. In this study, alumina was extracted from aluminum dross collected from two foundry industries situated in Dhamrai and Manikgang, near the capital city, Dhaka. Aluminum dross samples were found to approximately contain 75wt% Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> and 12wt% SiO<inf>2</inf>. An acid dissolution process was used to recover the alumina value from the dross. The effects of various parameters, e.g., temperature, acid concentration, and leaching time, on the extraction of alumina were studied to optimize the dissolution process. First, Al(OH)<inf>3</inf> was produced in the form of a gel. Calcination of the Al(OH)<inf>3</inf> gel at 1000°C, 1200°C, and 1400°C for 2 h produced γ-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, (α+γ)-Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, and α-alumina powder, respectively. Thermal characterization of the Al(OH)<inf>3</inf> gel was performed by thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The phases and crystallite size of the alumina were determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. The dimensions of the alumina were found to be on the nano level. The chemical compositions of the aluminum dross and alumina were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy. The microstructure and morphology of the alumina were studied with scanning electron microscopy. The purity of the alumina extracted in this study was found to be 99.0%. Thus, it is expected that the obtained alumina powders can be potentially utilized as biomaterials. © 2015, University of Science and Technology Beijing and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
