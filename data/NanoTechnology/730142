Complex structure, magnetometry and NMR investigation of nanostructural cobalt powders synthesized using electron-beam technology was carried out. The developed technology makes it possible to fabricate roentgen-amorphous nanosized cobalt powders containing highly anisotropic HCP phase which does not require additional passivation measures. Magnetometry and NMR data are in correspondence with the results of structure measurements. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
