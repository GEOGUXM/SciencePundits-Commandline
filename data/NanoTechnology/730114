Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) design for active resonance frequency tuning of plasmonics optical filter is proposed and discussed. The design is based on controlling the relative position between two stubs in a metal-insulator-metal plasmonics waveguide using NEMS technology. The analysis of the optical design as well as the mechanical design is performed. Finally, a reasonable fabrication process of the device is proposed. For the suggested mechanical design parameters, the optical resonance wavelength can be tuned from 1.45 to 1.65 μm using 7V<inf>DC</inf> actuation voltage. © 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.
