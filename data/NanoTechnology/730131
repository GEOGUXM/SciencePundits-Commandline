Optical activity is a common natural phenomenon, which occurs in individual molecules, biomolecules, biological species, crystalline solids, liquid crystals, and various nanosized objects, leading to numerous important applications in almost every field of modern science and technology. Because this activity can hardly be altered, creation of artificial active media with controllable optical properties is of paramount importance. Here, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, we theoretically demonstrate that optical activity can be inherent to many semiconductor nanowires, as it is induced by chiral dislocations naturally developing during their growth. By assembling such nanowires in two- or three-dimensional periodic lattices, one can create optically active quantum supercrystals whose activity can be varied in many ways owing to the size quantization of the nanowires' energy spectra. We believe that this research is of particular importance for the future development of semiconducting nanomaterials and their applications in nanotechnology, chemistry, biology, and medicine.
