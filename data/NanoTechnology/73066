Abstract We review in detail the physics and technology of the novel material LiFePO4, a potential cathode material for Li-ion batteries. In the present work, nano crystalline LiFePO4 film has been synthesized in both powder and thin film forms from a non-aqueous sol-gel synthesis route based on oxalates of Li and Fe (II). Ferrous oxalate has been synthesized indigenously using a ferrous sulphate based chemical reaction and characterized. Nano powders and thin films of LiFePO4 have been fabricated and coated on stainless steel substrates with the aim of device development in future. The material has been characterized extensively by XRD for crystal structure, FESEM for microstructure, EDS for elemental analysis and FTIR for the internal modes of phosphate ion. Fe3+ impurity characterization has been done by using ESR. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
