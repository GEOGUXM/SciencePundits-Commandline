Therapeutic options based on near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths have attracted attention owing to in vivo lowest-background interventions and the development of several nano-architectures with localized surface plasmon resonance. Because of their limited tissue penetration, the clinical use of NIR light-driven treatments is not widespread; this technology is inapplicable to infection sites in the deeper areas of internal tissues. In this study, we demonstrate a self-illuminative therapeutic cassette able to exert anticancer effects via a series of enzymatic, chemical, and optical cooperative cascade reactions. It consists of (1) NIR-illuminative nanocomplexes and (2) NIR-sensitive therapeutic cassettes, which demonstrate a 60% chemically-induced killing effect in a prostate cancer model without external NIR irradiation. This technology can also be actively exploited as an imaging agent due to adaptation of a self-illuminating nanocomplex. Consequently, these novel therapeutic cassettes, which work not only as a powerful internal NIR stimulant, but also as a biological imaging platform, provide a new rational design concept for biomedical use.
