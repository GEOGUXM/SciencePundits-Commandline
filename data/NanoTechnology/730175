This paper presents an original characterization method of trapping phenomena in gallium nitride high electron mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs). This method is based on the frequency dispersion of the output-admittance that is characterized by low-frequency S-parameter measurements. As microwave performances of GaN HEMTs are significantly affected by trapping effects, trap characterization is essential for this power technology. The proposed measurement setup and the trap characterization method allow us to determine the activation energy Ea and the capture cross-section σn of the identified traps. Three original characterizations are presented here to investigate the particular effects of bias, ageing, and light, respectively. These measurements are illustrated through different technologies such as AlGaN/GaN and InAlN/GaN HEMTs with non-intentionally doped or carbon doped GaN buffer layers. The extracted trap signatures are intended to provide an efficient feedback to the technology developments Copyright © Cambridge University Press and the European Microwave Association 2015
