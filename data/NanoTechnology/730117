The ‘windows’ or ‘doors’ on the surface of a closed hollow structure can enable the exchange of material and information between the interior and exterior of one hollow sphere or between two hollow spheres, and this information or material exchange can also be controlled through altering the window’ size. Thus, it is very interesting and important to achieve the fabrication and adjustment of the ‘windows’ or ‘doors’ on the surface of a closed hollow structure. In this paper, we propose a new method based on the temple-assisted deposition method to achieve the fabrication of hollow spheres with windows of accurate size and number. Through precisely controlling of deposition parameters (i.e., deposition angle and number), hollow spheres with windows of total size from 0% to 50% and number from 1 to 6 have been successfully achieved. A geometrical model has been developed for the morphology simulation and size calculation of the windows, and the simulation results meet well with the experiment. This model will greatly improve the convenience and efficiency of this temple-assisted deposition method. In addition, these hollow spheres with desired windows also can be dispersed into liquid or arranged regularly on any desired substrate. These advantages will maximize their applications in many fields, such as drug transport and nano-research container. © 2015, Xie et al.; licensee Springer.
