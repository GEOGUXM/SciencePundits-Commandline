The fascinating electronic and optoelectronic properties of free-standing graphene has led to the exploration of alternative two-dimensional materials that can be easily integrated with current generation of electronic technologies. In contrast to 2D oxide and dichalcogenides, elemental 2D analogues of graphene, which include monolayer silicon (silicene), are fast emerging as promising alternatives, with predictions of high degree of integration with existing technologies. This article reviews this emerging class of 2D elemental materials - silicene, germanene, stanene, and phosphorene - with emphasis on fundamental properties and synthesis techniques. The need for further investigations to establish controlled synthesis techniques and the viability of such elemental 2D materials is highlighted. Future prospects harnessing the ability to manipulate the electronic structure of these materials for nano-and opto-electronic applications are identified. Â© 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &Co.
