The UV-SCIL fabrication process was developed and optimized to improve the quality of the nanostructures on the hard substrate transferred with substrate conformal imprint lithography (SCIL) technology. In particular, the key steps such as coating imprint resist, exposure time and etching time were investigated thoroughly. The experiment's results illustrate that imprint resist could well serve as an etching mask for the dry etching process without oxygen plasma. The optimized etching condition and SCIL technology could also be used to transfer nanostructures on different substrates for metal nanostructured biosensors or nanophotonics. Â© 2014 Author(s).
