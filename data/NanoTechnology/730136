Searching for novel hybrid electrocatalysts with high activity and strong durability for a direct electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is extremely desirable but still remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a novel solid carbon cloth-supported hybrid nano-bio electrocatalyst, decorated with Ag nanoparticles and proton-pumping bacteriorhodopsin (bR) (Ag/bR/CP) that were prepared by in situ electroless deposition and vesicle fusion technology, respectively. When applied as a hydrogen evolution cathode, the Ag/bR/CP shows a low onset overpotential of 63 mV, good durability (no detectable change in its catalytic activity for up to 1000 cycles in alkaline media), and enhanced HER performance under 550 nm irradiation, attributed to the activation of Ag and synergistic effects following light absorption, demonstrated by photoelectrochemical measurements.
