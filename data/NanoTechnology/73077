The gyrotropic rotation around the equilibrium position constitutes the fundamental excitation of magnetic vortices in nanostructures. The frequency of this mode varies with material and sample geometry, but is independent of the vortex handedness and its core direction. Here, we demonstrate that this degeneracy is lifted in a spin-torque oscillator containing two vortices stacked on top of each other. When driven by spin-polarized currents, such devices exhibit a set of dynamic modes with discretely split frequencies, each corresponding to a specific combination of vorticities and relative core polarities. The fine splitting occurs even in the absence of external fields, demonstrating that such devices can function as zero-field, multi-channel, nano-oscillators for communication technologies. It also facilitates the detection of the relative core polarization and allows for the eight non-degenerate configurations to be distinguished electrically, which may enable the design of multi-state memory devices based on double-vortex nanopillars.
