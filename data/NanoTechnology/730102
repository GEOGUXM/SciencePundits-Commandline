In this study, nano-sized WO3powder was dispersed into Co4Sb11.-7Te0 .-3thermoelectric matrix by ball milling and hot-press sintering technology. The results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the WO3phase distributed uniformly in the form of inclusions on the matrix. Highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) presented that the average size of embedded nano-WO3was about 50 nm. With the content of WO3increasing, the electrical conductivity (σ ) of Co 4Sb11.-7Te0. -3decreased and the absolute value of Seebeck coefficient (α) increased. The absolute value of α for 1.5%WO3/Co4Sb 11 .-7Te0-.3composite was 258 μV/K at 650 K. The minimal lattice thermal conductivity (κ L) of WO3 /Co4Sb11-.7Te0 .-3achieved in the present work was 1.52 W/m K at 650 K. The total thermal conductivity (κ ) of WO3/ Co 4Sb11.-7Te0. -3composites decreased obviously, which resulted from the phonon scattering by the WO3 inclusions locating on the grain boundaries of Co4Sb 11 .-7Te0-.3matrix. The highest ZT of 0.71 was achieved at 750 K for 1.5%WO3/Co4Sb 11. -7&lt;.inf&gt; Te0.-3composite. Copyright © 2015 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.
