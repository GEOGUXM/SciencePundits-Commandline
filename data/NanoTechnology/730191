In this chapter we explore algorithms and develop architectures based on emerging nano-device technologies for cognitive computing tasks such as recognition, classification, and vision. In particular we focus on pattern matching in high dimensional vector spaces to address the nearest neighbor search problem. Recent progress in nanotechnology provides us novel nano-devices with special nonlinear response characteristics that fit cognitive tasks better than general purpose computing. We build an associative memory (AM) by weakly coupling nano-oscillators as an oscillatory neural network and design a hierarchical tree structure to organize groups of AM units. The tree structure design is driven by the realization that the physical domain of an ensemble of oscillators is limited by noise, scattering effects, or interconnect density. Therefore, the problem has to be segmented into a hierarchal tree structure. However, hierarchical memories have not been successful previously. In our work, the tree structure model is developed as a scalable AM architecture for large data sets where patterns are classified by hierarchical k-means clustering and organized in hierarchical clusters. Then the recognition process is done by comparison between the input patterns and centroids identified in the clustering process. The tree is explored in a "depth-only" manner until the closest image pattern is output. We also extend this search technique to incorporate a branch-and-bound algorithm. The branch and bound search increases time by only a factor of two compared to a depth-only search. Â© 2015 John Wiley and Sons Ltd.
