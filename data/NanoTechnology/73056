Component miniaturization is increasingly gaining importance in numerous microsystem technologies, including medical technology, biotechnology, and drive technology. In this study, two types of nano-sized powder, namely, metal (stainless steel 316L) and ceramic (yttria-stabilized zirconia), were used to fabricate miniature parts through micro powder injection molding. Micro parts were produced by mixing powders with a binder system, followed by injection, debinding, and sintering process. Partially water-soluble binder system with surfactant addition was used to mix with either stainless steel 316L or yttria-stabilized zirconia nanopowder to form feedstock to avoid the agglomeration of fine powder and environmentally hazardous organic binder. The polyethylene glycol loss in water was observed after a rapid removal period in the first 60 min of immersion for the micro parts. Approximately 99 % of the polymethyl methacrylate binder was removed after pyrolysis at 450 °C for 2.5 h. Sintered ceramic and metallic parts showed a relative density that is approximately 97 % of theoretical density and free of defects. Hardness of approximately 221 and 1,200 Hv was achieved for the fabricated micro parts using stainless steel 316L and yttria-stabilized zirconia powders, respectively. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
