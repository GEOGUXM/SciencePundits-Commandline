Recently, scientific communities in electrical engineering, material science, biophysics and nano-technologies have paid special attention to memristor devices. Several physical and mathematical memristor models have been proposed to describe devices developed for nonvolatile memory applications and neuromorphic systems. The aim of the paper is to provide a theoretical approach to the various classes of memristive devices as nonlinear dynamical systems whose voltage-current curves (i.e., dynamic characteristics) are pinched at the origin when driven by bipolar excitations. Off-origin dynamic characteristics are discussed and mathematical criteria to model such devices are provided as well. Finally, passivity and losslessness properties of memristor are briefly analized.
