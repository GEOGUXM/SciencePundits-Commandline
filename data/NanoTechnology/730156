The effect of dopant concentration on the morphology of ZnO nanostructures was investigated. This study demonstrated morphological changes in ZnO nanostructures from spherical to flower-shaped on increasing dopant concentration. The structural and morphological changes in europium doped ZnO nanostructures are validated by SEM and TEM results, clearly indicating the formation of hierarchical ZnO nanoflowers as the dopant concentration is increased to 5%. The phenomenal morphological and optical emission characteristic of europium doped ZnO nanoflowers may serve as a potential material in materials science and other fields of technology.
