Materials science is recognized as one of the main factors driving development and economic growth. Since the silicon industrial revolution of the 1950s, research and developments in materials and solid state science have radically impacted and transformed our society by enabling the emergence of the computer technologies, wireless communications, Internet, digital data storage, and widespread consumer electronics. Today's emergent topics in solid state physics, such as nano-materials, graphene and carbon nano-tubes, smart and advanced functional materials, spintronic materials, bio-materials, and multiferroic materials, promise to deliver a new wave of technological advances and economic impact, comparable to the silicon industrial revolution of the 1950s.The surge of interest in multiferroic materials over the past 15 years has been driven by their fascinating physical properties and huge potential for technological applications. This article addresses some of the fundamental aspects of solid-state multiferroic materials, followed by the detailed presentation of the latest and most interesting proposed applications of these multifunctional solid-state compounds. The applications presented here are critically discussed in the context of the state-of-the-art and current scientific challenges. They are highly interdisciplinary covering a wide range of topics and technologies including sensors, microwave devices, energy harvesting, photo-voltaic technologies, solid-state refrigeration, data storage recording technologies, and random access multi-state memories. According to their potential and expected impact, it is estimated that multiferroic technologies could soon reach multibillion US dollar market value. 2014 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC
