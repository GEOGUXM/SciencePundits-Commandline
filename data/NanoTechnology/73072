Reflection spectra of four porous silicon samples under etching times of 2, 6, 10, and 14 min with current density of 10 mA/cm2 were measured. Reflection spectra behaviors for all samples were the same, but their intensities were different and decreased by increasing the etching time. The similar behavior of reflection spectra could be attributed to the electrolyte solution concentration which was the same during fabrication and reduction of reflection spectrum due to the reduction of particle size. Also, the region for the lowest intensity at reflection spectra was related to porous silicon energy gap which shows blue shift for porous silicon energy gap. Roughness study of porous silicon samples was done by scattering spectra measurements, Rayleigh criteria, and Davis-Bennet equation. Scattering spectra of the samples were measured at 10, 15, and 20 degrees by using spectrophotometer. Reflected light intensity reduced by increasing the scattering angle except for the normal scattering which agreed with Rayleigh criteria. Also, our results showed that by increasing the etching time, porosity (sizes and numbers of pores) increases and therefore light absorption increases and scattering from surface reduces. But since scattering varies with the observation scale (wavelength), the relationship between scattering and porosity differs by varying the observation scale (wavelength).
