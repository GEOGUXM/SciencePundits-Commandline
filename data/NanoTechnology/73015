In this work we demonstrate that Reverse Nanoimprint Lithography is a feasible and flexible lithography technique applicable to the transfer of micro and nano polymer structures with no residual layer over areas of cm2 areas on silicon, metal and non-planar substrates. We used a flexible polydimethylsiloxane stamp with hydrophobic features. We present residual layer-free patterns imprinted using a commercial poly(methylmethacrylate) thermoplastic polymer over silicon, nickel and pre-patterned substrates. Our versatile patterning technology is adaptable to free form nano structuring and has coupling to adhesion technologies. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
