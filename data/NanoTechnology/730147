The deficiency of existing electrical contact materials is currently a significant impediment to the commercialization of nanoelectromechanical (NEM) contact switches?a low-power ?beyond complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology? [1]. NEM switches using traditional metallic electrical contact materials, even those composed of inert, noble metals such as gold (Au) and platinum (Pt), demonstrate premature failure due to either their adhesiveness or catalytic activity, leading to a buildup of insulating interfacial contaminants. Commercially viable NEM switches demand novel contact materials along with efficient methods to evaluate the performance of these materials. Â© 2007-2011 IEEE.
