Objectives: As a haloalkaliphilic, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, Thialkalivibrio versutus D301 can remove sulfide, thiosulfate and polysulfide in wastewater, we investigated how it might be reused when mixed with high concentrations of elemental sulfur. Results: A process is described to immobilize T. versutus cells by using superparamagnetic Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> nanoparticles (NPs) under haloalkaliphilic conditions (i.e. pH 9.5, 0.5 M Na+). The saturation magnetization value (δ<inf>s</inf>) of immobilized cells was 55.1 emu/g. The Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> NPs-coated cells had the similar sulfur oxidization activity to that of free cells, and they could be reused six batch cycles. Analysis of hydraulic diameters showed that bacterial cells were immobilized by Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> NPs due to the nano-size effects. Conclusions: Magnetic immobilization is a convenient technique for cell immobilization under haloalkaliphilic conditions and is a promising technology for large scale application. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht
