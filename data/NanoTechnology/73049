Icing of surfaces is commonplace in nature and technology, affecting everyday life and sometimes causing catastrophic events. Understanding (and counteracting) surface icing brings with it significant scientific challenges that requires interdisciplinary knowledge from diverse scientific fields such as nucleation thermodynamics and heat transfer, fluid dynamics, surface chemistry, and surface nanoengineering. Here we discuss key aspects and findings related to the physics of ice formation on surfaces and show how such knowledge could be employed to rationally develop surfaces with extreme resistance to icing (extraordinary icephobicity). Although superhydrophobic surfaces with micro-, nano-, or (often biomimetic) hierarchical roughnesses have shown in laboratory settings (under certain conditions) excellent repellency and low adhesion to water down to temperatures near or below the freezing point, extreme icephobicity necessitates additional important functionalities. Other approaches, such as lubricant-impregnated surfaces, exhibit both advantages and serious limitations with respect to icing. In all, a clear path toward passive surfaces with extreme resistance to ice formation remains a challenge, but it is one well worth undertaking. Equally important to potential applications is scalable surface manufacturing and the ability of icephobic surfaces to perform reliably and sustainably outside the laboratory under adverse conditions. Surfaces should possess mechanical and chemical stability, and they should be thermally resilient. Such issues and related research directions are also addressed in this article.
