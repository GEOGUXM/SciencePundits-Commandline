In this paper, we present recent progress of our researches on positioning of quantum dot in the field of optoelectronics. The first research is aimed at quantum information device application. As a technology for production of quantum devices, we developed the method for positioning of a single colloidal quantum dot. Oxide lines on a Si substrate drawn by a scanning probe microscope were used as a negative etching mask with controlling their cross section in order to create a nanohole for trapping of a single quantum dot. The other research is aimed at solar cell application. It has been predicted that quantum-dot superlattice solar cell will achieve photoelectric conversion efficiency of more than 70%. After the sedimentation of the colloidal quantum dots into the pyramidal holes processed by anisotropic wet etching on a Si substrate, we observed characteristic photoluminescence from the quantum-dot sheet.
