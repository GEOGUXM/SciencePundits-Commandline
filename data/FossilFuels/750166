Technology advancement and population pressures demand that development planning be conducted not only with the techno-economic paradigm in mind but also taking into consideration environmental, political, and social sustainability factors. Projections considering current energy policies demonstrate that global electricity consumption will grow by 84% in the next 25 years. The portion of electricity consumption from fossil fuels is estimated at 63%, still representing a major ?challenge to the energy sector in the coming decades [1]. Estimating supply alternatives for increasing electricity consumption is integral to the development expansion plans of developing nations. The selected countries in this work are part of different social, environmental, political, and economic scenarios. Although the sample of countries is small, it represents a very heterogeneous and comprehensive group. The implications from the review here aim to provide an overview of energy planning around the world. Â© 2015 IEEE.
