Due to the operation in mixed and boundary friction, minimization of friction losses in automobile powertrains offers high potential for lowering of greenhouse gas emissions and saving fossil fuels. In cooperation between Surface Engineering Institute (IOT) and Gear Research Center (FZG), surface modifications in terms of stochastic and deterministic structures, diamond-like carbon (DLC) and nitride hard physical vapor deposition (PVD) coatings were tested in lubricated rolling-sliding contacts in twin-disk and gear efficiency test-rig. It was found that deterministic structured surfaces provide for reduction of friction losses by up to 7% under extreme boundary friction conditions at high Hertzian stresses and small relative lubricant film thicknesses. Application-oriented tests using DLC coated gear wheels in gear efficiency test-rig exhibited a reduction of friction losses between 10% and 21% compared to uncoated gear wheels. The DLC coating ZrCg developed at IOT provided for friction reduction of 15% for small circumferential speeds in boundary friction. Friction losses were reduced by up to 39% at higher circumferential speeds in spite of fully separated surfaces in the fluid friction regime. Due to their thermophysical properties, it is assumed that DLC coatings have an impact on viscosity and shear resistance of the lubricant. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
