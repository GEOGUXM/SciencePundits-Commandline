The current fossil fuel-based generation of energy has led to large-scale industrial development. However, the reliance on fossil fuels leads to the significant depletion of natural resources of buried combustible geologic deposits and to negative effects on the global climate with emissions of greenhouse gases. Accordingly, enormous efforts are directed to transition from fossil fuels to nonpolluting and renewable energy sources. One potential alternative is biohydrogen (H<inf>2</inf>), a clean energy carrier with high-energy yields; upon the combustion of H<inf>2</inf>, H<inf>2</inf>O is the only major by-product. In recent decades, the attractive and renewable characteristics of H<inf>2</inf> led us to develop a variety of biological routes for the production of H<inf>2</inf>. Based on the mode of H<inf>2</inf> generation, the biological routes for H<inf>2</inf> production are categorized into four groups: photobiological fermentation, anaerobic fermentation, enzymatic and microbial electrolysis, and a combination of these processes. Thus, this review primarily focuses on the evaluation of the biological routes for the production of H<inf>2</inf>. In particular, we assess the efficiency and feasibility of these bioprocesses with respect to the factors that affect operations, and we delineate the limitations. Additionally, alternative options such as bioaugmentation, multiple process integration, and microbial electrolysis to improve process efficiency are discussed to address industrial-level applications.
