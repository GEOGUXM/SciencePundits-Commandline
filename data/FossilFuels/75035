In order to mitigate the environmental pollution and reduce the dependency on the fossil fuel, the biodiesel has been suggested as an alternative fuel in the newly developed diesel engines. Since the surface tension is an important factor for proper atomization and combustion of biodiesels, an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is developed for accurate prediction of the surface tensions of different biodiesels in this work. Comparison of the suggested model with the most important existing models shows that the presented computational framework outperforms the other alternatives both in accuracy and generality. The overall predicted surface tensions regarding ten different biodiesels are in excellent agreement with experimental data with the AAD of 0.43% and R2-value of 0.9865. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
