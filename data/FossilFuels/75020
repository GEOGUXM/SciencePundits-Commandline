The present global energy scenario, in which fossil fuels play a preponderant role, faces significant energy and environmental challenges. To help address these challenges, countries across the world are increasing the contribution made by renewable energy (RE) resources to their energy supplies. Feed-in Tariff (FiT) is one of the most effective incentive policies used to promote the RE sector especially at the micro-generation level. The key objective of the FiT schemes is to provide financial support to residential, industrial and commercial consumers to encourage them to become RE producers. Solar photovoltaic (PV) is one of the most promising RE technologies. This paper provides an overview of the solar PV developments in the Association of South East Asian Nation (ASEAN) countries. It reflects upon the RE trends in the world as well as providing an introduction to the ASEAN countries. It reviews the progress of solar PV in each of the ASEAN countries especially in terms of RE policies, growth in terms of PV installations and research and development activities. Finally, the paper presents conclusions and a set of recommendations. Out of the 10 ASEAN countries, 5 have implemented FiT as a key policy incentive to stimulate the progress of RE. It is found that the ASEAN countries have great potential for solar PV in term of their annual solar insolation levels, which ranging from 1460 to 1892 kWh/m2 per year. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
