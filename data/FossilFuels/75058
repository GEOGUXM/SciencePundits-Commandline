The aim of the research was to determine fuel properties and burning characteristics of sour plum (Ximenia americana L.) seed oil compared with Jatropha curcas seed oil when unblended and blended with kerosene. Fossil oil fuel products have witnessed increased demand all over the world with prices reaching new peaks. Sour plum (Ximenia americana L.) seed oil as one potential biofuel was evaluated to determine its fuel properties as substitute for kerosene. The seed oil was blended with kerosene in varying ratios and the parameters: burning rate and flame height determined. The blended oil was also burned in modified kerosene stove. It was found that Density, viscosity, fire point, carbon residue and ash content influenced its burning parameters. Parameter burning characteristics and energy transfered improved with increasing blend of kerosene. In conclusion, Ximenia americana L. seed oil when blended with kerosene in ratio above 10% can supplement kerosene as biofuel. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
