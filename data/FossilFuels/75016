Utilising fossil fuel economically is of utmost importance in modern civilization as fossil fuel resources are apprehended to be exhausted by the turn of the century. Development of alternative fuels is expected to play a pivotal role during the forthcoming decades. These alternative fuels, in general, are free from green house gases, which are almost responsible for global warming among all other effects. Introduction of newer alternative fuels is surely to enhance the quality of life across the world. Use and reuse of alternative fuels to a greater extent for the benefit of our society is a great challenge as well as an opportunity for engineers. The present study aims at choosing one of the most suitable alternative fuels, which would perform well in relation to various attributes. The most appropriate fuel out of five alternatives has been chosen by using multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methodologies. Weightage of each criterion is determined by using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and ranks of the alternatives have been calculated by using MOORA and PROMETHEE methods. The alternative A<inf>4</inf>, which is Mahua blend is the most appropriate alternative fuel for this present study since it has been ranked first by both the MCDM methods. The performance of both the methods is judged by finding Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Therefore, MCDM methodologies can be utilised to select the best alternative fuel.
