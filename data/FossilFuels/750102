Hydrogen is an energy carrier that can transform our fossil fuel-dependent economy into a hydrogen economy, which can provide an emission-free transportation fuel. Hydrogen-fuelled engines are known for several advantages, among which is the very low concentration of pollutants in the exhaust gases compared with internal combustion engines using traditional or other alternative fuels. Hydrogen-driven vehicles thus reduce both local and global emissions. It is an energy carrier that can be used in internal combustion engines or fuel cells producing virtually no greenhouse gas emissions when combusted with oxygen. The only significant emission is water vapour. The effect of blending of hydrogen with gasoline is analysed in this current paper. Both HC and NO<inf>x</inf> concentration decrease with the increase in hydrogen fractions. The results were analysed by collecting data on different crank angles and at 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% of hydrogen introduction into combustion chamber along with gasoline as base fuel.
