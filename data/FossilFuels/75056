Abstract Environmental degradation and the diminishing reserves of fossil fuel are the major drives for the search for biodiesel as alternative fuel. Jatropha curcas oil has been well researched as non-edible vegetable oil for the production of biodiesel using conventional processes which generate huge obnoxious wastes and consequently incur additional cost for treatment and disposal of the generated waste. This paper presents the hydrolytic biosynthesis of J. curcas hydrolysate (FFA) for the production of biodiesel using locally produced Candida cylindracea lipase immobilized on functionalized activated carbon support. Up to 78% of free fatty acid (FFA) was achieved through hydrolytic reaction relative to the source and activity of the enzyme employed. Optimum dose of the catalyst loading was 8% (w/w) of the immobilized matrix at 40 °C reaction temperature and 200 rpm agitation. All reactions were allowed to proceed for 24 h, and catalyst could be recycled four times for optimal FFA yield. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.
