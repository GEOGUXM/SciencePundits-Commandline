The use of fossil fuels now induces two major issues. First, fossil fuel burning is increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) concentrations and, in turn, global warming. Second, fossil fuel resources are limited and will thus decrease in the long run. As a potential solution, there is a need for ecological manufacturing processes that convert raw plant materials into chemical products. For instance, raw plants can be directly converted into hydroxymethylfurfural, which is a versatile intermediate for the synthesis of valuable biofuels such as dimethylfuran and 5-ethoxymethyl-2-furfural. This technology has two benefits for chemical sustainability. First, the pretreatment step is eliminated, thus contributing to reduction of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. Second, plants are sustainable resources versus fossil fuels, which are limited. Here, we review current sustainable technologies for the production of biobased products and hydroxymethylfurfural from plants, using in particular ionic liquids. Plant sources include poplar, switchgrass, miscanthus, weed plants, and agave species. Â© 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland
