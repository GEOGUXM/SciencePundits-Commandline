China has very ambitious goals of expanding its commercial nuclear power by 30 GW within the decade and wishes to phase out fossil fuels emissions by 40-45% by 2020 (from 2005 levels). With over 50 new nuclear power plants under construction or planned and a design life of 60 years, any discussions on structural integrity become very timely. Although China adopted its nuclear technology from France or USA at present time, e.g., AP1000 of Westinghouse, the construction materials are primarily "Made in China." Among all issues, both the accumulation of the knowledge base of the materials and structures used for the power plant and the technical capability of engineering personnel are imminent. This paper attempts to compile and assess the mechanical properties, Charpy V-notch impact energy, and fracture toughness of A508-3 steel used in Chinese nuclear reactor pressure vessels (RPVs). All data are collected from open literature and by no means complete. However, it provides a glimpse into how this domestically produced steel compares with western RPV steels such as USA A533B and Euro 20MnMoNi55. Copyright Â© 2015 by ASME.
