For CO2 capture and storage deployment, the impact of impurities in the gas or dense phase CO2 stream arising from fossil fuel power plants, or large scale industrial emitters, is of fundamental importance to the safe and economic transportation and storage of the captured CO2. This paper reviews the range and level of impurities expected from the main capture technologies used with fossil-fuelled power plants in addition to other CO2 emission-intensive industries. Analysis is presented with respect to the range of impurities present in CO2 streams captured using pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxy-fuel technologies, in addition to an assessment of the different parameters affecting the CO2 mixture composition. This includes modes of operation of the power plant, and different technologies for the reduction and removal of problematic components such as water and acid gases (SOx/NOx). A literature review of data demonstrates that the purity of CO2 product gases from carbon capture sources is highly dependent upon the type of technology used. This paper also addresses the CO2 purification technologies available for the removal of CO2 impurities from raw oxy-fuel flue gas, such as Hg and non-condensable compounds. CO2 purities of over 99% are achievable using post-combustion capture technologies with low levels of the main impurities of N2, Ar and O2. However, CO2 capture from oxy-fuel combustion and integrated gasification combined cycle power plants will need to take into consideration the removal of non-condensables, acid gas species, and other contaminants. The actual level of CO2 purity required will be dictated by a combination of transport and storage requirements, and process economics. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
