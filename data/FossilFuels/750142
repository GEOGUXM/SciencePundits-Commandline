Currently, hydrogen is produced industrially by processes requiring high energy consumption, especially by cracking fossil fuels and by splitting water. In recent years, research has been devoted to the use of membrane catalytic reactors in order to achieve higher hydrogen yield. Zeolite membranes have been shown to be very promising as they are stable to contaminants (such as H2S) and do not have the disadvantages that palladium and silica membranes exhibit. The aim of this work is to summarize the state of the art of hydrogen selective zeolite membranes that can be applied for hydrogen separation after syngas production from reforming streams. In addition, zeolite membrane applications in membrane reactors for hydrogen production are discussed. Â© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
