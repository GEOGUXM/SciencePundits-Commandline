The depletion of fossil fuels and environmental pollution provide an increasing requirement for rechargeable batteries with high energy densities, high efficiency, and excellent cycling performance. Aqueous rechargeable batteries (ARBs), with the merits of safety, low-cost, super-fast charge-discharge ability, and environmental friendliness, are one of the most competitive technologies for large-scale energy systems. Recently, extensive efforts have been dedicated to enhancing their electrochemical performance, and great breakthroughs have been achieved, especially for aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries (ARLBs), including three generations of ARLBs, aqueous rechargeable sodium batteries (ARSBs), and redox flow batteries (RFBs). Herein, the latest advances on their critical components are reviewed, and challenges and further directions are also pointed out. Â© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
