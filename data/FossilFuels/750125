Dominance of fossil fuels in the transportation sector has led to environmental and economical problems and transition to Alternative Fuel Vehicle (AFV) has become a necessity. Electric Vehicle (EV) is one of the AFVs that deliver clear benefit of zero tailpipe emissions. The EVs have a limited range and their use is influenced by the location of recharging facilities. The charging time of EV is long and recharging in stations take a lot of time. In addition, the capacity of recharging stations is limited and if the capacity is occupied the vehicles must wait in queues. In this paper, a recharging station location model with queue is proposed which considers capacity, recharging time, and waiting time. The presented model is a set covering and can easily become a maximum cover model with or without predefined activities. A heuristic algorithm to solve the model is proposed and the model is evaluated using two networks under various conditions; a random generated and a network of Penghu County. The obtained results indicate that the model is able to identify the location and the number of the recharging stations and provide a good travel plan especially for tourism.
