Biomass-derived fuels constitute a promising alternative for diversifying the fuel supply and reducing the consumption of fossil fuels, leading to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and thus mitigating global warming. Biomass can be converted to synthesis gas, which can serve as a source for various liquid and gaseous fuels. Although significant progress has been achieved in the overall process, both economic and technical challenges still need to be overcome. Many pilot plants are already in operation and the first demonstration and semi-commercial installations are under construction or starting to operate. Catalysis is a key parameter in the conversion of synthesis gas to fuels. The aim of this work is to present the latest advances in the catalytic conversion of synthesis gas to Fischer-Tropsch gasoline and diesel, synthetic natural gas, ethanol and mixed alcohols. The syntheses of methanol and dimethyl ether are also briefly reviewed. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.
