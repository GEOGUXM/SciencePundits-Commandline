Paleoceanographic reconstructions rely on chemical proxies which are controlled by physical, chemical, and biological marine parameters. The accurate interpretation of proxy records relies on the integrity of proxy-environmental relationships through time, and under changing conditions. In this study we closely examine paleo controls on authigenic Nd isotope records from five cores in the northern NE Atlantic, approximating a depth-transect, allowing spatial and temporal relationships to be reconstructed. We compare our Nd isotope records with other paleocirculation proxies, and consider the sedimentalogical controls on Nd isotope signals, by comparing ice-rafted detritus lithology and counts, detrital sediment chemistry and redox sensitive element concentrations measured on foraminifera authigenic coatings. With this suite of geochemical and sedimentalogical data we show that Nd isotope records in the northern NE Atlantic were labeled by radiogenic sediments, however this modification did not occur in the pore-waters of each core, but instead likely reflects changes in the Nd isotopic composition of deep-waters caused by the input of ice-rafted sediment during Heinrich events and the last glacial maximum. This study has implications for understanding how localized changes in the Nd isotope signal can set a watermass end-member composition, decoupling chemical proxy-circulation relationships locally, but providing a signal which can be potentially traced along the deep-water flowpath. Such scenarios must be considered in future interpretations of glacial Nd isotope records taken from within the ice-rafted detritus belt and downstream along watermass flowpaths. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
