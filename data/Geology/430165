Over the last decade, terrestrial laser scanning and digital terrestrial photogrammetry techniques have been increasingly used in the geometrical characterization of rock slopes. These techniques provide innovative remote sensing tools which overcome the frequent problem of rock slope inaccessibility. Comprehensive datasets characterizing the structural geological setting and geometry of the slopes can be obtained. The derived information is very useful in rock slope investigations and finds application in a wide variety of geotechnical and mine operations. In this research an integrated remote sensing - GIS approach is proposed for the deterministic kinematic characterization of the Lorano open pit in the Apuan Alps of Italy. Based on the results of geomatic and engineering geological surveys, additional geomechanical analysis using a 3D finite difference method will be presented in order to provide a better understanding of the role of stress-induced damage on slope performance.
