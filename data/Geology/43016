In Eastern Transbaikalia the gold-bismuth mineralization occurs in several large gold deposits (Darasun, Sredne-Golgotayskoe, Umunskoe, etc.). Its age in relation to magmatism has not been constrained yet. This study explores in details the mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of gold-bismuth mineralization in comparison with the other deposits in Transbaikalia. Analysis of geology, as well as geochemical and isotopic studies show that gold-bismuth mineralization can be spatially and genetically linked with the formation of magmatic rocks of the Porphyry Complex of Late Jurassic age.
