Geoparks are a relatively new concept with the Global Geopark Network being established in 2004, and extensive data has not yet been collected from geopark visitors to determine if these sites contribute to public awareness of geological topics. In many ways, geoparks are similar to zoos and museums and serve as centres for informal learning. They provide geological, historical and cultural stories and allow scientists to contribute to informal learning by communicating their research to the general public in an understandable fashion using a variety of methods. One mandate of the UNESCO-supported Global Geopark Network is the promotion of geoeducation. Geopark visitors who are science literate are better able to fully appreciate and understand geological significance. In the current study, we surveyed visitors’ awareness and knowledge of the geopark and geology/earth science and compared responses from visitors at a newly established Global Geopark (Stonehammer, Canada) and an established Global Geopark in England (English Riviera). Regardless of the fact that the English Riviera Geopark was more mature and therefore had more opportunity to develop and promote its educational programmes, the results of the current study did not indicate that there was a higher awareness and/or knowledge levels among geopark visitors to an established geopark. This may simply be a result of the hype and attention given to the establishment of a new “attraction” in a community and, if so, would confirm the importance of continuous promotion. © 2014, The European Association for Conservation of the Geological Heritage.
