This study mainly concentrates on the determination of site effects for the Plio-Quaternary and especially alluvial soils of the Çubuk district and its close vicinity in Ankara, Turkey. In the study area, particularly in the vicinity of the asymmetric graben that has formed due to the tectonic activities along the NE-SW trending normal faults, a microtremor survey was implemented to identify the local site response under a possible seismic event. The results were compared and correlated by using passive and active surface wave measurements, engineering geological and geotechnical deep borehole logs along with information on local geology and geological tectonic setting. Regarding the microtremor results, larger fundamental periods were acquired than expected over the area and the effect of the tectonic deformation on the stiffness of the soils was also observed at either the H/V curves or the shear wave velocity profiles. The results have demonstrated that geotechnical information down to a depth of 30. m may not be compared with the H/V parameters. The H/V amplitudes were not always accompanied with the higher periods in the Quaternary sediments. This could be due to the basin and basin edge effects observed particularly at the center and boundary of the basin, respectively. Additionally, the microtremor survey showed that the spectral ratio amplitudes derived by the H/V ratio are debatable and are not a direct indicator of local soil behavior under a seismic excitation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
