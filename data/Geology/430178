Seismic shothole drillers' logs, record the near-surface (avg. 18.6. m deep) lithostratigraphy encountered when drilling holes to place explosive charges. These records offer a largely unrecognized wealth of geoscience information in areas for which little may be otherwise known. Stored in the Basic Files archives of petroleum exploration and seismic acquisition companies, this study first convinced companies of the potential utility of this data, then recovered the hard copy and digitally scanned records (paper, fiche, microfilm) and rendered these into a digital database and GIS. The final database of 343,989 records provides the largest source of geoscience information of its kind in northwestern Canada, and in many cases contains unique and original records on a host of subjects including surficial-, bedrock-, and hydro-geology, permafrost, and geohazards. The drillers' log records have further been used to create geospatial models of drift, till, muskeg, massive ice and ground ice thicknesses, and continue to be applied to new avenues of research such as temporal variations of bottomfast ice extents in offshore shallow marine environments. Published in freely downloadable Geological Survey of Canada Open File reports and providing commonly used database and GIS file formats, this data rescue exercise preserves and greatly enhances what was becoming an increasingly discarded corporate data set of unrecognized potential.
