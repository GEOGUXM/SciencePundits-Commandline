The study area, which will be open to tourism in Kusadasi (Aydin), has steep and high cliffs on the Aegean coast in Turkey. Flysch is the main lithological unit and consists of alternating sandstone–claystone–marl sequences. Some sliding and rockfall problems have occurred in the area in the past, so potential geological hazards need to be investigated to ensure the safety of tourists. The aim of this study is to mitigate geological hazards by recommending engineering solutions, which will ensure the continuation of the nature-friendly appearance of the slopes. To accomplish these tasks, a geological survey was performed. It involved gathering information on rock discontinuities by means of scan-line surveys and collection of rock samples. Furthermore, in situ and laboratory tests were also carried out. The data collected from the field and laboratory test results were used to perform slope stability and rockfall (2-D and 3-D) analyses for different slope conditions along 43 profiles. Based on the analyses, rockfall was found to be the main slope instability problem in the study area. Under the light of these studies, rock removal, drainage, greening (vegetation), filling of caverns, protective wall building and erosion prevention are offered as remedial measures. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg
