Organic ultraviolet (UV) filters are used widely in various personal care products and their ubiquitous occurrence in the aquatic environment has been reported in recent years. However, data on their fate and potential impacts in marine sediments is limited. This study reports the occurrence and risk assessment of eleven widely used organic UV filters in marine sediment collected in Hong Kong and Tokyo Bay. Seven of the 11 target UV filters were detected in all sediment samples (median concentrations: <MLOD-21. ng/g dry weight) with detection frequencies higher in the wet season than in the dry season. Composition profiles showed that BMDM, EHMC and ODPABA were the predominant compounds, accounting for more than 60% of the total UV filter occurrence; this was likely due to their relatively higher octanol-water partition coefficients. Probabilistic ecological risk assessment showed that the likelihood of EHMC causing toxic effects on reproduction in snails was over 84% and 32% based on toxicity data for two species, respectively, suggesting potential risks of UV filters to benthic organisms and possible wider effects on the marine food web. However, more toxicity data for sediment organisms is necessary for better risk assessment of these compounds in benthic communities. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
