We present the first image of the Madeira upper crustal structure, using ambient seismic noise tomography. 16. months of ambient noise, recorded in a dense network of 26 seismometers deployed across Madeira, allowed reconstructing Rayleigh wave Green's functions between receivers. Dispersion analysis was performed in the short period band from 1.0 to 4.0. s. Group velocity measurements were regionalized to obtain 2D tomographic images, with a lateral resolution of 2.0. km in central Madeira. Afterwards, the dispersion curves, extracted from each cell of the 2D group velocity maps, were inverted as a function of depth to obtain a 3D shear wave velocity model of the upper crust, from the surface to a depth of 2.0. km. The obtained 3D velocity model reveals features throughout the island that correlates well with surface geology and island evolution. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
