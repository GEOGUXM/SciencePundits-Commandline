A conceptual model was developed for a hydrogeological flow system in the southern Outaouais Region, Quebec, Canada, where the local population relies heavily on groundwater pumped from shallow overburden aquifers and from deeper fractured crystalline bedrock. The model is based on the interpretation of aqueous inorganic geochemical data from 14 wells along a cross-section following the general flow direction, of which 9 were also analysed for isotopes (δ18O, δ2H, 3H, δ13C, 14C) and 4 for noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Xe, Kr). Three major water types were identified: (1) Ca-HCO<inf>3</inf> in the unconfined aquifer as a result of silicate (Ca-feldspar) weathering, (2) Na-Cl as a remnant of the post-glacial Champlain Sea in stagnant confined zones of the aquifer, and (3) Na-HCO<inf>3</inf>, resulting from freshening of the confined aquifer due to Ca-Na cation exchange. Chemical data also allowed the identification of significant mixing zones. Isotope and noble gas data confirm the hypothesis of remnant water from the Champlain Sea and also support the hypothesis of mixing processes between a young tritium-rich component with an older component containing high 4He concentrations. It is still unclear if the mixing occurs under natural flow conditions or if it is induced by pumping during the sampling, most wells being open boreholes in the bedrock. It is clear, however, that the hydrogeochemical system is dynamic and still evolving from induced changes since the last glaciation. As a next step, the conceptual model will serve as a basis for groundwater flow, mass transport and geochemical modelling to validate the hypotheses developed in this paper. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
