Prominent eroded volcanic features often dominate landscapes and stimulate interest in the geological processes that formed these landscapes. Trimble SketchUp (formerly Google SketchUp and hereinafter simply SketchUp) can be used by educators as a comprehensive geological teaching tool to model the complex processes, stages of formation, and key features of a volcanic region. This study outlines the constraints and considerations which must be taken into account when developing a virtual geological representation, the procedure of creating a model of the observed geology using SketchUp, and the methods through which educators can convey the embedded information at various academic levels. In developing a geological model, an understanding of the physical processes within the formation and degradation of geological features is integral. This understanding requires field observations, measurements and supportive analysis. A hypothetical model (informed and constrained by geological information) is then formulated and visualized using the 3D SketchUp environment. By using the framework of SketchUp, a full spectrum interactive geologically accurate model of the formation can be visualized and interacted with via geospatial layers, enabling an understanding of intrusive, eruptive, and erosional processes.
