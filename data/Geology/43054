The PS2644 deep-sea core sequence, retrieved from the northwestern margin of Iceland and covering the last 86. ka, exhibits high sedimentation rates during the last glacial cycle that allow the clear distinction of Greenland stadial (GS)/interstadial (GI) cycles in the various proxy records. Abundance records of rhyolitic, basaltic and tachylytic tephra grains reveal several maxima. Tephra grains of all types were geochemically analyzed in 44 levels. A total of 92 tephras with a distinctive character have been defined within the glacial sequence of gravity core PS2644-5, whereas the Holocene record is dominated by reworked Vedde Ash grains and not suitable for tephra stratigraphic work. Of the 92 tephras only 19 geochemical populations have been linked with confidence to previously defined tephras such as from the Vedde Ash, Faeroe Marine Ash Zones (FMAZ) II and III and North Atlantic Ash Zone (NAAZ) II. For the glacial period informal names were given to 78 new tephras, most of which are basaltic tephras. Several of these layers have a unique geochemical character and might become new chronostratigraphic markers in the North Atlantic region. Linking the tephra populations to the volcanic system producing them, respectively, revealed that Icelandic eruptions dominate with 83 tephra geochemical populations and Jan Mayen with 9. Around 48% of the informal tephra layers linked to the Icelandic volcanic province are produced from either the Grimsvötn or the Veidivötn-Bardarbunga volcanic systems. The intervals spanning from Greenland Stadial (GS) 3 to Greenland Interstadial (GI) 4 (24.5-29. ka BP), from GI 8 to GS 10 (36.9-40.5. ka BP) and from GI 14 to GI 15.2 (50-56. ka BP) are the periods with the highest number of eruptions, all of which are associated with known tephra zones. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
