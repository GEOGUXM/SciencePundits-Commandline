Mercury pollution resulting from artisanal gold mining is a serious environmental problem in many developing countries. In this study, we analyzed heavy metal(loid) contamination in mine wastes from a Carlin-type gold mine in southwestern Guizhou, China. Highly elevated levels of As, Hg, Tl, Sb, and Cd—up to 5844, 28, 29, 581 and 3.0 mg/kg, respectively—were observed in the mine wastes, but no significant accumulation of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb was found. The smelting process of gold ores had significant impacts on the enrichment of As, Tl, and Hg in the mine wastes. Due to the significant metal(loid) pollution in this gold mine, the ecological risks are classified as “very high.” Hg and As are the major pollutants with a relative contribution of 55.9 % and 24.2 % to the risk index, respectively. Phytoremediation could be used to reduce heavy metal contamination and recycle the gold simultaneously. Hg–As–Tl pollution should be considered in gold extraction at Carlin-type gold mines. © 2015 Science Press, Institute of Geochemistry, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg
