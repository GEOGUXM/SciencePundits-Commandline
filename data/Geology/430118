The unusual occurrence of calcretes and prominent organic matter in the Middle Jurassic (Lower Bathonian, Serra de Aire Formation) of the Lusitanian Basin of western Portugal (Western Iberian Margin) revealed a complex palimpsest exposure record, here interpreted as reflecting hydrological changes caused by phases of emergence and immersion. It serves as a potential model for understanding stratigraphic development at lowstand surfaces in carbonate successions. The exposure-dominated facies association grades upwards into peritidal and lagoonal limestones, and the interval is assigned to the regressive peak of a Transgressive-Regressive Facies Cycle (2nd order) of the thick Middle Jurassic carbonate ramp succession.The Galinha Quarry, Fátima region, NE of Lisbon, a type section for this lowstand assemblage, exhibits varied calcretes, with black-clasts, interbedded with, and grading into: organic-rich marly/clayey seams and lenses, locally with carbonate nodules; carbonates with evaporite traces; microbial laminites; black-clast and fenestral limestones; some lithofacies are dolomitized. The palynofacies contains phytoclasts associated with less refractory, more prone to degradation components, which suggests natural combustion/pyrolysis (wild fires). The lowstand surface represents a low relief landscape with small depressions/ponds bordering a more distal marginal-littoral setting; the partly subaerial and partly subaqueous settings were subjected to lengthy exposure and to fluctuating, very shallow water bodies and water table. Coeval climatic regime was a seasonally dry/wet one, with dry/semi-arid phases dominating over the sub-humid, as shown by the combined record of intense calcrete development, rhizogenic structures, microbial mats, brecciation, desiccation, evaporites and wild fire evidence. However, sea level rise caused changes to shallow, sea-water influenced restricted lagoonal-peritidal settings.Comparisons and differences with modern and ancient coast marginal carbonates are made to provide a guide to the variability in such lowstand deposystems in the stratigraphic record. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..
