The Cenozoic Urumieh-Dokhtar Magmatic Belt (UDMB) of Iran is a major host to porphyry Cu. ±. Mo. ±. Au deposits (PCDs). Most known PCDs in the UDMB occur in the southern section of the belt, also known as the Kerman Copper Belt (KCB). Three major clusters of PCDs are distinguished in the KCB and include the Miduk, Sarcheshmeh and Daraloo clusters. The Daraloo and Sarmeshk deposits occur in a northwest-southeast-trending fault zone that is characterized by the presence of a narrow zone of alteration-mineralization that contains a series of Oligocene granitoids and Miocene porphyritic tonalite-granodiorite plutons that cut Eocene andesitic lava flows and pyroclastic rocks. Here we use various techniques, including different ratio images, minimum noise fraction, pixel purity index, and matched filter processing to process ASTER data (14 bands) and generate maps that portray the distribution of hydrothermal minerals (e.g., sericite, kaolinite, chlorite, epidote and carbonate) related to PCD alteration zones. In order to validate the ASTER data, follow-up ground proofing and related mineralogical work was done which, in all cases, proved to be positive. The results of this work have identified the regional distribution of hypogene alteration zones (i.e., phyllic, argillic, propylitic and silicic), in addition to areas of secondary Fe-oxide formation, which are coincident with known sites of PCDs. The regional distribution and extent of the alteration zones identified also highlighted the role of regional structures in focusing the mineralizing/altering fluids. These results demonstrate very convincingly that ASTER imagery that uses the appropriate techniques is reliable and robust in mapping out the extent of hydrothermal alteration and lithological units, and can be used for targeting hydrothermal ore deposits, particularly porphyry copper deposits where the alteration footprint is sizeable. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
