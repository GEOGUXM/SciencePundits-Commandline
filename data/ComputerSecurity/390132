To make cloud computing environments more secure, this paper focuses on the security of virtualized server systems. A security layer is introduced to the secure architecture of a virtualized server as an abstraction. Because the security layer will play a key role in securing the virtualized server, there is a need for it to be sufficiently robust to tackle the most common security threats associated with cloud computing. First, security threats to cloud computing are analysed based on a publication from an international organization and the security issues surrounding virtualized servers are clarified. Following this, the security elements and their functions for each of the security requirements for virtualized servers are defined. The relationship between the security issues and security elements is then presented to verify the effectiveness of the security layer. It is shown that, using the proposed security elements, the security issues facing virtualized server systems in cloud computing are adequately mitigated. Therefore, our research will be helpful in the development of virtualized servers by making cloud computing more secure. Â© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
