A two-party authenticated key agreement (2PAKA) protocol based on Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and the self-certified public key (SC-PKC) of the user is proposed in this paper. Although several ECC-based 2PAKA protocols using either public key infrastructure (PKI) or Identity-based cryptosystem (IBC) have been proposed recently, they suffer from certain limitations. For instance, the former requires heavy computation and management of public key certificate (PKC) and the latter induces a private key escrow problem as the private key is generated by a trusted third party, called private key generator (PKG). Also the man-in-the-middle attack may occur from a malicious PKG and the resilience against such an attack for an authenticated key agreement protocol is needed. In this paper, we proposed the design of a 2PAKA protocol using ECC and SC-PKC that removes all the limitations as mentioned above. In SC-PKC, a trusted third party, called system authority (SA) generates the public key of a user based on user identity signed by SA and user generated signature based on the private key of the user. The proposed scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model under the Computational Diffie–Hellman assumption. Also the formal security validation of our scheme using Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications software is done and simulation results prove that it is safe against both the active and passive adversaries. In addition, our protocol is computationally efficient and may be considered as an alternative of the PKI- or IBC-based 2PAKA protocol. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
