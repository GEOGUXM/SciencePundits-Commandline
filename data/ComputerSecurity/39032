Recently, the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has drawn considerable attention from both industry and academia. In the IoT, millions of objects with sensors collect data and send the data to servers that analyze, manage and use the data in order to construct some kinds of smart systems, such as smart grid, intelligent transportation systems, healthcare systems and even smart city. It is critical to establish a secure channel between the sensors and servers in order to ensure the correctness of collected data. If the collected data is tampered, the results of data analysis is unbelievable, and may even bring serious disaster. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous ring signcryption scheme for secure communication from sensors to servers. We prove that this scheme has the indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2) and existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen messages attacks under the computational Diffie–Hellman problem in the random oracle model. Our scheme has the following advantages (1) it simultaneously achieves confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and anonymity in a logical single step; (2) it is heterogeneous and allows a sensor node in an identity-based cryptography to send a message to a server in a public key infrastructure. These features make our scheme suitable for data transmission in the IoT. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
