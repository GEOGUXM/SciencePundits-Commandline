Systems-on-chip (SoCs) based on many core architectures can be attacked. Malicious processes can infer secrets from on-chip sensible traffic by evaluating the degradation on their communication performance. Such a threat rises from the resource sharing. In order to avoid such time-driven attacks, the network-on-chip (NoC) can integrate mechanisms to isolate different communication flows. In this letter, we propose two mechanisms, random arbitration and adaptive routing, that dynamically allocate the SoC resources to avoid such attacks. We compare our approach to the unique previous work under several traffic conditions. We demonstrate that our mechanisms are effective to protect the SoC while increasing the overall performance.
