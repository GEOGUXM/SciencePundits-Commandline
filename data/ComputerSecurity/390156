AVS2 is a new generation of video coding standard developed by the IEEE 1857 Working Group under project 1857.4. AVS2 is also the second-generation video coding standard established by the Audio and Video Coding Standard (AVS) Working Group of China; the first-generation AVS1 was developed by the AVS Working Group and issued as Chinese national standard GB/T 20090.2-2006 in 2006. The AVS Working Group was founded in 2002 and is dedicated to providing the digital audio-video industry with highly efficient and economical coding/decoding technologies. So far, the AVS1 video coding standard is widely implemented in regional broadcasting, communication, and digital video entertainment systems. As the successor of AVS1, AVS2 is designed to achieve significant coding efficiency improvements relative to the preceding H.264/MPEG4-AVC and AVS1 standards. The basic coding framework of AVS2 is similar to the conterminous HEVC/H.265, but AVS2 can provide more efficient compression for certain video applications such as surveillance as well as low-delay communication such as videoconferencing. AVS2 is making video coding smarter by adopting intelligent coding tools that not only improve coding efficiency but also help with computer vision tasks such as object detection and tracking.
