Real-Time path planning can efficiently relieve traffic congestion in urban scenarios. However, how to design an efficient path-planning algorithm to achieve a globally optimal vehicle-Traffic control still remains a challenging problem, particularly when we take drivers' individual preferences into consideration. In this paper, we first establish a hybrid intelligent transportation system (ITS), i.e., a hybrid-VANET-enhanced ITS, which utilizes both vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) and cellular systems of the public transportation system to enable real-Time communications among vehicles, roadside units (RSUs), and a vehicle-Traffic server in an efficient way. Then, we propose a real-Time path-planning algorithm, which not only improves the overall spatial utilization of a road network but reduces average vehicle travel cost for avoiding vehicles from getting stuck in congestion as well. A stochastic Lyapunov optimization technique is exploited to address the globally optimal path-planning problem. Finally, the transmission delay of the hybrid-VANET-enhanced ITS is evaluated in VISSIM to show the timeliness of the proposed communication framework. Moreover, system-level simulations conducted in Java demonstrate that the proposed path-planning algorithm outperforms the traditional distributed path planning in terms of balancing the spatial utilization and drivers' travel cost.
