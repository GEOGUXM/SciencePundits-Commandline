In more recent years peer-to-peer systems are becoming more popular in the area of research because of possessing a number of challenging issues. The entire P2P research can be divided into four areas: search, storage, security and sharing. In various circumstances, the P2P network makes sense in effective communication. The P2P networking increases the QOS, in terms of communication speed, delay, data success rate and less data loss and so on. Due to its open nature system, it deployed hugely in the area of transferring large files and it easily exposes them to the malicious activities. The election of malicious or compromised peer as a peer head is one of the most significant breaches in peer-to-peer networks. In light of these issues, we focus the improvement of P2P network performance by following the given mechanisms. Mechanism 1: topology construction based on grouping of similar interest peer (GOSIP). Mechanism 2: electing the peer-heads for each GOSIP, based on the trust-threshold value given by each peers about their neighbor peers and considering the MAC address of the top listed peers in each group. In this paper, the P2P functionality is improved in such a way that the number of request is reduced and the neighborhood peers communication is improved by finding optimized neighbor using GOSIP algorithm. We have taken these mechanisms into the test-bed through simulation. The simulations outcomes flashed out clearly that these methods significantly improve 25 % of network Scalability and 50 % of throughputs, in turn improvise the performance of P2P networks efficiently when compared to the existing methodologies.
