Software Defined Radios (SDRs) are wireless communication systems in which many of the radios' important functional elements, including filtering, frequency translation and modulation/demodulation, are implemented in software via Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques using embedded processors and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) as described by Harris and Lowdermilk in 2010 [1]. SDRs differ from traditional radios that typically employ custom silicon to implement such functions. SDRs exhibit several advantages over traditional radios, including re-configurability and reduced development costs and time-to-market since they do not require custom silicon. SDRs also enjoy long life cycles, since they can readily be adapted to meet future needs. Cognitive Radios (CRs) are a special class of SDRs that employ adaptive DSP technologies to implement spectral management. This enables CRs to deliver improved effective bandwidth, quality of service, and enhanced security, which have become increasingly important in modern commercial and military wireless communications applications.
