The Art Therapy Draw! app includes two of them in its design: a portfolio option, and stronger security. Five art therapists evaluated the app through a System Usability Scale (SUS). The evaluation revealed both positive qualities of the program and areas requiring improvement. Overall, the layout of the app proved easy to navigate and required little knowledge to operate. It offered more security measures than other apps. In addition, the expert users commented that the app would likely be suitable for use with disabled persons or those allergic to conventional art materials. This study marks a step toward instituting design considerations for emerging mobile art therapy. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
