Detecting anomalies in surveillance videos, that is, finding events or objects with low probability of occurrence, is a practical and challenging research topic in computer vision community. In this paper, we put forward a novel unsupervised learning framework for anomaly detection. At feature level, we propose a Sparse Semi-nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SSMF) to learn local patterns at each pixel, and a Histogram of Nonnegative Coefficients (HNC) can be constructed as local feature which is more expressive than previously used features like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). At model level, we learn a probability model which takes the spatial and temporal contextual information into consideration. Our framework is totally unsupervised requiring no human-labeled training data. With more expressive features and more complicated model, our framework can accurately detect and localize anomalies in surveillance video. We carried out extensive experiments on several benchmark video datasets for anomaly detection, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our framework to state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of our framework.
