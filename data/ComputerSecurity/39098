There has been tremendous increase in both the different types of Mobile Health (mHealth) applications and the number of applications being created for both the clinical and consumer healthcare space. The rapid proliferation of mHealth applications is creating confusion in the domain among both consumers and healthcare professionals due to uncertainty about reliability, security, regulation, and integration concerns. New applications are being developed faster than researchers, patients, and healthcare professionals can grasp the multiplicity of the mHealth applications and the various ways they can be used. This paper proposes a taxonomy of existing and emerging mHealth applications to help all users understand this domain. Â© 2015, IUPESM and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
