We present a serial communication system implemented as quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA). QCA is a promising alternative to the current CMOS technology. It can be implemented at the nanoscale, reaching ultra-low power consumption and high clock rate. Communication systems are important in current computer systems and it is expected to be even more important in near future. Although QCA has been widely studied in the development of logic circuits, there are few studies applying this promising technology to the design of communication systems. In a bottom-up approach, we describe the parallel-to-serial and serial-to-parallel converters, which are essential to the serial communication. We also propose and present components for robust communication, such as QCA circuits for Hamming code and parity checker. We demonstrate the functionality, test and validate the proposed architectures using QCADesigner simulator. Due to the importance of communication systems, this study is central in consolidating QCA as a possible CMOS substitute. Â© 2002-2012 IEEE.
