Due to the secure problems of low-dimensional chaos in image encryption and cycle degradation caused by computers’ finite precision, a perturbed high-dimensional chaos is designed for image encryption according to Devaney and topological conjugate definition. Perturbation is added to the new high-dimensional chaos to enlarge cycle. The characteristics of the high-dimensional chaotic map are proved by Devaney definition, and the security features are analyzed. Owe to the periodic defects of Cat map, a new separated Cat map is designed for the confusion process. The “confusion–diffusion” structure is used in the image encryption. The security test results demonstrate the proposed methods have high security, and the speed of our algorithm is faster than classical solutions. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht
