Life is not a game. But there are similarities. That's why it's worthwhile to invent artificial-intelligence algorithms that can win games. One such AI has now finally solved one of the simplest versions of poker. It's a crucial first step on a potentially long road toward beating human poker champions in more complex versions of the games. This isn't just about bragging rights: Poker playing can train computer algorithms to tackle the complexities of real-world challenges in security and medicine, where the available information is rarely perfect or complete.
