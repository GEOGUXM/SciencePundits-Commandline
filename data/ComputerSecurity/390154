Vulnerabilities in low-level systems software leave users exposed to malware, theft, and monitoring. Automatic software diversity makes weaponization of these vulnerabilities much harder. The premise of software diversity is simple: randomizing program features conceals them from adversaries; however, securely and transparently implementing automatic software diversity is anything but simple.
