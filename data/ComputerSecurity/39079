Emergence of new applications like cloud computing, video on demand or deployment of high-speed cellular network lead to an increasing demand of high-speed short reach transmission for access network or datacenter. Due to the low sensitivity of PIN receiver and the lack of APD above 10 Gb/s, optical preamplification is a promising concept for high-speed receiver. We demonstrate an SOA-PIN/TIA receiver module which integrates an SOA-PIN photonic circuit and a TIA. This receiver has a large responsivity of 44 A/W, a polarization dependence below 2 dB, a low noise figure of 8.5 dB and a large 3-dB bandwidth of 35 GHz. Our new developed receiver achieved in NRZ a record sensitivity of-23 and-21 dBm at 25 and 40 Gb/s, respectively. Â© 2015 IEEE.
