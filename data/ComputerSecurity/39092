Network resources in mobile ad hoc wireless networks (MANETs) are constrained due to their dynamic topology and lack of centralized control. Mobile nodes in MANETs tend to broadcast packets to exchange information and consume lots of network resources such as network bandwidth and battery power of each node during forwarding their packets. Hence, the conserving network resource is crucial to maintain the quality of network services without interruptions. In order to discover an ideal routing algorithm that should use minimum network resources and improve network performance, we propose an adaptive-gossiping routing algorithm that saves network bandwidth and energy consumption at each node by reducing the duplicated routing messages. Our new analytical model of adaptive-gossiping probability (Formula presented.) provides a less routing overhead which results in conserving network resources and reducing the end-to-end delay. The both analytical and experimental results of our proposed method confirm its advantages over flooding and static-gossiping based routing protocols in large-scale networks.
