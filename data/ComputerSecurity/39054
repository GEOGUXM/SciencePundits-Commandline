The cytogenotoxicity and histopathological alterations induced by xenobiotics in Lekki Lagoon and Ogun River on Synodontis clarias were investigated. Fish from these water bodies and a fish farm (control) were examined for micronucleated, binucleated, and immature erythrocytes in both gill and peripheral blood. Also gill, liver, kidney, and ovary were processed for histopathology using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Concentrations of cadmium, zinc, lead and copper in the water were determined. There was significant (p < 0.05) increase in micronucleated, binucleated, and immature erythrocytes in both gill and peripheral blood of S. clarias from the lagoon and river compared to the reference site. Loss and disorganization of the primary and secondary lamellae, multifocal degeneration, hemorrhages, cellular infiltration, congestions, vacuolations, atresia, and necrosis were common lesions in the examined tissues of fish from the lagoon and river. Cd, Zn, Pb, and Cu in water samples from the lagoon and river were higher than the reference site. Xenobiotics in Lekki Lagoon and Ogun River, mostly metals, induced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and pathological damage in S. clarias. Â© 2015 Taylor & Francis
