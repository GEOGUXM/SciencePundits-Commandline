We propose a method for image/video encryption that combines double random-phase encoding in the Fresnel domain with a single shot digital holography. In this method, a complex object field can be reconstructed with only single frame hologram based on a constrained optimization method. The system without multiple shots and Fourier lens is simple, and allows to dynamically encrypt information. We test the proposed method on a computer simulated image, a grayscale image and a video in AVI format. Also we investigate the quality of the decryption process and the performance against noise attacks. The experimental results demonstrate the performance of the method. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
