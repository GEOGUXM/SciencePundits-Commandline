Objective: To investigate the clinicopathologic morphology, immunophenotype, diagnosis and differential diagnosis of HIV/AIDS related Burkitt lymphoma (BL). Methods: According to WHO (2008) classification of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue tumors, we analyzed 10 cases of HIV/AIDS related BL collected from August 2010 to March 2013, using methods of HE staining, immunohistochemical EnVision dyeing, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and in situ hybridization combined with clinical data. Results: Ten biospy were done, among which 4 cases were armpit lump, 3 neck lump, 1 inguinal mass, and 2 abdominal mass. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor cells showed that expression of IgM, CD20, CD19, CD79a, CD10 and Bcl-6 were positive, while they were negative for CD5, CD21, CD30, EMA, Bcl-2, CD3, ALK-1 and TdT. The proliferation index of all cases of Ki67 was higher than 90%. CD38 and MUM-1 were expressed in 1 case, c-myc in 3 cases, LMP-1 in 1 case, and mutant P53 in 5 cases. EBER was detected by in situ hybridization in 3 cases, C-MYC fracture of recombinant gene t(8; 14) (q24; q32) was detected by FISH in 8 cases. Pathological diagnosis: 9 cases were classical BL and 1 case was BL with plasma cell differentiation. Conclusions: HIV-BL is a highly malignant lymphoma with poor prognosis. It is easy to confuse with diffuse large B cell lymphoma and lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia in light microscopy. Combining with its typical pathological changes, immunohistochemistry and FISH technique could be help on pathological diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Â©, 2015, Fudan University.
