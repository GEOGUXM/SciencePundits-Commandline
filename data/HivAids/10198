Background: AIDS is a serious disease worldwide. Prevention has been shown to be more effective than treatment in the effort to control and end the threat of this disease. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of an HIV/AIDS prevention education program on adolescents living in a primarily indigenous area of Taiwan. Methods: This study used secondary data prepared by the Health Center of one indigenous township in 2011. Authors analyzed the dataset retrospectively. A 2-week HIV/AIDS prevention education program was arranged for a single group of 50 students from one junior high school and a pretest and posttest were conducted. A total of 45 valid questionnaires were completed. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, the McNemar test, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: Results indicate that the education program improved the knowledge (p < .001) and attitude (p < .05) of participants significantly between pretest and posttest. The posttest score for knowledge (9.47 ± 3.24) was significantly higher than the pretest score (6.11 ± 3.84). The posttest score for positive attitude (3.72 ± 0.36) was also significantly higher than the pretest score (3.43 ± 0.34). Conclusions / Implications for Practice: This AIDS prevention education program significantly improved the related knowledge and attitudes of participants. Schools and health units may reference the results of this study to design materials for prevention of HIV/AIDS, particularly in the context of indigenous adolescents. © 2015, Taiwan Nurses Association.
