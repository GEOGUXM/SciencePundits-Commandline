Objective: To determine the levels of NT-pro BNP in HIV patients over 40 years who are receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and investigating potential independent clinical or laboratory factors. Method: We determine levels of NT-pro BNP in peripheral blood of HIV patients from Costa del Sol Hospital, over 40 years. Results: Nt-pro BNP levels were determined in 146 HIV patients. We assess the 10-year cardiovascular risk calculated by the Framingham equation, 59 (41.5%) were classified as low risk, 46 (32.4%) as a moderate risk and 37 (26.1%) as a high risk. The higher levels of NT-pro BNP were found in women, and in those patient with lower filtration rate and high levels of triglycerides. An association was also observed between higher levels of NT-proBNP and the recent use of lamivudine and fosamprenavir. After a multivariate analysis we found an association between higher levels of NT-proBNP and the current use of fosamprenavir and a lower glomerular filtration rate. Conclusions: We found, with the limitations of a small serie, that higher levels of NTproBNP in HIV patients could be linked to the occurrence of cardiovascular events, this fact suggest that NTpro BNP could be used in patients at moderate or high vascular risk in order to optimise the primary prevention of vascular events.
