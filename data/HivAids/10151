Methods: A descriptive correlational design, involving 200 university students selected by systematic random sampling (k = 11). Results: Young people who used sexual material online rich media to masturbation (r<inf>s</inf> =.34), arousal (r<inf>s</inf> = 29), stimulation (r<inf>s</inf> = 29), adventure (r<inf>s</inf> = 30), meeting people (r<inf>s</inf> =.27), images (r<inf>s</inf> =.17) and cybersex (r<inf>s</inf> =.25) showed greater sexual risk behavior for HIV / AIDS (p <.01). The use of sexual material online for masturbation (R2 = 6.4%, F [1,189] = 12.80, p <.001), seeking adventures (R2 = 4.8%, F [1,189] = 9.56, p <.01), meeting people (R2 = 5.9%, F [1,189] = 11.88, p <.01) and have cybersex (R2 = 4.1%, F [1,189] = 8.07, p <.01) had a significant positive effect on behavior sexual risk for HIV/AIDS.
