Objectives: Most people living with HIV stay sexually active, but some remain inactive. This study investigated prevalence and correlates of sexual inactivity among European HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods: An anonymous sexual health questionnaire was distributed in 17 HIV outpatient clinics throughout Europe. Ninety-seven (11.6%) of 838 respondents reported absence of sexual activity. Results: Multivariable regression analysis identified older age, relationship status, and less satisfaction with general health and sexual desire as being associated with sexual inactivity. Conclusions: Prevalence of sexual inactivity has declined since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy to levels similar to those of HIV-negative MSM, suggesting a tendency toward normalization of HIV-positive MSM's sex lives. 2015 Copyright Â© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC
