Stigma is an important obstacle that affects access to health resources for groups vulnerable to HIV, such as female sex workers (FSW). Experiences and types of stigma are diverse, and vary across cultural settings. Consequently, research that places stigma within appropriate socio-cultural contexts should be the first step towards developing effective HIV-prevention interventions. This study examined the stigma related to engaging in sex work in a group of FSW in the Dominican Republic. The present investigation used the Sex Worker Stigma (SWS) Index to identify factors associated with sex work-related stigma along two perceived stigma domains: the community and family. A verbally administered, tablet-based questionnaire was completed by 338 FSW. Results indicate that multiple independent factors influence perceived sex work-related stigma from community and family sources. FSW who engage in sex work on an independent basis, Haitian FSW, and women who live in the same household as their dependent children perceive less sex work-related stigma from the community. Conversely, FSW who spend more time engaged in sex work per week perceive more sex work-related stigma from this source. Within the family domain, women who live in the same household as their dependent children and FSW with higher levels of education perceive less stigma from family members. FSW who provide the principal household economic support perceive more sex work-related stigma from family members. Findings show that sex work-related stigma is unique and should be taken into account for interventions focused on HIV prevention and/or stigma in female sex workers.
