Mental health concerns can exacerbate the progression and transmission of HIV/AIDS. Thus there have been calls for increased research and integration of mental health care into HIV/AIDS treatment in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the disease has reached pandemic levels. This qualitative study analyzed the open-ended survey responses of 181 individuals providing HIV/AIDS counseling in Botswana. Several themes emerged regarding the professional identity of counselors, risk of burnout, working conditions and needed resources, the process and provision of counseling in Botswana, as well as training and supervision issues. Implications and recommendations for practice and advocacy are discussed. Â© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.
