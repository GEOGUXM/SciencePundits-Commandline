Background: While HIV, AIDS and atypical Mycobacterium infections are closely linked, the use of Integrase-Inhibitor based cART, notably raltegravir-based regimens is more widespread. RAL should be double-dosed to 800mg semi-daily in situation of rifampicin co-medication, because RAL is more rapidly metabolized due to rifampicin-induced Uridine-5'-diphosph- gluronosyl-transferase (UGT1A1). Recently, it was speculated that chewed RAL might lead to increased absorption, which might compensate the inductive effect of rifampicin-rapid metabolized RAL, as part of cost-saving effects in countries with high-tuberculosis prevalence and less economic power. Methods: We report measurement of raltegravir pharmacokinetics in a 34-year AIDS-patient suffering from disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection with necessity of parenteral rifampicin treatment. RAL levels were measured with HPLC (internal standard: carbamazepine, LLQ 11ng/ml, validation with Valistat 2.0 program (Arvecon, Germany)). For statistical analysis, a two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired samples was used. Results: High intra-personal variability in raltegravir serum levels was seen. Comparable Cmax concentrations were found for 800mg chewed and swallowed RAL, as well as for 400mg chewed and swallowed RAL. While Cmax seems to be more dependent from overall RAL dosing than from swallowed or chewed tablets, increased AUC12 is clearly linked to higher RAL dosages per administration. Anyway, chewed raltegravir showed a rapid decrease in serum levels. Conclusions: We found no evidence that chewed 400mg semi-daily raltegravir in rifampicin co-medication leads to optimized pharmacokinetics. There is need for more data from randomized trials for further recommendations. Â© Spinner et al.; licensee BioMed Central.
