Alcohol consumption is strongly associated with sexual risk behavior and HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. This article seeks to explore the role of constructions of masculinity in men's drinking and sexual risk behavior in drinking venues (bars and taverns) in 2 rural villages of North West Province, South Africa. Ten focus groups were conducted with 58 bar patrons and servers. Four focus groups consisted of female bar patrons, 4 consisted of male bar patrons, and 2 consisted of male bar managers and servers. The participants' ages ranged from 18 to 43 years, and they were interviewed using focus group discussion guides with open-ended questions. Key themes identified through thematic analysis were (a) men's high levels of alcohol consumption, (b) men's tendency to blame women for men's proneness to risky sex when drinking, © men's sexual objectification of women, and (d) the far-reaching consequences of sexism and violence perpetrated by men. Policies to promote gender equality are needed to ensure that men are more gender-sensitive, engage in more balanced gender relationships, and do not uphold any destructive gender stereotypes.
