This study explored gender differences in the effectiveness of the translated VOICES (Video Opportunities for Condom Education and Safer Sex) intervention on the condom use intention, perceived benefits and barriers to condom use, condom use self-efficacy, and HIV/AIDS knowledge among Chinese students in a US university. We utilized a pretest/post-test quasi-experimental design and recruited 67 Chinese students at the local university. Participants viewed a 20-min video with Chinese subtitles, attended one 25-min small group discussion and condom interactive educational activity. Female participants showed significantly greater mean scores of perceived benefits and condom use self-efficacy, in comparison with male participants. Female participants also reported significantly higher scores than male participants in five of the perceived benefits items and one self-efficacy item. These study results provide important information for developing more differentiated intervention strategies specific to gender for HIV and STI education programs.
