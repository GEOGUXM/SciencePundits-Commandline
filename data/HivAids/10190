The treatment of malignancies in HIV patients is challenged by the issue of drug–drug interactions between antiretroviral therapy and antineoplastic agents. While protease inhibitors have been shown to increase the incidence and severity of cancer therapy-related side effects, the impact of other antiretroviral agents on the tolerability and response to chemotherapy is less well documented. We report the successful use of an etravirine-based regimen in a patient treated with BEACOPP chemotherapy for advanced Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Etravirine constitutes a valuable option for concomitant use with chemotherapy due to its moderate inducing effect on drug metabolising enzymes. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav
