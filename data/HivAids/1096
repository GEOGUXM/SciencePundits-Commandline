Cervical cancer screening rates remain suboptimal among women in South Africa (SA), where cervical cancer prevalence is high. The rollout of HIV-related services across SA may provide a means to deliver cervical cancer screening to populations with limited access to health care systems. In this mixed methods study, psychosocial factors influencing cervical cancer prevention and perceptions of the provision of Pap smears in HIV care settings were examined. Structured interviews were conducted with women (n = 67) from a municipal housing estate in Durban, SA. Key informants (n = 12) also participated in semi-structured interviews. Findings revealed that participants had low cervical cancer knowledge, but desired more information. Relevant themes included the normalisation of HIV and beliefs that cervical cancer might be worse than HIV. A comprehensive community clinic was desired by most, even if HIV-positive patients were treated there. This study provides important insight into integrating cervical cancer screening with HIV clinics, which may increase cancer screening among South African women. Â© 2015 Taylor & Francis
