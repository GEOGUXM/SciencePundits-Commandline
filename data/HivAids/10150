Stigmatizing attitudes from health professionals toward people living with HIV (PLHIV) constitute a key barrier to HIV care. Despite considerable progress in HIV stigma-reduction research, we are still searching for effective strategies that can be implemented on a larger scale. To narrow this research gap, the present study investigated a novel cost-effective approach to reducing HIV-related stigma among health professionals. Interactive experiential games were used to help participants gain first-hand experience of potential stressors that PLHIV might encounter. The effectiveness of this game-based experiential approach was compared with that of in vivo contact in reducing HIV-related stigma among students in the health-care fields. Eighty-eight students of health-related programs in Hong Kong were randomly assigned to either the game-based or in vivo contact program. They completed measures of stigmatizing attitudes and HIV/AIDS-related knowledge at pre-program, post-program, and one-month follow-up. Findings showed that the effectiveness of the game-based experiential approach in reducing HIV-related stigma was similar to that of in vivo contact both at post-program and one-month follow-up. Further research is needed to explore the potential value of the game-based approach in reducing HIV stigma among health professionals. Â© 2015 Taylor & Francis.
