Objective: To explore whether the spatial autocorrelation exists in the incidence of HIV/AIDS in Chongqing, discuss features of the spatial distribution, and analyze the trend of variation with time for hot regions. Methods: The annual incidence of HIV/AIDS of districts and counties of Chongqing from 2004 to 2012 were calculated and the global spatial autocorrelation analysis and the local spatial autocorrelation analysis were conducted. Results: The annual global Moran's I indexes from 2004 to 2012 were larger than 0 (P<0.05), which indicated that positive spatial autocorrelation existed in the data. Results of the LISA analysis showed that the cluster state was high-high or low-low. Results of the G<inf>i</inf>* analysis indicated that the hot regions expanded with time. Conclusion: The significant positive correlation exists in the spatial distribution of incidence of HIV/AIDS in Chongqing from 2004 to 2012. Hot regions expand with time, which indicates that the prevention and health care of HIV/AIDS in Chongqing should be reinforced.
