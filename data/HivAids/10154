To analyse the prevalence of high ferritin levels in asymptomatic HIV patients and its related factors we conducted a cross-sectional study of a cohort of HIV outpatients in regular follow-up. Epidemiological, clinical, analytical and therapeutic data were collected. Patients completed a questionnaire about cardiovascular risk factors and underwent a physical examination and a 12-h fasting blood analysis. High ferritin levels were defined as a plasma ferritin level >200 µg/L in women and >300 µg/L in men. A total of 571 patients (78.1% men) were included. Median age was 43.2 years, HIV sexual transmission 68.5%, median CD4 count 474 cells/µL, 36.3% AIDS cases, 86.2% on antiretroviral therapy and 74.8% of them with undetectable viral load; 14.6% metabolic syndrome criteria, and mean cardiovascular risk at 10 years 6.67%. High ferritin levels prevalence was 11%, and related factors were a CD4 count <350 cells/µL (odds ratio, OR 2.37 [1.3–4.1], p = 0.003), ultrasensitive C-reactive protein >3 mg/L (OR 2.67 [1.5–4.7], p = 0.001) and chronic hepatitis C virus infection (OR 2.77 [1.5–4.9], p = 0.001). High ferritin levels are not uncommon in HIV patients, and they correlate with immunosuppression defined as CD4 count <350 cells/µL, higher ultrasensitive C-reactive protein and hepatitis C virus infection, and in contrast to the general population, they are not related to increased cardiovascular risk or metabolic syndrome. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav
