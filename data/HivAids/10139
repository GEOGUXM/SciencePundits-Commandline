Social support is the perception and actuality that one is cared for, has assistance available from other people, and that one is part of a supportive social network. These supportive resources can be emotional, financial assistance, informational or companionship and also intangible. Social support can be measured as the perception that one has assistance available, the actual received assistance, or the degree to which a person is integrated in a social network. Support can come from many sources, such as family, friends, pets, neighbours, coworkers, organizations, etc. Those who receive social support will feel relaxed and loved. This study will discuss the support carried out by the NGO, Komuniti Cakna Terengganu (KCT), to HIVAIDS sufferers. KCT was established through an initiative from some former drug addicts who have been marginalized by their families and community. The focus of this study is to examine social support for HIV-AIDS patients and is limited to the role played by KCT. The objectives of this study are to analyze the views of patients with HIV/AIDS who received social support and to identify the obstacles faced by KCT in continuing support for the group. This study used the qualitative method with two techniques to get data; Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and observation. 18 respondents were involved in two FGD sessions. The study found that all patients are satisfied with the support given to them be it spiritual, informational or intangible. The programs are very effective and should be continued. Patients feel appreciated and gain more understanding about religion. To the respondents, religion becomes a filter for all negative things. There is a need for more NGOs such as KCT to provide support to marginalized groups such as the respondent. Government and private agencies and other NGOs should provide support in all forms to NGOs such as KCT. Â© 2015, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research. All rights reserved.
