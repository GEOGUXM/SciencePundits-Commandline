Introduction: With changed clinical profile of HIV related diseases, our study attempted to analyse otorhinolaryngological manifestations in HIV positive children coming to ART centre of a tertiary referral in South India. Materials and Methods: Records of 137 children registered at ART Centre, Government Wenlock Hospital, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore from 2004 till 2010 were studied and data for this retrospective study was collected. Results: Twenty three (16.8%) children developed otorhinolaryngological manifestations, which were upper respiratory tract infection (13.1%), oral candidiasis (1.4%), otitis media (1.4%) and parotitis (1%). With increasing WHO stage, the ENT manifestations increased (p<0.05) while CD4 count decreased (p>0.05), 35% and 44% cases with ENT manifestations had CD4 counts above 500 cells/mm3 and below 200 cells/mm3 respectively (p>0.05). 24% children on HAART and 10.7% not on HAART developed ENT illnesses (p<0.05). Conclusion: With the current ART protocols, ENT manifestations are seen in 17% HIV positive children, most of which are aspecific. Â© 2015, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.
