Oral candidiasis is the most common fungal opportunistic infection to affect the oral cavity among HIV patients. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has changed the epidemiology of candidiasis, with many studies reporting a decrease in prevalence. However, some studies report rare cases of increased prevalence. This systematic review clarifies the role of oral candidiasis in the HAART era as a marker of immune status and successful therapy for the HIV-infected population.
