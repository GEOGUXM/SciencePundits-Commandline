In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy era, medication adherence and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) have become critical issues for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). The purpose of this study was to test explanatory models of how patient–provider interaction and patient satisfaction are related to medication adherence and HRQOL for PLWH. A total of 344 PLWH receiving health-care services from a federally funded clinic in the southwest USA completed a survey questionnaire about their perception of interactions with providers, their satisfaction with services, their medication adherence, and their HRQOL. Comparing four latent variable structural equation models of direct and mediated effects of patient–provider interaction and patient satisfaction, the findings illustrate that the best model is one in which patient–provider interaction has a direct and positive effect on patient satisfaction, medication adherence, and HRQOL. These findings suggest that quality patient–provider interaction is a critical element of health-care services for PLWH, while patient satisfaction is an outcome measure and not a mediating factor for medication adherence and HRQOL. © 2015 Taylor & Francis
