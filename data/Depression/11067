Depressive rumination is the tendency to repeatedly dwell on the causes and meanings of negative symptoms, feelings, and problems. It has been robustly implicated as an important mechanism in the onset and maintenance of depression, and has recently been proposed as a potential therapy target to improve treatment efficacy. I describe emerging trial research on psychological therapies that target rumination, which provides encouraging preliminary evidence that rumination-focused interventions may enhance treatment outcome, although key limitations are noted, including the lack of a definitive comparison to existing therapies. Recent advances in cognitive bias modification that implicate cognitive biases in the maintenance of rumination are highlighted as indicating that this approach has potential to treat rumination.
