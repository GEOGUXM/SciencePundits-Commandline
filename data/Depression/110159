This study examined whether perceived neighborhood factors were associated with positive well-being in older adults using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Neighborhood perceptions were assessed at baseline (2006/2007) and three measures of well-being - hedonic, eudaimonic and evaluative - were assessed at baseline and follow-up (2010/2011) for 6134 participants. In cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, negative neighborhood perceptions were associated with poorer well-being on all three measures. These associations remained significant after adjusting for a range of sociodemographic and health status variables and depressive symptoms. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
