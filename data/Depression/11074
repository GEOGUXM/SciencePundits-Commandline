The study of the genetic underpinnings of human memory has important implications for the understanding of memory-related molecular processes. Here we show that human genetic research has contributed to such understanding. While candidate gene studies have partially confirmed animal-based hypotheses, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided evidence for novel memory-related genes. In this article we review candidate gene and GWAS findings related to working memory, episodic memory and emotional memory in healthy cohorts. These memory types are disturbed in neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Studies on the genetic underpinnings of memory functions in healthy cohorts are important for a better understanding of physiological processes and for the identification of novel drug targets related to such conditions.
