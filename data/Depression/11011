Data on students' perceptions of social support, traditional and cyber victimization behavior, and social-emotional well-being were collected from a sample of 267 university students in the Midwestern United States. One purpose of the current study was to examine possible sex differences in perceptions of the prevalence of cybervictimization experiences. The current study also examined whether cybervictimization accounted for additional variance in depression beyond traditional victimization and if social support would buffer the associations among traditional and cyber victimization and depression. Young men and women did not report significantly different rates of cybervictimization. Cybervictimization was significantly related to depression above and beyond that of traditional victimization. Social support was negatively related to depression. However, there was no moderating role of social support. The results of this study highlight the significant impact that traditional and cyber victimization may have on college students' well-being. Social support was also an important factor in the relation to depression, however, it did not provide a buffer in the association between victimization and depression.
