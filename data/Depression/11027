Abstract Background Recent researches suggest oxidative stress and generalized inflammatory state to be associated with bipolar I disorder (BID). Our aim is to evaluate Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Catalase (CAT) activities in BID. Methods 73 BID patients and 73 healthy controls were enrolled. Patients were classified into manic, depressive and euthymic state. Serum MPO and CAT were measured in both patients and controls. Results CAT activity was significantly lower in controls than manic, depressive and euthymics (p<0.001). MPO activity was significantly higher in controls compared to euthymics (p=0.007) and it was significantly higher in depressives compared to euthymics (p=0.023). CAT was negatively and MPO was positively correlated with disease duration in overall the patients. Positive Predictive Value was 94.5% and Negative Predictive Value was 100% above the cutoff point for CAT activity. Conclusion MPO and CAT activities are impaired in BID, which may be associated with oxidative stress and inflammation.
