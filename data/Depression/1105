Background: Numerous well-established clinical parameters are taken into consideration for the follow-up adaptation of kidney transplant recipients, but there are important disparities between countries, centres and clinicians. Therefore, novel scoring systems have been developed, for instance the Kidney Transplant Failure Score (KTFS) which aims to stratify patients according to their risk of return to dialysis. We hypothesize that the efficiency of the follow-up after one year post-transplantation can be improved by adapting it to the risk of graft failure defined by the KTFS estimation. Methods/design: We propose a phase IV, open label, randomized, multicentric and prospective study. The study is registered with the Clinical Trials Registry NCT01615900. 250 patients will be allocated to one of two arms: the eHealth program versus the standard of care at hospital. In the standard group, patients classified at low-risk (KTFS ≤ 4.17) will be scheduled 4 visits at hospital per year, whilst high-risk patients will visit hospital 6 times. In the eHealth group, patients classified at low-risk will be interviewed 3 times by video conferencing and once at hospital, whilst 6 visits at hospital and 6 video conferencing will be scheduled for high-risk patients. Discussion: The current study allows to scientifically evaluate the etiologic impact of a novel eHealth program. This is important to clarify the possible contribution of telemedicine in the improvement of medical follow-up. The proposed design based on 4 different sub-groups can be interesting to evaluate other personalized medicine programs. © 2015 Foucher et al.; licensee BioMed Central.
