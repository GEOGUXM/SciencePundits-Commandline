NVL (nuclear VCP (valosin containing protein)/p97-Like), a member of the AAA-ATPase (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) family, encodes a novel hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase)-interacting protein NVL2 which is a telomerase component essential for holoenzyme assembly. Previous researches have reported the impacts of telomerase activity on mental illness and the potential association between NVL and major depressive disorder. To validate the susceptibility of NVL to major depressive disorder, and to investigate the overlapping risk conferred by NVL for both major depressive disorder and schizophrenia, we analyzed 9 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tag SNPs) using TaqMan® technology, in 1045 major depressive disorder patients, 1235 schizophrenia patients and 1235 normal controls of Han Chinese origin. We found that rs10916583 (P<inf>allele</inf>=0.020, P<inf>genotype</inf>=0.028, OR=1.156) and rs16846649 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=0.014, P<inf>genotype</inf>=0.007, OR=0.718) were associated with major depressive disorder, while rs10916583 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=1.08E-02, OR=1.213), rs16846649 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=7.40E-06, adjusted P<inf>genotype</inf>=8.07E-05, OR=0.598) and rs10799541 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=8.10E-03, adjusted P<inf>genotype</inf>=0.049, OR=0.826) showed statistically significant association with schizophrenia after Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, rs10916583 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=9.00E-03, adjusted P<inf>genotype</inf>=3.15E-02, OR=1.187) and rs16846649 (adjusted P<inf>allele</inf>=8.92E-06, adjusted P<inf>genotype</inf>=8.84E-05, OR=0.653) remained strongly associated with the analysis of combined cases of major depressive disorder and schizophrenia after Bonferroni correction. Our results indicated that the NVL gene may contain overlapping common genetic risk factors for major depressive disorder and schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population. The roles of NVL in telomerase biogenesis were also highlighted in psychiatric pathogenesis. The study on variants conferring overlapping risk for multiple psychiatric disorders could be tangible pathogenesis support and clinical or diagnostic references. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.
