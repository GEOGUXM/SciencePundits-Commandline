Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established treatment modality for movement disorders. As more behavioral disorders are becoming understood as specific disruptions in neural circuitry, the therapeutic realm of DBS is broadening to encompass a wider range of domains, including disorders of compulsion, affect, and memory, but current understanding of the cellular mechanisms of DBS remains limited. We review progress made during the last decade focusing in particular on how recent methods for targeted circuit manipulations, imaging and reconstruction are fostering preclinical and translational advances that improve our neurobiological understanding of DBS's action in psychiatric disorders.
