Abstract Introduction Although high blood pressure is known to be associated with sexual dysfunction, this phenomenon has been little studied in females and has received little intervention in clinical practice. Objective To identify the presence of sexual dysfunction, considering the different possible domains and to evaluate its relationship with the presence of symptoms of anxiety and depression in women with arterial hypertension. Methodology One hundred fifty seven women (from 56.4 years) with a diagnosis of arterial hypertension were evaluated with media through the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results High rates of sexual dysfunction were detected in the women evaluated, and this dysfunction was in all domains as follows: desire (68.2%), excitement (68.2%), lubrication (41.1%), orgasm (55.4%), satisfaction (66.42%) and pain (56.1%). Elevated rates of symptoms of anxiety (43.3%) and depression (26.8%) were also found in our sample. Nevertheless, in the present study, such symptoms showed no relationship with sexual dysfunction levels for any of the domains assessed. Conclusion Hypertensive patients exhibit an elevated presence of sexual dysfunction, as well as anxious and depressive symptoms. Although the literature on female sexuality indicates influences of these symptoms on sexual functions, this study did not identify such a relationship in the studied population. Sexuality is an important element in patient quality of life, and a broad understanding of female sexual function is fundamental for good follow-up in these patients. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
