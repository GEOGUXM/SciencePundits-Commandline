Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric mood illness and a major cause of disability and suicide worldwide. However, the underlying pathophysiology of MDD remains poorly understood due to its heterogenic nature. Extensive pre-clinical research suggests that many molecular alterations associated with MDD preferentially localize to the postsynaptic density (PSD). Here, we used a rodent chronic mild stress (CMS) model to generate susceptible and unsusceptible subpopulations. Proteomic analysis using an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and tandem mass spectrometry was performed to identify differentially expressed proteins in enriched PSD preparations from the hippocampi of different groups. More than 1500 proteins were identified and quantified, and 74 membrane proteins were differentially expressed. Of these membrane proteins, 51 (69%) were identified by SynaptomeDB search as having a predicted PSD localization. The unbiased profiles identified several PSD candidate proteins that may be related to CMS vulnerability or insusceptibility, and these two CMS phenotypes displayed differences in the abundance of several types of proteins. A detailed protein functional analysis pointed to a role for PSD-associated proteins involved in signaling and regulatory functions. Within the PSD, the N-methyl-. d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NR2A and its downstream targets contribute to CMS susceptibility. Further analysis of disease relevance indicated that the PSD contains a complex set of proteins of known relevance to mental illnesses including depression. In sum, these findings provide novel insights into the contribution of PSD-associated proteins to stress susceptibility and further advance our understanding of the role of hippocampal synaptic plasticity in MDD.
