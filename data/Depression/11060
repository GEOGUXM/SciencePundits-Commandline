Composite biomaterials provide alternative materials that improve on the properties of the individual components and can be used to replace or restore damaged or diseased tissues. Typically, a composite biomaterial consists of a matrix, often a polymer, with one or more fillers that can be made up of particles, sheets or fibres. The polymer matrix can be chosen from a wide range of compositions and can be fabricated easily and rapidly into complex shapes and structures. In the present study we have examined three size fractions of collagen-containing particles embedded at up to 60% w/w in a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix. The particles used were bone particles, which are a mineral-collagen composite and demineralised bone, which gives naturally cross-linked collagen particles. SEM showed well dispersed particles in the PVA matrix for all concentrations and sizes of particles, with FTIR suggesting collagen to PVA hydrogen bonding. T<inf>g</inf> of membranes shifted to a slightly lower temperature with increasing collagen content, along with a minor amount of melting point depression. The modulus and tensile strength of membranes were improved with the addition of both particles up to 10wt%, and were clearly strengthened by the addition, although this effect decreased with higher collagen loadings. Elongation at break decreased with collagen content. Cell adhesion to the membranes was observed associated with the collagen particles, indicating a lack of cytotoxicity. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
