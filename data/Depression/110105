Objective The purpose of this literature database search-based review was to critically consider and evaluate the findings of literature focusing on efficacy and safety of 5-HT3 antagonists in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), so as to test whether preclinical data match clinical therapeutic trials. Design The PubMed database has been searched for papers on 5-HT3 antagonists and OCD in humans and for animal models of OCD and 5-HT3 receptors. Results Of the clinically tested 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, ondansetron has been used to treat OCD in five therapeutic studies, whereas granisetron only in one recent trial. Both showed some efficacy in open studies and superiority to placebo in double-blind studies, along with fair safety. No animal OCD model directly implicated 5-HT3 receptors. Conclusions Overall, results indicate some utility, but the available literature is too scanty to allow for valid conclusions to be drawn. The mismatch between animal models of obsessive-compulsive disorder and clinical data with 5-HT3 antagonists needs more clinical data to ensure that it is not an artefact.
