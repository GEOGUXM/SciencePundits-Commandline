AIMS: To investigate the prevalence of sleep disturbance and psychologic distress in a population of Chinese patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and whether sleep disturbance and psychologic distress are risk indicators for TMD.METHODS: Validated Chinese versions of the Self-Rating Scale of Sleep (SRSS) and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) were used to measure sleep disturbance and psychologic distress of 510 TMD patients with a mean (± SD) age of 31.06 ± 14.40 years. TMD signs/symptoms and sociodemographic data were also collected. The patients were divided into seven diagnostic groups based on the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD). For statistical analysis, the patients were subsequently grouped into those with (n = 128) and without (n = 382) myofascial pain. The data were analyzed using chi-square tests, independent-samples t test, as well as stepwise logistic regression at a significance level of P < .05.RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate to severe sleep disturbance and psychologic distress was significantly higher in the myofascial pain group than in the non-myofascial pain group (P < .05). Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that sleep disturbance and anxiety were possible risk indicators for myofascial pain, with odds ratios of 2.41 and 4.10, respectively (P < .05).CONCLUSION: The Chinese population of TMD patients frequently reported a disturbed sleep condition and psychologic distress symptoms. Sleep disturbance and psychologic distress symptoms are possible risk indicators for myofascial pain in this population.
