The fossiliferous late Early Pleistocene deposits of the Buia Basin (dated to c. 1. Ma) at the Danakil depression, contain three different suid species (. Kolpochoerus olduvaiensis, Kolpochoerus majus, and Metridiochoerus modestus). These suid taxa are morphologically evolved and are found in association with a diverse large vertebrate faunal assemblage, including the genus Homo and a rich accumulation of Acheulean tools. The anatomic, biometric, morphometric and dental microwear analyses, show significant data of dietary traits, habitat and evolutionary changes. In suids, despite their omnivorous diets, microwear study can play a significant role in understanding dietary habits. The results of our study show morphological distinction between the three suid species. Conversely, the microwear patterns recorded on the dental surfaces show overlapping of ecological niches among the species. We believe that their opportunistic feeding and rapid reproduction process might have sustained their survival within the mosaic environments of the Buia Basin in competition with other faunas (other ungulates, carnivores and monkeys) and hominins.
