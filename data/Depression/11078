For two decades, the Niamey area, in Niger, has undergone the creation of several new wadis ("koris" in hausa, the most spoken language in West Africa). The significant runoff increase in the Sahelian reach of Niger river makes us interested in the behavior of the basins of the tributary koris of Niger River in the Niamey area, in Niger. These koris generally formed during a single storm event, within depressions previously occupied by ponds; these ponds are overflown creating a new "kori". This study examines in detail the causes of this new exorheism mechanism. The main explanation of this evolution has been determined as being the strong runoff increase, related to an extension of crusted soils due to agricultural practices, mostly the reduction of fallow duration. The degradation of their structural stability leads to crusting and a strong reduction of their hydraulic conductivity. This is linked to water and sediment balance at the catchment scale.
