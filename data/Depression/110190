Background Antenatal depression (AD) can have devastating consequences. No existing scales are specifically designed to measure it. Common practice is to adapt scales originally developed for other circumstances. We designed this study to validate and determine the psychometric values for AD screening in Brazil. Methods We collected clinical and socio-demographic data in the second gestational trimester. The following instruments were also administered during that period: MINI-PLUS, EPDS, BDI and HAM-D. Results At the time of assessment, 17.34% of the patients were depressed, and 31.98% met the diagnostic criteria for lifetime major depression. All instruments showed an area under the curve in a receiver operating characteristic analysis greater than 0.85, with the BDI achieving a 0.90 and being the best-performing screening instrument. A score ≥11 on the EPDS (81.58% sensitivity, 73.33% specificity), ≥15 on the BDI (82.00% sensitivity, 84.26% specificity) and ≥9 on the HAM-D (87.76% sensitivity, 74.60% specificity) revealed great dichotomy between depressed and non-depressed patients. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (ρ) among the scales had good values (EPDS vs. BDI 0.79; BDI vs. HAM-D 0.70, and EPDS vs. HAM-D 0.67). Limitations This study was transversal, assessing only women in the second gestational trimester. Results may be applicable only to the Brazilian population since psychometric properties may vary with the population under study. Major depression can amplify somatic symptomatology, affecting depressive rating scale data. Conclusion AD is highly prevalent in Brazil. To address the problem of under-recognition, physicians can use the EPDS, BDI and HAM-D to identify AD. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
