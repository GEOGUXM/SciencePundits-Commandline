Presynaptic kainate-type glutamate ionotropic receptors (KARs) that mediate either the depression or the facilitation of GABA release have been intensively studied. Little attention has been given to the modulation of GABA<inf>A</inf> receptors (GABA<inf>A</inf>Rs) by postsynaptic KARs. Recent studies suggest that two GABA<inf>A</inf>R populations, synaptic (sGABA<inf>A</inf>R) and extrasynaptic (eGABA<inf>A</inf>R) GABA<inf>A</inf>Rs, mediate phasic and tonic forms of inhibition, respectively. Tonic inhibition plays an important role in the excitability of neuronal circuits and the occurrence of epileptic seizures. For this study, we are the first to report that the activation of postsynaptic KARs by the KAR agonist, Kainic acid (KA, 5μM), enhanced tonic inhibition by potentiating eGABA<inf>A</inf>Rs. KA enhanced THIP-induced eGABA<inf>A</inf>R currents and prolonged the rise and decay time of muscimol-induced sGABA<inf>A</inf>R/eGABA<inf>A</inf>R currents, but also depressed the amplitude of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), unitary IPSCs (uIPSCs), and muscimol-induced sGABA<inf>A</inf>R/eGABA<inf>A</inf>R currents. The PKC inhibitor, staurosporine (1μM), in the patch pipette solution fully blocked the KA-induced potentiation of tonic inhibition, suggesting the involvement of an intracellular PKC pathway. Our study suggests that the activation of postsynaptic KARs potentiates eGABA<inf>A</inf>Rs but depresses sGABA<inf>A</inf>Rs. By activating postsynaptic KARs, synaptically released glutamate depresses phasic inhibition to facilitate neuronal plasticity, but potentiates tonic inhibition to protect neurons from over-excitation. © 2015 IBRO.
