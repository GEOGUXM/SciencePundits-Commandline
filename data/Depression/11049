Memory biases, that is, general memory impairments as well as specific mood-congruent memory biases, are important vulnerability factors in depression. Recently, computerized memory trainings have been developed to target these biases, reducing rumination and lightening depressive symptoms. This review presents three novel treatment approaches: general memory training, emotional memory training, and attention or interpretation training targeting memory processes. Results are mixed, but the computerized memory trainings that target general deficits in memory or specific emotional biases seem to be an interesting new treatment option, especially as add-ons to other interventions. However, many open questions remain. These include the mechanisms of these trainings as well as more practical aspects like the optimal number of sessions, the duration of the effects, and individual differences in trainability.
