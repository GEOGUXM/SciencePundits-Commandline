Objective: The aim was to explore the association between handedness and noise sensitivity, with possible implications on the occurrence of high perceived anxiety and depression in young healthy adults. Methods: A cross-sectional study comprised 1113 persons, 400 men and 713 women, aged 21.44. ±. 2.11. years. According to Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, participants were classified as: strongly left-handed, weakly left-handed, weakly right-handed, and strongly right-handed. Noise sensitivity was measured with Weinstein's scale. Perceived anxiety and depression were measured using Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, respectively. Results: Noise sensitivity depends on one's age. Noise sensitivity increased the odds of high perceived anxiety (Odds Ratio. =. 1.031; 95% Confidence Interval. =. 1.023-1.034) and depression (OR. =. 1.030; 95% CI. =. 1.022-1.038), independently from age, gender and handedness. Being weakly right-handed and weakly left-handed was associated with higher odds of depression in comparison to being strongly right-handed. Conclusions: Noise sensitive persons were at higher risk of high perceived anxiety and depression. Weakly right-handed and weakly left-handed persons were at higher risk of depression, independently from noise sensitivity. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
