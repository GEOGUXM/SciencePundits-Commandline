Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of highly conserved zinc-dependent proteases involved in both development and pathogenesis. The present study examines the role of MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B) in adult neurogenesis, using the corpus cerebelli, a subdivision of the cerebellum, of knifefish (Apteronotus leptorhynchus) as a model system. Transcripts of five isoforms of these gelatinases were identified in the central nervous system of this species. Sequence similarity analysis and homology modeling indicated that functionally and structurally critical elements were highly conserved in knifefish gelatinases. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a differential distribution of MMP-2 and MMP-9 at both the cellular and subcellular level. MMP-2 expression was found mainly in Sox2-immunopositive stem/progenitor cells, both quiescent and mitotically active; and was localized in both the cytoplasmic compartment and the nucleus. By contrast, MMP-9 immunoreactivity was absent in neurogenic niches and displayed a more homogenous distribution, with low to moderate intensity levels, in the molecular and granular layers. MMP-9 expression appeared to be restricted to the extracellular space. In situ zymography indicated that gelatinase activity matched the cellular and subcellular distributions of the two MMPs. The observed patterns of gelatinase activity and expression support the hypothesis that MMP-2 is primarily involved in regulation of the activity of stem/progenitor cells that give rise to new granule neurons, whereas MMP-9 facilitates migration of the progeny of these cells by proteolysis of extracellular matrix proteins.
