Platelet aggregation at sites of vascular injury is essential for hemostasis but also thrombosis. Platelet adhesiveness is critically dependent on agonist-induced inside-out activation of heterodimeric integrin receptors by amechanisminvolving the recruitment of talin-1 to the cytoplasmic integrin tail. Experiments in heterologous cells have suggested a critical role of Rap1-guanosine triphosphate-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) for talin-1 recruitment and thus integrin activation, but direct in vivo evidence to support this has been missing. We generated RIAM-null mice and found that they are viable, fertile, and apparently healthy. Unexpectedly, platelets from these mice show unaltered b3- and b1-integrin activation and consequently normal adhesion and aggregation responses under static andflowconditions.Similarly,hemostasis andarterial thrombus formationwere indistinguishable between wild-type and RIAM-nullmice. These results reveal that RIAMis dispensable for integrin activation and function in mouse platelets, strongly suggesting the existence of alternative mechanisms of talin-1 recruitment.
