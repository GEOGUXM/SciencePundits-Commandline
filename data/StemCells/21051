Motor neurons send out axons to peripheral muscles while their cell bodies remain in the ventral spinal cord. The unique configuration of motor neurons spanning the border between the CNS and PNS has been explained by structural barriers such as boundary cap (BC) cells, basal lamina and radial glia. However, mechanisms in motor neurons that retain their position have not been addressed yet. Here we demonstrate that the Islet1 (Isl1) and Islet2 (Isl2) transcription factors, which are essential for acquisition of motor neuron identity, also contribute to restrict motor neurons within the neural tube. In mice that lack both Isl1 and Isl2, large numbers of motor neurons exited the neural tube, even prior to the appearance of BC cells at the ventral exit points. Transcriptional profiling of motor neurons derived from Isl1 null embryonic stem cells revealed that transcripts of major genes involved in repulsive mechanisms were misregulated. Particularly, expression of Neuropilin1 (Npr1) and Slit2 mRNA was diminished in Islet mutant mice, and these could be target genes of the Islet proteins. Consistent with this mechanism, Robo and Slit mutations in mice and knockdown of Npr1 and Slit2 in chick embryos caused motor neurons to migrate to the periphery. Together, our study suggests that Islet genes engage Robo-Slit and Neuropilin-Semaphorin signaling in motor neurons to retain motor somata within the CNS. Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.
