Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) causes progressive motor neuron degeneration, paralysis and death by ventilatory failure. In rodent ALS models: 1) breathing capacity is preserved until late in disease progression despite major respiratory motor neuron death, suggesting unknown forms of compensatory respiratory plasticity; and 2) spinal microglia become activated in association with motor neuron cell death. Here, we report a novel experimental model to study the impact of respiratory motor neuron death on compensatory responses without many complications attendant to spontaneous motor neuron disease. In specific, we used intrapleural injections of cholera toxin B fragment conjugated to saporin (CTB. -SAP) to selectively kill motor neurons with access to the pleural space. Motor neuron survival, CD11b labeling (microglia), ventilatory capacity and phrenic motor output were assessed in rats 3-28. days after intrapleural injections of: 1) CTB-SAP (25 and 50. μg), or 2) unconjugated CTB and SAP (i.e. control; (CTB. +. SAP). CTB-SAP elicited dose-dependent phrenic and intercostal motor neuron death; 7. days post-25. μg CTB-SAP, motor neuron survival approximated that in end-stage ALS rats (phrenic: 36 ± 7%; intercostal: 56 ± 10% of controls; n = 9; p. <. 0.05). CTB-SAP caused minimal cell death in other brainstem or spinal cord regions. CTB-SAP: 1) increased CD11b fractional area in the phrenic motor nucleus, indicating microglial activation; 2) decreased breathing during maximal chemoreceptor stimulation; and 3) diminished phrenic motor output in anesthetized rats (7. days post-25 μg, CTB-SAP: 0.3 ± 0.07. V; CTB + SAP: 1.5 ± 0.3; n = 9; p < 0.05). Intrapleural CTB-SAP represents a novel, inducible model of respiratory motor neuron death and provides an opportunity to study compensation for respiratory motor neuron loss. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.
