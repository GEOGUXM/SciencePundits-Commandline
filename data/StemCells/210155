Norovirus gastroenteritis (NV-GE) is a highly transmittable disease that can lead to fatal outcomes in vulnerable populations including patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Prompt detection of NV is therefore important for HSCT recipients. Immunochromatography (IC) can be used to easily and rapidly diagnose NV-GE by detecting NV antigens. In this study, we examined 642 stool specimens in patients who developed diarrhea after allogeneic HSCT between January 2007 and June 2011. NV was detected in 10 of 350 (2.9 %) HSCT recipients. The median onset of symptoms was 36 days (range 3–93) after HSCT. The median duration of symptoms was 42 days (3–135). A second or subsequent allogeneic HSCT was associated with a higher incidence of NV-GE (P = 0.034). Of four patients who underwent colonoscopy, two showed intestinal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) histopathology, whereas the other two showed no evidence of GVHD, and thus no need for intensified immunosuppression. None of the patients died of NV-GE. In conclusion, IC may be useful in the differential diagnosis of diarrhea after allogeneic HSCT, and could enable the appropriate adjustment of immunosuppressive drugs and prompt preventive measures. © 2015 The Japanese Society of Hematology
