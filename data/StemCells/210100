Abstract Aims: Osteosarcoma is the most common pediatric bone malignancy with high propensity to metastasize and relapse. Emerging evidence suggest that osteosarcoma is sustained by a subset of self-renewing cancer stemlike cells (CSCs) relying on mechanisms to evade apoptosis and survive in response to drugs-induced DNA damage. We proposed to decipher the mechanisms underlying the resistance of CSCs to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Mainmethods: CSCs were isolated using a sphere-forming assay and tested for sensitivity to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, using MTT cell viability and BrdU proliferation assays, TUNEL staining and caspases 3/7 activity. Bcl-2 family proteins were analyzed by Western blot. Doxorubicin uptakewas determined by confocal microscopy and bioluminescence imaging. Key findings: We showed that osteosarcoma sphere stem-like cells expressed the multidrug-related efflux transporters P-glycoprotein and BCRP and are highly resistant to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Conversely after exposure to doxorubicin, these cells displayed an up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xLwith concomitant down-regulation of Bak and decreased caspase 3/7 activity. Inhibition of drug efflux transporters enhanced the cellular uptake of doxorubicin, being encompassed by an up-regulation the pro-apoptotic protein Bak and suppression of Bcl-2, favoring the commitment of CSCs towards apoptosis. Significance: These results seemingly suggest that the high apoptotic threshold of CSCs to doxorubicin-induced cell dead stimuli is mainly dependent on the drug concentration reaching tumor cells that are governed by efflux transporter activity. Therefore, modulation of these transporters may be effective in potentiating the proapoptotic effects of doxorubicin, and emerges as an attractive strategy to sensitize osteosarcoma CSCs to chemotherapy.
