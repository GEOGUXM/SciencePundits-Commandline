The management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in accelerated or blast phase (advanced phase) remains a significant challenge despite the introduction of very effective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The biology of advanced-phase CML is complex and engages several pathways that are not optimally targeted by TKIs. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only potentially curative therapy, but the effectiveness of this conventional approach is limited. New strategies are required to improve the outlook for these patients. Â© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
