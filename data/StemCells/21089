Advances in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in providing an effective and curative measure for many malignancies have led to further associated complications. Stem cell transplant (SCT) survivors are at increased risk for developing late complications secondary to pre-, peri-, and posttransplantation exposures. There is a lack of knowledge in prevention, treatment, and long-term outcomes associated with the different organ systems affected. We will present urological complications post SCT with the associated risk factors, preventative measures, treatments, and outcomes. Due to the high morbidity and mortality associated with post SCT urological complications, future prospective studies are needed. Â© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.
