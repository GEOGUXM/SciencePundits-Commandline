Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway can regulate inflammatory and immune responses. N-trans-feruloyltyramine (FLA) is an active phenylpropanoid compound. It possesses antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-melanogenesis, and anticancer activities. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying FLA modulation of cytokine expression in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages have not been fully investigated. In this study, we examined the mechanisms underlying the immunomodulative effects of FLA isolated from Arcangelisia gusanlung. FLA strongly suppressed mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), but not tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, thereby inhibiting the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E<inf>2</inf> (PGE<inf>2</inf>) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, FLA also inhibited nuclear translocation of activation protein (AP)-1, and simultaneously decreased the expression and phosphorylation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) protein. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of FLA might be attributed to downregulation of COX-2 and iNOS via suppression of AP-1 and the JNK signalling pathway in RAW 264.7 macrophages. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
