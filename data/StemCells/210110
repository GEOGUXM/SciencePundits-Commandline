Specific vehicles are necessary for safe and efficient gene transfection into cells. Nano-type hydrogels (nanogel) comprising carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) complexed with branched type cationic poly(ethleneimine) (bPEI) were used as gene delivery vehicles. When complexes of CMC and bPEI were used in vitro, CMC showed nano-gel type properties, as shown by the results of a viscosity test, and bPEI showed low cytotoxicity comparing to bPEI alone. Together, these properties are shown to maintain high gene transfection efficiency. In viability experiments using three types of adult stem cells, cell viability varied depending on the branch form of PEI and whether or not it is in a complex with CMC. The gene delivery efficacy showed that the CMC nanogel complexed with bPEI (CMC-bPEI) showed more uptaking and gene transfection ability in hMSCs comparing to bPEI alone. In osteogenesis, the CMC-bPEI complexed with OSX pDNA showed more easy internalization than bPEI alone complexed with OSX pDNA in hMSCs. Specific genes and proteins related in osteogenic differentiation were expressed in hMSCs when the CMC-bPEI complexed with OSX pDNA was used. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
