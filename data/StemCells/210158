Skeletal muscle regeneration is a well-characterized biological process in which resident adult stem cells must undertake a series of cell-fate decisions to ensure efficient repair of the damaged muscle fibers while also maintaining the stem cell niche. Satellite cells, the main stem cell contributing to the repaired muscle fiber, are maintained in a quiescent state in healthy muscle. Upon injury, the satellite cells become activated, and proliferate to expand the muscle progenitor cell population before returning to the quiescent state or differentiating to become myofibers. Importantly, the determination of cell fate is controlled at the epigenetic level in response to environmental cues. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the role played by noncoding RNAs (both miRNAs and long-noncoding RNAs) in the epigenetic control of muscle regeneration. Muscle regeneration is mediated by satellite cells, a population of stem cells that must undertake a cell fate decision to either repair damaged muscle fibers or self-renew to maintain the satellite cell niche. This determination of cell fate is controlled at the epigenetic level. Here, we discuss the role played by noncoding RNAs in the epigenetic control of muscle regeneration. Â© 2014 FEBS.
