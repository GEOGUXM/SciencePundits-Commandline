Poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA) films known for their resistance to nonspecific protein adsorption, cell/bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation were produced by surface initiated polymerization on a silicon surface via a batch reaction system in CO2 expanded liquid (CO2-EL) medium. Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) was carried out using 2,2'-bipyridyl as ligand and CuBr as a catalyst in water/methanol mixture with trichloro[4-(chloromethyl)phenyl]silane (CMPS) used as the initiating species. The films were grown in the CO2-EL environment at a range of conditions and thickness up to 10nm. In contrast to films produced by conventional solvent systems at atmospheric pressure, the polymer films grown by the CO2-EL process showed uniform thickness and pin-hole free topography. Most importantly, the CO2-EL processed PSBMA films showed no trace of copper (used as the catalyst), thus obviating the need for post-deposition processing and avoiding adverse effects of the metal leaching during service. Finally, PSBMA films from both the conventional and CO2-EL processes were exposed to Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and the results showed that, while in both the cases the cell proliferation rate was inhibited by the charged polymeric brush surface, the CO2-EL-processed brush exhibited inhibition to a larger extent due to the reduced occurrence of pinholes. The process can be easily exploited effectively when carrying out surface initiated polymerization on non-flat topographies, such as in trenches and nanostructured features with high aspect ratios.
