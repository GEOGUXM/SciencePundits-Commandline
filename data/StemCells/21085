Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a known risk factor for invasive aspergillosis (IA), but remains poorly studied in relation to Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). We report a case of a 58-years-old patient who developed an IA within a protected room, CDI and GVHD after allogeneic allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Factors associated with this complex condition in patients receiving allogeneic PBSCT need to be identified. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
