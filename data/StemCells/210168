Currently available markers routinely used in clinical practice are of limited value to patients with estrogen receptor-negative (ER−) breast cancer [basal-like and HER2neu-positive (HER+)], an aggressive subtype. Our aim was to uncover molecular pathways and signaling networks exposed by differentially methylated genes informative of the biology of ER− breast cancer (BC) subtypes versus ER-positive (ER+). Whole-genome methylation array analysis was carried out using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip on 14 primary BC: five ER+, four triple-negative (TNBC), and five ER−HER2+. Degree of methylation was calculated as a β-value (ranging from 0 to 1), and M-values [log (β/(1 − β)] were used for significance tests. To identify methylated genes associated with ER− subtypes (TNBC and ER−HER2+) and distinct from ER+, a weighted algorithm, developed to increase statistical rigor, called out genes in which methylation changed dramatically between ER+ and ER− subtypes. Differentially methylated gene lists examined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis called out canonical pathways and networks with clues to biological distinctiveness as well as relatedness between ER− subtypes as compared to ER+ BC. The study highlights the interplay of ER− subtype-specific genes and their signaling pathways as potential putative fingerprints in refining classification of BC subtypes and as potential biological markers designed to hit multiple targets. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.
