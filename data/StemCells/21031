Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) recruits adult stem/progenitor cells via its specific receptor, C-X-C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4), to promote heart, kidney and tendon regeneration, but little is known about the effects of SDF-1 on bone regeneration in periodontal diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate whether local administration of SDF-1 in a collagen membrane scaffold enhanced the recruitment of host stem cells and improved periodontal bone defect repair. To this end, bone defects were established on the buccal side of bilateral mandibles in Wistar rats. After application of collagen membranes loaded with SDF-1 or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to the defects, the effects of SDF-1 on stem cell recruitment, inflammatory cell responses, angiogenesis, osteoclastogenesis, scaffold degradation, and bone regeneration were evaluated. It showed that SDF-1 recruited host-derived mesenchymal stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells to the wound area and significantly reduced the CD11b + inflammatory cell response. Moreover, SDF-1 increased vascular formation, induced early bone osteoclastogenesis, accelerated scaffold degradation, and promoted the quality and quantity of regenerated bone. Our results suggest that this cell-free approach by local administration of SDF-1 may be an effective strategy for development as a simple and safe technique for periodontal bone regeneration.
