The infusion of donor lymphocytes expressing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase suicide gene (TK-cells) is a promising strategy for the treatment of hematologic malignancies relapsing after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Here we report the results of a phase I clinical trial designed to examine the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) of TK-cells. Three patients (two with malignant lymphomas, one with acute myeloid leukemia) were enrolled in the trial and received a single DLI of 1 × 107 or 5 × 107 TK-cells/kg. No local or systemic toxicity related to the gene-transfer procedure was observed. Two patients achieved stable disease. No patient had severe graft-versus-host disease requiring systemic steroid and/or ganciclovir administration. TK-cells were detected in the peripheral blood of all three patients by PCR, but did not persist longer than 28 days. Analysis of cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity detected no immune response against TK-cells by the recipient’s own T cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed low proliferative activity and cytotoxic function of TK-cells. In conclusion, DLI of TK-cells was safely performed in all three patients. Our analysis suggests the probable cause of rapid disappearance of TK-cells to be insufficient in vivo expansion of TK-cells in these patients. © 2015 The Japanese Society of Hematology
