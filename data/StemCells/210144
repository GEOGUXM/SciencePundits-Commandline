Total hip and knee arthroplasty have being successfully performed in world-wide in recent years. However, poor osseointegration between implant (polish surface) and host bone tissue is one of the main causes for aseptic loosening in Ti-based materials and result in failure. Fabricating nanotopography is a promising method to improve cell behaviors and promote osseointegration. Ti nanorods array of vary lengths have been produced via selective corrosion of Ti substrate using electrochemical anodization technique on titanium surface. In this study, we investigated the murine bone mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) behaviors in response to these different lengths of nanorods. The result showed that the nanorod of 100 nm length increased MSCs adhesion and proliferation. Increased elongation of cytoskeleton actin was also observed on 100 nm height, which resulted in substantially up-regulation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, suggesting greater bone-forming ability than control Ti. The Ti nanorods of 100 nm length may be a promising implant surface to improve the osseointegration. Â© 2015 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved Printed in the United States of America.
