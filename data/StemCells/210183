Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease for which the standard treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy has remained largely unchanged for over four decades, with unfavorable clinical results. Epigenetic alterations have been described in several AMLs, and in some cases their origin has been studied in detail mechanistically (such as in acute promyelocytic leukemia, caused by the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor-α fusion protein). Recently, the advent of massive parallel sequencing has revealed that > 70% of AML cases have mutations in DNA methylation-related genes or mutations in histone modifiers, showing that epigenetic alterations are key players in the development of most, if not all, AMLs, and pointing to the exploitation of new molecular targets for more efficacious therapies. This review provides a brief overview of the latest findings on the characterization of the epigenetic landscape of AML and discusses the rationale for the optimization of epigenetic therapy of AML. Acute myeloid Leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults. Mutations in epigenetic modifiers are emerging as a large class of mutations critical for AML development. This review gives a brief overview on the latest findings on the characterization of the epigenetic landscape in AML and the rational for the optimization of epigenetic therapy. © 2014 FEBS.
