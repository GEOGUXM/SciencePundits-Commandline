Fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (. Fndc5) has already been distinguished to be involved in neural differentiation. However, cellular events of Fndc5 function are still ambiguous in the nervous system. One approach to shed light on duty of this protein in the nervous system is to find its cross-talks with various signaling pathways with defined characteristics and roles. Identification of the underlying molecular mechanism which controls Fndc5 expression and switches its activity up and down enables us to find out the Fndc5 functional map in the nervous system and other human body systems. Retinoic acid (RA) is a bio-small molecule which exerts its role as a neural inducer in the neurodevelopmental process of neural tube. RA up-regulates the expression of various genes involved in neural differentiation process via two distinct pathways: the genomic and the non-genomic. Our previous study has revealed that RA induces Fndc5 expression during neural differentiation process. In this study we have evaluated our hypothesis about the non-genomic up regulation of Fndc5 expression by RA. Interestingly we have identified that there is an association between ERK signaling pathway and Fndc5 expression. Furthermore, inhibition of this pathway by PD0325901 dramatically reduced Fndc5 mRNA level, while activating the pathway up-regulated Fndc5 transcription. In addition, it has been proven that ERK1/2 modulation via RA has more significant controlling effect on Fndc5 promoter rather than bFGF. This led us to conclude that RA enhances Fndc5 expression through a non-genomic pathway via the ERK signaling pathway. Â© 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
