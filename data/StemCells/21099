Implants that can inhibit osteoclastogenesis and enhance osteogenesis are desirable for osteoporosis patients. In this study, titania nanotube (Ti-NT) materials, having nanotube diameters of 30, 80, and 120 nm, were produced separately by anodization at 10, 40, and 60 V, respectively. The introduction of Ti-NTs to titanium substrates significantly reduced the formation and activity of osteoclasts on samples. With the enlargement of the nanotube diameter, the osteoclasts number, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and activity, and related gene expressions of osteoclasts were further reduced. Osteogenic ability was enhanced by increasing the nanotube diameter. Thus, larger-diameter nanotube implants, such as NT60, were better able to inhibit bone absorption and enhance bone formation to prevent implant loss and failure, especially for osteoporosis patients.
