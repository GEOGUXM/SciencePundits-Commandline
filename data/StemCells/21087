Risk factors for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HCST) include: HLA mismatches, sex-mismatch, and stem-cell source. We retrospectively analyzed if HLA- and sex-mismatching quantitatively affects the composition of GVHD-induced T-cell infiltrates. We quantified absolute numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells present in tissue sections from skin biopsies of 23 pediatric HSCT-recipients with GVHD. HSCT with a sex-mismatched unrelated donor was associated with an increased number of CD4+ T cells when compared to a sex-matched unrelated donor (. p=. 0.01). The absolute numbers of skin-infiltrating T cells were increased in patients expressing T-cell epitopes derived from the recipient's mismatched HLA, so called predicted indirectly recognizable HLA epitopes (PIRCHE). The combined expression of PIRCHE with a sex-mismatch resulted in the highest number of skin-infiltrating T cells. Our results indicate that an increased number of recipient-specific T-cell epitopes is associated with accumulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the skin. Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.
