Background Expansion of adipose tissue is dependent on adipogenesis, angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling. A functional role in these processes was suggested for the gelatinase subfamily of the matrix metalloproteinases. Here, we have evaluated a potential role of gelatinase A (MMP-2) in adipogenesis. Methods Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were derived from wild-type or MMP-2 deficient mice. Genetic manipulation of Mmp2 (shRNA-knockdown or overexpression) was performed in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes. Cell cultures were subjected to an adipogenic medium. As an in vivo model for de novo adipogenesis, 3T3-F442A preadipocytes with or without knockdown were injected subcutaneously in Nude BALB/c mice kept on high fat diet. Results Mmp2 deficient MEF, as compared to controls, showed significantly impaired differentiation into mature adipocytes, as demonstrated by 90% reduced intracellular lipid content and reduced expression of pro-adipogenic markers. Moreover, selective Mmp2 knockdown in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes resulted in significantly reduced differentiation. In contrast, overexpression of Mmp2 resulted in markedly enhanced differentiation. In de novo formed fat pads resulting from preadipocytes with Mmp2 knockdown expression of aP2, Ppar-γ and adiponectin was significantly lower, and collagen was more preserved. The fat pad weights as well as size and density of adipocytes or blood vessels were, however, not significantly different from controls. Conclusion Our data directly support a functional role of MMP-2 in adipogenesis in vitro, and suggest a potential role in in vivo adipogenesis. General significance Selective modulation of MMP-2 levels affects adipogenesis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
