Early lead compounds in this gamma secretase modulator series were found to potently inhibit CYP3A4 and other human CYP isoforms increasing their risk of causing drug-drug-interactions (DDIs). Using structure-activity relationships and CYP3A4 structural information, analogs were developed that minimized this DDI potential. Three of these new analogs were further characterized by rat PK, rat PK/PD and rat exploratory toxicity studies resulting in selection of SPI-1865 (14) as a preclinical development candidate.
