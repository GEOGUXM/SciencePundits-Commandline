The clearance of overloaded amyloid-β (Aβ) species, especially the toxic aggregates, was thought to be an attractive and promising strategy for Alzheimers disease (AD) therapy in the past decade. In this work, an active Aβ inhibitor decapeptide RR was used to transform mature Aβ fibrils (fAβ) into nanorod-like Aβ assemblies (rAβ) as well as loosen the β-structure of rAβ. Compared with fAβ, rAβ could be engulfed by PC12 cells more efficiently and showed a 1.46-fold difference. More importantly, the rAβ was colocated with lysosomes after endocytosis, and in vitro study illustrated that rAβ were easily degraded by lysosome protease cathepsin B when compared with the fibrils. Thus, our study indicated the potential application of RR in Aβ fibrils clearance by a cell-participated and enzyme-mediated pathway. © 2015 American Chemical Society.
