Copper (Cu)-amyloid β (Aβ) interactions play a role in the etiology of Alzheimers disease. This work presents a spectroscopic and electrochemical study of two physiologically relevant Aβ-CuII complexes, as a function of pH and relative Cu-Aβ(1-16) concentrations. Our results reveal that these coordination modes display distinct redox behaviors and provide experimental evidence for the existence of an intermediate CuI species. A mechanism for the redox cycling of these complexes is proposed, providing further insight into the redox relevance of Aβ-Cu interactions. © 2014 American Chemical Society.
