Both enantiomers of the epibatidine analogue flubatine display high affinity towards the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in vitro, accompanied by negligible interactions with diverse off-target proteins. Extended single dose toxicity studies in rodent indicated a NOEL (No Observed Effect Level) of 6.2 μg/kg for (-)-flubatine and 1.55 μg/kg for (+)-flubatine. We developed syntheses for both flubatine enantiomers and their corresponding precursors for radiolabeling. The newly synthesized trimethylammonium precursors allowed for highly efficient 18F- radiolabelling in radiochemical yields &gt;60% and specific activities &gt;750 GBq/μmol, thus making the radioligands practical for clinical investigation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
