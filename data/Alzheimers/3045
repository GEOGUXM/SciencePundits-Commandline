We previously demonstrated that, in the early stages of tau processing inAlzheimer's disease, the N-terminal part of the molecule undergoes acharacteristic cascade of phosphorylation and progressive misfolding of theproteins resulting in a structural conformation detected by Alz-50. In thisimmunohistochemical study of AD brain tissue, we have found that C-terminaltruncation of tau at Asp-421 was an early event in tau aggregation and analyzedthe relationship between phospho-dependent tau epitopes located at the Cterminuswith truncation at Glu-391. The aim of this study was to determinewhether C-terminal truncation may trigger events leading to the assembly ofinsoluble PHFs from soluble tau aggregates present in pre-tangle cells. Ourfindings suggest that there is a complex interaction between phosphorylatedand truncated tau species. A model is presented here in which truncated tauprotein represents an early neurotoxic species while phosphorylated tauspecies may provide a neuroprotective role in Alzheimer's disease. © 2015 Flores-rodríguez, Ontiveros-torres, Cárdenas-aguayo, Luna-arias, Meraz-ríos, Viramontes-pintos, Harrington, M_wischik, Florán, Mena and Luna-muñoz.
