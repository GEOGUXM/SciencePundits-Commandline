Baseline data are summarized from a study examining the psychometric properties of the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) and its subtests, and correlating the NTB with other cognitive and functional assessments. A multicenter, longitudinal, non-interventional study included mild to moderate Alzheimers disease (AD, n = 196), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 70), or normal cognition participants (NC, n = 75). The NTB, other cognitive assessment tools, functional/behavioral questionnaires, and health outcome assessments were administered. At baseline composite NTB, NTB memory, and NTB executive function z-scores were significantly lower for participants with AD compared with MCI, and for participants with MCI compared with NC. The composite NTB z-score had high test-retest reliability between screening and baseline. The results of this study suggest that NTB exhibits good reliability in patients with mild to moderate AD and MCI. Â© 2014 Taylor & Francis.
