Advanced materials are attracting strong interest in the fundamental as well as applied sciences and are being extensively explored for their potential usage in a range of healthcare technological and biological applications. Advanced Healthcare Nanomaterials summarises the current status of knowledge in the fields of advanced materials for functional therapeutics, point-of-care diagnostics, translational materials, up and coming bio-engineering devices. The book highlights the key features which enable engineers to design stimuli-responsive smart nanoparticles, novel biomaterials, nano/micro-devices for diagnosis, therapy (theranostics).The leading contributor researchers cover the following topics: • State-of-the-art of biomaterials for human health • Micro- and nanoparticles and their application in biosensors • The role of immunoassays • Stimuli-responsive smart nanoparticles • Diagnosis and treatment of cancer • Advanced materials for biomedical application and drug delivery • Nanoparticles for diagnosis and/or treatment of Alzheimers disease • Hierarchical modelling of elastic behavior of human dental tissue • Biodegradable porous hydrogels • Hydrogels in tissue engineering, drug delivery and wound care • Modified natural zeolites • Supramolecular hydrogels based on cyclodextrin poly(pseudo)rotaxane • Polyhydroxyalkanoate-based biomaterials • Biomimetic molecularly imprinted polymers The book is written for readers from diverse backgrounds across chemistry, physics, materials science and engineering, medical science, pharmacy, biotechnology, and biomedical engineering. It offers a comprehensive view of cutting-edge research on advanced materials for healthcare technology and applications. © 2014 by Scrivener Publishing LLC. All rights reserved.
