The objective of this study is to evaluate the Acetyl Cholinesterase and β-Secretase inhibitory activity of designed flavone-fused-thiazole analogues using insilico docking studies. Insilico docking studies were carried out using Schrodinger software based on GLIDE (Grid-based Ligand Docking with Energetics). Acetyl Cholinesterase inhibitors, including Donepezil, Tacrine, Galantamine and Rivastigamine are being used currently in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and used as standards in the present study. The docking scores of flavone-fused-thiazole analogues were varied between -0.16 and -7.5 against Acetyl Cholinesterase and -1.6 and -9.3 for β-Secretase. Test compound (PS206) 1-(2-oxobutyl)-3-(5-(3, 6, 7-trihydroxy-5, 8- dimethoxy-4-oxo-4H-chromen-2-yl) benzo[d] thiazol-2-yl) urea was found to be more significant when compared with the standard docking score. These molecular docking analyses could lead to the further development of potent inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Further investigations on the above compounds are necessary to develop potential chemical entities for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. © 2014, International Journal of PharmTech Research.
