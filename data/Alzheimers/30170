Aim:To investigate whether atorvastatin treatment could prevent Aβ 1-42 oligomer (AβO)-induced synaptotoxicity and memory dysfunction in rats, and to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective actions of atorvastatin.Methods:SD rats were injected with AβOs (5 nmol, icv). The rats were administrated with atorvastatin (10 mg·kg -1 ·d -1, po) for 2 consecutive weeks (the first dose was given 5 d before AβOs injection). The memory impairments were evaluated with Morris water maze task. The expression of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus was determined using ELISA assays. The levels of PSD-95 and p38MAPK proteins in rat hippocampus were evaluated using Western blot analysis. For in vitro experiments, cultured rat hippocampal neurons were treated with AβOs (50 nmol/L) for 48 h. The expression of MAP-2 and synaptophysin in the neurons was detected with immunofluorescence.Results:The AβO-treated rats displayed severe memory impairments in Morris water maze tests, and markedly reduced levels of synaptic proteins synaptophysin and PSD-95, increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-) and p38MAPK activation in the hippocampus. All these effects were prevented or substantially attenuated by atorvastatin administration. Pretreatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with atorvastatin (1 and 5 μmol/L) concentration-dependently attenuated the AβO-induced synaptotoxicity, including the loss of dendritic marker MAP-2, and synaptic proteins synaptophysin and PSD-95. Pretreatment of the cultured hippocampal neurons with the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (5 μmol/L) blocked the AβO-induced loss of synaptophysin and PSD-95.Conclusion:Atorvastatin prevents AβO-induced synaptotoxicity and memory dysfunction through a p38MAPK-dependent pathway. © 2014 CPS and SIMM All rights reserved.
