Background: To assess the relationship between regional neocortical atrophy and psychotic symptoms in adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD). Methods: Rates of change in regional neocortical atrophy as measured by longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging scans and the occurrence of psychotic symptoms and/or the long-term use of antipsychotic medications in 389 outpatients with MCI or AD in Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Results: Atrophy rate of 3 specific neocortical regions, lateral frontal, lateral parietal, and anterior cingulate gyrus, was significantly associated with the onset of psychosis including delusions, agitation, wandering, and hallucinations and/or the need for chronic antipsychotic medications. Atrophy rate of the lateral frontal lobe correlated most significantly with onset of psychotic symptoms or need for chronic antipsychotic medications. Conclusions: Psychosis was associated with volume loss in specific regions of the lateral frontal and parietal lobes as well as anterior cingulate gyrus. Â© The Author(s) 2013.
