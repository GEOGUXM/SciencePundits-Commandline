The identification of centrally efficacious β-secretase (BACE1) inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimers disease (AD) has historically been thwarted by an inability to maintain alignment of potency, brain availability, and desired absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties. In this paper, we describe a series of truncated, fused thioamidines that are efficiently selective in garnering BACE1 activity without simultaneously inhibiting the closely related cathepsin D or negatively impacting brain penetration and ADME alignment, as exemplified by 36. Upon oral administration, these inhibitors exhibit robust brain availability and are efficacious in lowering central Amyloid β (Aβ) levels in mouse and dog. In addition, chronic treatment in aged PS1/APP mice effects a decrease in the number and size of Aβ-derived plaques. Most importantly, evaluation of 36 in a 2-week exploratory toxicology study revealed no accumulation of autofluorescent material in retinal pigment epithelium or histology findings in the eye, issues observed with earlier BACE1 inhibitors. © 2015 American Chemical Society.
