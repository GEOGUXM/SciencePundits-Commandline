Activation of β-catenin in neurons regulates mitochondrial function and protects against protein misfolding disorders, including Alzheimers disease and Huntingtons disease. Melatonin, a natural secretory product of the pineal gland, exerts neuroprotective effects through the activation of β-catenin. In this study, melatonin increased β-catenin protein expression and activation in human neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y cells. Melatonin also inhibited PrP (106126)-induced neurotoxicity and the inhibition attenuated by treatment of β-catenin inhibitor ICG-001. Activation of β-catenin blocked PrP (106126)-mediated downregulation of anti-apoptotic protein survivin and Bcl-2. Reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, translocation of Bax, and cytochrome c release which induced by PrP (106126) treatment were inhibited by β-catenin activation, which contributed to prevented PrP (106 126)-induced neuronal cell death. In conclusion, β-catenin activation by melatonin prevented PrP (106126)-induced neuronal cell death through regulating anti-apoptotic proteins and mitochondrial pathways. These results also suggest the therapeutic value of Wnt/b-catenin signaling in prion-related disorders as influenced by melatonin.
