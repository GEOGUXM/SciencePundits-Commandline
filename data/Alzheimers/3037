Hereditary inclusion body myopathy is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by rimmed vacuoles and by the presence of filamentous cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions. Inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia is a progressive autosomal dominant disorder associated with a mutation in valosin-containing protein (VCP) with typical onset of symptoms in the 30s. APOE e4 is a major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory, thinking, behavior, and emotion as a result of the excessive buildup and decreased clearance of b-amyloid proteins resulting in the appearance of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In conclusion, we report a unique patient with an APOE e4/APOE e4 genotype and atypical VCP disease associated with early Alzheimer disease and severe vision impairment. Future studies will elucidate the interaction of VCP mutations and APOE e4 alleles in understanding common mechanisms in AD and VCP disease. Â© 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.
