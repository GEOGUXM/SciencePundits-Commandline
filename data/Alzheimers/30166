Objective: Alzheimer's disease is currently deliberation to be a complex, multi factorial syndrome, unlikely to take place from a single causal factor; instead, a number of allied biological alterations are thought to put in to its pathogenesis. This may clarify why the currently available drugs, developed according to the archetypal drug discovery paradigm of "one-molecule-one-target," have turned out to be palliative. In light of this, drug combinations that can act at different levels of the neurotoxic cascade offer new avenues in the direction of curing Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. In similar, a new strategy is promising that of developing a single chemical entity able to amend multiple targets simultaneously. This has lead to a new paradigm in medicinal chemistry, the "multi-target-directed ligand" design strategy, which has previously been successfully exploited at both academic and industrial levels. Method: Flavone fused thiazole moiety were docked against AChE and BACE enzyme Using Schrodinger software. Results and Conclusion: As a case study, we report here on 1-(5-(3, 5, 6, 7, 8-pentahydroxy-4-oxo-4H-chromen-2-yl) benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3-(2-oxobutyl) urea (PS122), a new molecule developed following this strategy. The in-silico profile of 1-(5-(3, 5, 6, 7, 8-pentahydroxy-4-oxo-4H-chromen-2-yl) benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3-(2-oxobutyl) urea demonstrates the suitability of the new strategy for obtaining innovative drug candidates for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases as it inhibit both AChE and BACE enzyme through in-silico studies.
