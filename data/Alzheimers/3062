Movement disorders belong to the most complicated neurodegenerative diseases. The aetiology of these disorders is only partially understood and most probably multi-factorial. The treatment in these cases is normally restricted to the symptoms and has many side effects. Parkinson's disease is the most frequent movement disorder and the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimers disease. It is slowly progressive and affects different regions from the central and peripheral nervous systems. In this review, we would like to give the reader an overview of the latest studies done in this field. We believe that the new findings regarding the role of alpha-synuclein in the progression of Parkinsons disease will lead to new, more specific causal therapies.
