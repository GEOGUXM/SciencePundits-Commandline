Aim:Homocysteine (Hcy) can elicit neuronal cell death, and hyperhomocysteinemia is a strong independent risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) on Hcy-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and neuronal apoptosis in rat hippocampus.Methods:Adult male SD rats were intracerebroventricularly (icv) injected with Hcy (0.6 μmol/d) for 7 d. Before Hcy injection, the rats were treated with NaHS (30 or 100 μmol·kg -1 ·d -1, ip) and/or k252a (1 μg/d, icv) for 2 d. The apoptotic neurons were detected in hippocampal coronal slices with TUNEL staining. The expression of glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), cleaved caspase-12, and BDNF in the hippocampus were examined using Western blotting assays. The generation of H 2 S in the hippocampus was measured with the NNDPD method.Results:Hcy markedly inhibited the production of endogenous H 2 S and increased apoptotic neurons in the hippocampus. Furthermore, Hcy induced ER stress responses in the hippocampus, as indicated by the upregulation of GRP78, CHOP, and cleaved caspase-12. Treatment with the H 2 S donor NaHS increased the endogenous H 2 S production and BDNF expression in a dose-dependent manner, and significantly reduced Hcy-induced neuronal apoptosis and ER stress responses in the hippocampus. Treatment with k252a, a specific inhibitor of TrkB (the receptor of BDNF), abolished the protective effects of NaHS against Hcy-induced ER stress in the hippocampus.Conclusion:H 2 S attenuates ER stress and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus of Hcy-treated rats via upregulating the BDNF-TrkB pathway. © 2014 CPS and SIMM All rights reserved.
