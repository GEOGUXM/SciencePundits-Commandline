Alzheimer (AD) disease is the most frequent form of dementia. Several structural and functional genomic factors are strongly associated with AD candidate genes, including age of onset, cognitive decline and amyloid depositions. Serotonin (5- TH) receptors play an important role in psychosis in AD with cognitive impairment. This study is based on insilco identification and prioritization of the differentially expressed genes of the genetic network involved in AD. Fourteen 5-HT candidate genes interaction network associated with AD was generated using agilent literature search cytoscape plugin. The organic layout shows cross-interaction between the genes set. On merging the genetic network with gene expression profile data, notable changes in interaction patterns were observed. These changes revealed 5-HTR2A, 5-HTR2C and 5-HTR4 as important genes in AD. Further refinement with Enrichment Map indicated 5-HTR2C as novel candidate gene that showed high functional significance in correlation to Alzheimer's disease. Our result will be a crucial factor for better understanding of the genetic pathways involved in causing psychosis in AD and will form a future landmark in developing target based drug therapies against this disease.
