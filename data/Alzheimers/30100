Recent studies suggest that deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) into oligomeric aggregates and fibrils, hallmarks of Alzheimers disease, may be initiated by the aggregation of Aβ species other than the well-studied 40- and 42-residue forms, Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively. Here we report on key structural, dynamic, and aggregation kinetic parameters of Aβ43, extended by a single threonine at the C-terminus relative to Aβ42. Using aggregation time course experiments, electron microscopy, and a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements including backbone relaxation, dark-state exchange saturation transfer, and quantification of chemical shift differences and scalar coupling constants, we demonstrate that the C-terminal threonine in Aβ43 increases the rate and extent of protofibril aggregation and confers slow C-terminal motions in the monomeric and protofibril-bound forms of Aβ43. Relative to the neighboring residues, the hydrophilic Thr43 of Aβ43 favors direct contact with the protofibril surface more so than the C-terminus of Aβ40 or Aβ42. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of a small chemical modification to affect the properties of Aβ structure and aggregation, providing a mechanism for the potential role of Aβ43 as a primary nucleator of Aβ aggregates in Alzheimers disease. © 2014 American Chemical Society.
