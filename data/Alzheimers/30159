Objective. Current diagnostic guidelines encourage further research for the development of novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, especially in its prodromal form (i.e. mild cognitive impairment, MCI). Magnetoencephalography (MEG) can provide essential information about AD brain dynamics; however, only a few studies have addressed the characterization of MEG in incipient AD. Approach. We analyzed MEG rhythms from 36 AD patients, 18 MCI subjects and 27 controls, introducing a new wavelet-based parameter to quantify their dynamical properties: the wavelet turbulence. Main results. Our results suggest that AD progression elicits statistically significant regional-dependent patterns of abnormalities in the neural activity (p < 0.05), including a progressive loss of irregularity, variability, symmetry and Gaussianity. Furthermore, the highest accuracies to discriminate AD and MCI subjects from controls were 79.4% and 68.9%, whereas, in the three-class setting, the accuracy reached 67.9%. Significance. Our findings provide an original description of several dynamical properties of neural activity in early AD and offer preliminary evidence that the proposed methodology is a promising tool for assessing brain changes at different stages of dementia.
