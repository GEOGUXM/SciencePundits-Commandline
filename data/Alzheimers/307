We previously discovered that one specific scalemic preparation of myricanol (1), a constituent of Myrica cerifera (bayberry/southern wax myrtle) root bark, could lower the levels of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT). The significance is that tau accumulates in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, the most common being Alzheimers disease (AD). Herein, a new synthetic route to prepare myricanol using a suitable boronic acid pinacol ester intermediate is reported. An X-ray crystal structure of the isolated myricanol (1) was obtained and showed a co-crystal consisting of (+)-aR,11S-myricanol (2) and (-)-aS,11R-myricanol (3) coformers. Surprisingly, 3, obtained from chiral separation from 1, reduced tau levels in both cultured cells and ex vivo brain slices from a mouse model of tauopathy at reasonable mid-to-low micromolar potency, whereas 2 did not. SILAC proteomics and cell assays revealed that 3 promoted tau degradation through an autophagic mechanism, which was in contrast to that of other tau-lowering compounds previously identified by our group. During the course of structure-activity relationship (SAR) development, we prepared compound 13 by acid-catalyzed dehydration of 1. 13 had undergone an unexpected structural rearrangement through the isomyricanol substitution pattern (e.g., 16), as verified by X-ray structural analysis. Compound 13 displayed robust tau-lowering activity, and, importantly, its enantiomers reduced tau levels similarly. Therefore, the semisynthetic analogue 13 provides a foundation for further development as a tau-lowering agent without its SAR being based on chirality. Â© 2015 American Chemical Society.
