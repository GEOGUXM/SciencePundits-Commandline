Background/Study Context: Quality of life (QoL) has become an important outcome measure in clinical trials for Alzheimers disease (AD). The Quality of Life in Alzheimers Disease (QoL-AD) Scale is widely used for assessing QoL of patients with AD. This research aims to determine the factor structure of the QoL-AD Scale in AD patients.Methods: One hundred thirty-nine patients with mild-to-moderate AD were administered the QoL-AD Scale. Based on the model proposed for healthy people, confirmatory factor models were built using modification indices and residual analysis to improve the model fit.Results: Confirmatory factor analysis indicated poor fit for both the initial model and the single-factor model. Two models showed a good fit: a three-factor model (perceived health, perceived environment and perceived functional ability) and a two-factor model (perceived physical health and perceived psychological health). Because no differences in fit were found between both models, the authors proposed the more parsimonious solution as the best model.Conclusion: These results provide evidence supporting the construct validity of the QoL-AD Scale. This instrument seems to measure the perception of two related constructs (behavioral competence and environment) and could be used together with instruments measuring psychological well-being and the perception of health.
