Background: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 genotype is the most clearly documented risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD). Epidemiological studies demonstrate an accelerated rate of progression to dementia and AD in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We assessed the ApoE allele and genotypes frequencies in Cuban patients with MCI. Methods: We performed ApoE genotyping of 74 Cuban patients more than 65 years old. Cognitive assessments included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a cognitive battery for evaluating memory, attention, perception, and executive function. Results: Cognitive impairments were characterized by amnesia and executive deficits in patients with MCI. The Apo ε4 allele frequency was 0.196 in patients with MCI, 10-fold higher than that in the controls. Patients carrying the ε4 allele exhibited poorer performance in MMSE and tests assessing executive function and short-term memory than noncarriers. Conclusions: The patients exhibited amnestic MCI multiple domains. Cognitive performance was worse in patients who carried the ApoE e4 allele. © The Author(s) 2013.
