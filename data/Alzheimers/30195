There may be cultural differences in the experience of predeath grief in African American (AA)/Black caregivers for persons with Alzheimers disease (AD). The most commonly used screening tool, the Marwit and Meuser Caregiver Grief Inventory-Short Form (MMCGI-SF), was developed from focus groups with primarily Caucasian/White caregivers. Interviews were held with 19 AA spouse and adult child caregivers for persons with mild, moderate, and severe AD, and data were coded and compared with scale items on the MCMGI-SF to assess validity. Results from this study provide evidence for content and face validity of the MMCGI-SF for use in AA caregivers. Â© 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
