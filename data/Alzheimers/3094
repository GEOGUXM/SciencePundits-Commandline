Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. Multiple pathogenetic factors including aggregated β-amyloid (Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), cholinergic dysfunction and oxidative stress are involved in AD. Aβ, a major constituent of the senile plaques, is a potent neurotoxic peptide and has a pivotal role in cognitive deficit and reduced synaptic plasticity in AD. In the present study we examined the protective effect of troxerutin, as a multipotent bioflavonoid, on Aβ (1-42)-induced impairment of evoked field potential in hippocampal DG neurons. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups including Aβ (42-1), Aβ (1-42), Aβ (1-42) plus troxerutin and Aβ (42-1) plus troxerutin groups. Aβ was injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) into right lateral ventricle and after two weeks the evoked field potential recorded from perforant path-DG synapses to assess paired pulse paradigm and long term potentiation (LTP). Administration of Aβ (1-42) drastically attenuated the LTP of DG neurons, while there was no significant difference in evoked field potentials between Aβ (1-42) plus troxerutin group with respect to Aβ (42-1) group. This study revealed that troxerutin improves the synaptic failure induced by Aβ peptide and can be introduced as a promising multi-potent pharmacological agent in prevention or treatment of AD in the future. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
