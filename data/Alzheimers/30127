Background: Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with neuronal disorders, and mitochondrial dynamics are altered in neurodegenerative diseases. Results: Inhibition of mortalin potentiates amyloid-β-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and cytotoxicity. Conclusion: Inhibition of mortalin could lead to mitochondrial dysfunction through mitochondrial fragmentation. Significance: Activation of mortalin may antagonize the progression of Aβ-mediated neuronal injury in which mitochondrial dysfunction has a key role. © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.
