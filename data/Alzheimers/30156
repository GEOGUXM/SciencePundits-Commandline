The title compound, C24H25NO3·2CH3OH, which crystallized as a methanol disolvate, has applications as a PET radiotracer in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The dihedral angle between the biphenyl rings is 8.2 (2)° and the heterocyclic ring adopts a half-chair conformation with the N atom adopting a pyramidal geometry (bond-angle sum = 327.6°). The C atoms of both methoxy groups lie close to the plane of their attached ring [deviations = 0.107 (6) and 0.031 (6) Å]. In the crystal, the components are linked by O - H⋯O and O - H⋯N hydrogen bonds, generating [010] chains. C - H⋯O interactions are also observed.
