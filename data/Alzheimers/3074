Defective autophagy in Alzheimers disease (AD) promotes disease progression in diverse ways. Here, we demonstrate impaired autophagy flux in primary glial cells derived from CRND8 mice that overexpress mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP). Functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) restored normal autophagy by reversing abnormal activation of mTOR signaling and deficits in lysosomal proteolysis, thereby facilitating elimination of autophagic substrates. These findings suggest SWNT as a novel neuroprotective approach to AD therapy. Â© 2014 American Chemical Society.
