The self-Assembly of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides into senile plaques is the hallmark of Alzheimer"s disease. Recent experiments have shown that the English familial disease mutation (H6R) speeds up the fibril formation process of alloforms Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides altering their toxicity to cells. We used all-Atom molecular dynamics simulations at microsecond time scales with the OPLS-AA force field and TIP4P explicit water model to study the structural dynamics of the monomer and dimer of H6R sequences of both peptides. The reason behind the self-Assembly acceleration is common that upon mutation the net charge is reduced leading to the weaker repulsive interaction between chains that facilitates the peptide association. In addition, our estimation of the solvation free energy shows that the mutation enhances the hydrophobicity of both peptides speeding up their aggregation. However, we can show that the acceleration mechanisms are different for different peptides: the rate of fibril formation of Aβ42 increases due to increased β-structure at the C-terminal in both monomer and dimer and enhanced stability of salt bridge Asp23-Lys28 in monomer, while the enhancement of turn at residues 25-29 and reduction of coil in regions 10-13, 26-19, and 30-34 would play the key role for Aβ40. Overall, our study provides a detailed atomistic picture of the H6R-mediated conformational changes that are consistent with the experimental findings and highlights the important role of the N-terminal in Aβ peptide aggregation. © 2014 American Chemical Society.
