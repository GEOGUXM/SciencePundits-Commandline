Although PDE1 was the first discovered and is perhaps the most studied phosphodiesterase, a lack of potent and selective small molecules inhibitors suitable for use as chemical probes has hampered elucidation of biological processed linked to the enzyme. Recent advances have led to the discovery of new synthetic inhibitor molecules that hold promise in filling this void. These compounds are presented with chemical structures and PDE selectivity data where available, in addition to routes for their chemical synthesis and select information on binding modes.
