The performance of Cu<inf>2</inf>ZnSnS<inf>4</inf> based thin film solar cells can be efficiently improved by proper elemental substitution. This paper describes a facile and cost-efficient solvothermal route to synthesize Cu<inf>2</inf>(Sn<inf>1-</inf><inf>x</inf>Ge<inf>x</inf>)S<inf>3</inf> and Cu<inf>2</inf>Zn(Sn<inf>1-</inf><inf>x</inf>Ge<inf>x</inf>)S<inf>4</inf> (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) nanoparticles, using elemental sulfur, GeCl<inf>4</inf> and other metal salts as the precursors. To avoid the instability of pure CeCl<inf>4</inf> toward the moisture and protic solvents, its acetone solution was prepared to use in the synthesis. The resulting Cu<inf>2</inf>Zn(Sn<inf>1-</inf><inf>x</inf>Ge<inf>x</inf>)S<inf>4</inf> and Cu<inf>2</inf>(Sn<inf>1-</inf><inf>x</inf>Ge<inf>x</inf>)S<inf>3</inf> materials show tunable Ge/Sn ratios through simply adjusting the amount of metal salts in the starting materials, subsequently leading to composition-dependent band gap engineering. The Hall measurement and photoelectrochemical studies reveal that the synthesized Cu<inf>2</inf>Zn(Sn<inf>1-</inf><inf>x</inf>Ge<inf>x</inf>)S<inf>4</inf> and Cu<inf>2</inf>(Sn<inf>1-</inf><inf>x</inf>Ge<inf>x</inf>)S<inf>3</inf> materials are p-type semiconductor, and the electrical and photoelectrical properties indicate their application potential in thin film solar cells. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
