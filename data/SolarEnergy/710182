New composite material for storage and production of water from atmospheric air has been investigated experimentally. Experiments have been performed in the Indian climatic condition at NIT Kurukshetra, India [29° 58' (latitude) North and 76° 53' (longitude) East] in the month of October. Three numbers of newly designed solar glass desiccant box type system (SGDBS) having a capture area 0.36m2 each, have been used. The design parameters for the water production are height of glass from desiccant bed at 0.22m, inclination in angle at 30°, effective thickness of glass at 3mm and number of glazing as single. It is found that water production rate depends upon the concentration of CaCl<inf>2</inf> in the saw wood. Maximum quantity of water production by the composite material having 60% concentration is 180ml/kg/day. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.
