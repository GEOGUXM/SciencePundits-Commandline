The δ-Bi<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>-structural Bi<inf>11</inf>VO<inf>19</inf> nanoparticles with the average size of ∼70 nm were fabricated through the Pechini method for a possible photocatalytic application. The crystal structure was investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and the structural refinement. The as-synthesized sample was also characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), UV-vis spectroscopy and photoluminescence measurements. The experimental results demonstrate that Bi<inf>11</inf>VO<inf>19</inf> nanoparticles have an efficient visible light absorption with band-gap energy of 2.23 eV. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the photodegradation of the methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) as a function of time. All the results indicate that Bi<inf>11</inf>VO<inf>19</inf> could be a potential photocatalyst driven by visible-light. The effective photocatalytic activity was discussed on the base of the crystal structure characteristic. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
