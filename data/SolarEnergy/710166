The accurate prediction of direct solar irradiance is essential in many solar energy applications, particularly those relying on concentrating solar technologies. The present paper is aimed at a detailed assessment of a large range of clear-sky solar radiation models under Algerian climate to select the more accurate one for estimating the performance of solar power projects where meteorological and radiometric measurement stations are not available. To this end, seventeen models have been reviewed and their performance compared to measured irradiance of Ghardaia (Southern Algeria). The validation methodology presented herein is very helpful for ranking the models. A new statistical accuracy indicator has been originally introduced to find out the most accurate ones. A thorough analysis of selected models has shown that the more complex models, that seem at first sight more sophisticated, are not necessary the most accurate; while simpler models depending on a limited number of parameters are more suitable. In other words, the suitability and accuracy of a model do not necessarily improve with an increase in the number of its parameters. This important finding is in good agreement with the previous published studies. This fact is important to take into account, in the case where measured data are not available, for the selection of the most suitable locations for the installation of the future concentrating solar power plants in Algeria or even in other countries.
