Sheets of Ti6Al4V titanium alloy in flush corner joint configuration were successfully welded using a 2 kW thermal power vertical axis parabolic concentrator, in a controlled inert argon atmosphere. Longitudinal welds up to 60 mm were performed through controlled displacement of the specimens under the focus of the solar concentrator. After treatments, the welded joints were characterized by microhardness testing and microstructural analysis. Typical microstructures formed at different zones of the welded - melted zone, heat affected zone and base metal - have been identified. Several experimental process parameters have been varied until obtaining a defect-free welded joint. The optimal welding was obtained with solar radiation around 1000 W/m2 and at 0.15 mm/s constant tracking speed. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
