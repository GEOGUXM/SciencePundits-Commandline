Three synthesized and five new designed carbazole-based organic dye sensitizers before and after bonding to the TiO2 are theoretically investigated by density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory methods. The influences of inserting different groups between donor and acceptor and augmenting π-spacers on the performance are explored by optimized geometries, electronic structures, simulated absorption spectra, and other parameters. The efficiency of all dyes as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells is evaluated by the key parameters, including HOMO-LUMO energy gap, distance of charge transfer upon excitation from the ground to excited state, light-harvesting efficiency, injection driving force, and total reorganization energy related with the short-circuit current density and open-circuit photovoltage. It has been testified that both the nature and the number of π-linker units are important factors for the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
