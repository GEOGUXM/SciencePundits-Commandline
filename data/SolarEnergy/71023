Abstract Flat-plate solar collectors (FPSCs) utilize solar radiation, an alternate energy source, as fuel to heat a working fluid. However, since solar radiation and environmental conditions are different throughout the world, FPSCs cannot be considered one-size-fits-all systems. Therefore, FPSCs must be properly designed for use at a specific location. One of the methodologies to do so is to create models. Many FPSC models assume initial conditions, such as the initial absorber plate temperature and the initial heat transfer coefficient values. Assuming initial condition values is a major weakness in such models as it could cause erroneous or inaccurate output values. To overcome the necessity to assume initial condition values, the Typical Day Concept may be applied to FPSC models. By applying the Typical Day Concept in a FPSC model, all of the equations that calculate the output data for every single time step in a 24 h period are essentially combined into a single balance equation. The single balance equation eliminates the need to assume initial condition values while only allowing one single correct solution to the model's output data. This should help reduce the amount of time, money, and difficulty that may come with designing a FPSC. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
