In this letter, hybrid Cu/In/Ga precursor film was fabricated by co-sputtering of Cu<inf>0.8</inf>/Ga<inf>0.2</inf> and In targets simultaneously. Rapid thermal process was employed for the selenization of Cu/In/Ga precursor film. Homogeneous surface morphology and better crystallinity could be obtained for the CIGS film, which exhibited a preferential orientation with typical chalcopyrite phase. The composition of the CIGS film could be adjusted conveniently by controlling the sputtering power. The strong surface photovoltage response confirmed that the CIGS film had higher optoelectronic conversion ability. Our experimental findings presented in this letter demonstrated that the co-sputtering technique was a promising strategy for developing CIGS absorbers with high performances. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
