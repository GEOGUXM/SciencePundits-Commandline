Time-resolved characterization of solar irradiance at the ground level is a critical element in solar energy analysis. Siting of nodes in a network of solar irradiance monitoring stations (MS) is a multi-faceted problem that directly affects the determination of the solar resource and its spatio-temporal variability. The present work proposes an objective framework to optimize the deployment of solar MS over a sub-continental region. There are two main components in the proposed methodology. The first employs cluster analysis using the affinity propagation algorithm, to select the optimal number of clusters (regions with coherent solar microclimates) upon internal coherence criteria. The second component employs stochastic prediction and validation, through the use of a Bayesian maximum entropy method, and selects the optimal MS configuration, according to geostatistical criteria, among the solutions recommended by the cluster analysis. We apply this two-pronged methodology to determine clusters and optimal locations for global horizontal irradiance monitoring across the state of California. In this proof-of-concept study, 3 disparate MS configurations are examined within the cluster partition. The subsequent geostatistical analysis indicates that all configurations rank almost equally well based on different statistical error measures. The optimal configuration can be singled out depending on desired criteria of choice. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
