New triphenylamine-benzimidazole type small molecules with different electron-releasing groups were designed and synthesized to investigate their photovoltaic performances in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Their good visible absorptions covering the 400-535 nm in addition to suitable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels between -3.03 and -3.11 eV make good candidates them for DSSC devices. Fluorescence quenching studies of the dyes with pristine titania support the good electron injection to conduction band of TiO<inf>2</inf>. Time resolved measurements of the dyes in solutions indicate the occurence of charge generation during the excited state. One of the used dyes in DSSC devices, TPA5a, carrying a methoxy group in triphenylamine part of the structure, gave much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of 4.31% as compared to the other derivatives. Device fabricated from TPA5a dye gives good external quantum efficiency (EQE) value above 70% at 460 nm. Also, electron impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of the devices gives a good explanation of the understanding of the cell performances. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
