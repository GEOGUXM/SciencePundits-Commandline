The solar collectors have been commonly used in desalination systems. Recent investigations show that the use of a linear parabolic through collector in solar stills can improve the efficiency of a desalination system. In this work, a combination of a heat pipe and a twin-glass evacuated tube collector is utilized with a parabolic through collector. Results show that the rate of production and efficiency can reach to 0.27 kg/(m2 h) and 22.1% when aluminum conducting foils are used in the space between the heat pipe and the twin-glass evacuated tube collector to transfer heat from the tube collector to the heat pipe. When oil is used as a medium for the transfer of heat, filling the space between heat pipe and twin-glass evacuated tube collector, the production and efficiency can increase to 0.933 kg/(m2 h) and 65.2%, respectively.
