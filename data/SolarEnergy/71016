Mesocrystals, as the assemblies of crystallographically oriented nanocrystals, have single-crystal-like atom structures and scattering features but with much higher porosity than single-crystalline materials, making them promising substitutes for conventional single crystals in photoelectrochemical application. As a proof-of-concept, a series of photoelectrochemical tests were investigated to understand the influence of the differences between them on photoelectrochemical activity. Expectedly, comparing with TiO<inf>2</inf> single crystals, TiO<inf>2</inf> mesocrystals demonstrated higher photoelectrochemical capability, which provides unique new opportunities for materials design in the fields of solar-energy conversion and catalysis. Therefore, an elegant photoelectrochemical biosensing platform was firstly developed by virtue of carbon nanohorns with outstanding electrical conductivity support multifunctional TiO<inf>2</inf> mesocrystals to accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, and then horseradish peroxidase was introduced through the immune recognition reaction for enzyme-assisted in situ generating CdS QDs. The multiplex amplification strategy successfully achieved the ultrasensitive detection of α-fetoprotein antigen. Promisingly, the successful application of multiplex amplification strategy affords a rational and practical consideration for the fabrication of new and high-performance photoelectrochemical sensing devices. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
