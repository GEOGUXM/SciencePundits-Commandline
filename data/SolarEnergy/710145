This paper presents the Residential Solar Block (RSB) envelope, a derivative of the original solar envelope that enables the development of compact residential urban blocks with high passive solar potential. The presented construction method of the RSB envelope is transferable to different climatic and development conditions. The solar geometry data required for its construction is deduced from energy simulations of a typical thermal zone with respect to useful passive solar gains and local climatic needs. A pilot study of the RSB Envelope at an urban site in the Mediterranean demonstrates a significant improvement over the existing urban layout in terms of winter insolation. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
