Ternary Cd<inf>1-</inf><inf>x</inf>In<inf>x</inf>Te semiconductor nanoparticles have been demonstrated to be sensitizers for solar cell devices. The chemical bath deposition (CBD) process was used to synthesize Cd<inf>1-</inf><inf>x</inf>In<inf>x</inf>Te nanoparticles, which were deposited onto a mesoporous TiO<inf>2</inf> photoelectrode. Individual nanoparticles were estimated to have an average diameter range of ~10nm. The atomic percentages of chemical elements for Mn2+-doped Cd<inf>1-</inf><inf>x</inf>In<inf>x</inf>Te show that the structure could be Mn2+-doped CdInTe incorporated with CdIn<inf>2</inf>Te<inf>4</inf> structure. The resulted X-ray diffraction and diffraction ring patterns of Mn2+-doped Cd<inf>1-</inf><inf>x</inf>In<inf>x</inf>Te nanoparticles indicated the structure to be tetragonal. The optical band gaps were also decreased to 0.9eV after Mn2+ doping, compared with E<inf>g</inf>=1.47eV for undoped Cd<inf>1-</inf><inf>x</inf>In<inf>x</inf>Te(7). The best efficiency of 0.51% under 100 mW/cm2 (AM 1.5G) was obtained after Mn2+ doping with a short-circuit current density (J<inf>sc</inf>) of 1.71mA/cm2, an open-circuit voltage (V<inf>oc</inf>) of 0.739V and a fill factor (FF) of 40.2%. This work demonstrated the feasibility of using Cd<inf>1-</inf><inf>x</inf>In<inf>x</inf>Te with Mn2+ doping as a broadband solar absorber for TiO<inf>2</inf> photoelectrodes. Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.
