The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of B doped TiO<inf>2</inf> on the removal of metoprolol tartrate salt (MET) in ultrapure water (UW) and municipal secondary effluent (SE) using a Xenon lamp (photon flux of 2.99×10-6 Einsteins-1) as irradiation source. The analyzed parameters were MET removal, total organic carbon (TOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD<inf>5</inf>) and acute toxicity (Microtox®). The optimal photocatalyst concentration was determined in both matrices. After 180min of irradiation, 70% and 44% of MET were removed using 0.4gL-1 catalyst in UW and 2.0gL-1 catalyst in SE, respectively. A substantial improvement of biodegradability (BOD<inf>5</inf>/COD) was also achieved. The acute eco-toxicity decreased when MET was degraded and no toxic products were formed at the end of the process. Several reaction intermediates generated during the MET removal were identified and a possible degradation pathway was proposed for the TiO<inf>2</inf>/5%B(w/w) reaction. Photocatalysis with B-doped TiO<inf>2</inf> can be considered as an interesting MET degradation alternative, leading to higher removals and potential to use solar energy, thus, minimizing the operating costs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
