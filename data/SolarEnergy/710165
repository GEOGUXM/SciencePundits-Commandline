In the future, solar energy, along with other renewable resources, could play a key role in mass production of fine chemicals. It could also potentially solve environmental problems, as demonstrated by recent developments in the use of solar energy, such as solar photocatalysis. The solar photocatalytic technology has been demonstrated to be effective for:. •Treating groundwater, drinking water, industrial wastewater, and air and soil pollution,•Water disinfection, and•Industrial production of fine chemicals. This report summarizes the current status of solar photocatalysis and identifies future opportunities for research and industry in this field, including recent relevant bibliography. The main commercial solar photocatalytic applications are described, included the technologies based on sunlight for antifogging and self-cleaning of coating materials, glass, and concrete. An overview of several different solar photoreactors and the main operating process parameters are also provided. For the estimation of capital costs, it is suggested the use of appropriate "figures of merit". The present review would be of interest for researchers, technologists, engineers, and industrialists. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
