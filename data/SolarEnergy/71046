Given rapid depletion of conventional energy sources and environmental degradation caused by their over exploitation, the renewable energy sources are believed to be the future. Technologies utilizing renewable energy sources differ significantly from one another, not only with regard to technical and economic aspects but also in relation to their reliability, maturity, and operational experience in utility scale conditions. Technologies used to harness solar energy have emerged as the most promising and mature since solar energy is abundant, freely available, and it has commercial potential too. This paper presents a review of advancements made in the field of solar thermal technology with a focus on techniques employed for its performance enhancement. It also covers the description of different types of solar collectors to facilitate the systematic understanding of solar thermal technology and the novel modifications realized in each category of solar collectors have been highlighted to promote the use of solar energy in routine activities. Performance enhancement techniques such as geometrical modifications on the absorber plate, use of solar selective coatings and nanofluids have been given a special attention. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
