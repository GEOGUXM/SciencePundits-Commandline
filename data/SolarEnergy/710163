Abstract Photocatalytic H<inf>2</inf> production from water is one of the most attractive issues for the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy. In this study, the Ni<inf>x</inf>B/CdS photocatalyst was firstly used for photocatalytic H<inf>2</inf>-evolution reaction and showed efficient visible-light photocatalytic activity and good stability for H<inf>2</inf>-evolution from aqueous solution. The optimal Ni<inf>x</inf>B loading content was determined to be 0.8 wt.%, and the corresponding H<inf>2</inf>-production rate reached up to 4.8 mmol·h- 1·g- 1 after a 10 h visible light irradiation. It is proposed that the loading of Ni<inf>x</inf>B on the surface of CdS could effectively increase the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes and greatly enhance the photocatalytic activity. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.
