Photoactive srilankite-type zirconium titanate hollow spheres with submicrometer size have been successfully synthesized by employing sulfonated polystyrene (PS) latex particles as a template in conjunction with the sol-gel method. The structure of the particles was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The outer and inner diameters of the resulted hollow spheres were 190 and 160. nm, respectively. The inner diameter was on average 20% smaller than the diameter of template sulfonated PS latex particles. The UV-Vis spectrum of the new material was observed using integrating spheres. It shows higher band gap and better UV responsiveness in comparison to reference materials such as titania hollow spheres and commercially available Degussa P25. This fact makes them a promising candidate as a photocalyst from the view point of higher redox potential and effective use of UV-solar energy. Â© 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.
