More and more interest is dedicated to nano-CuO/TiO<inf>2</inf> mesoporous films which could be used in solar energy converting structures, sensors and photocatalysis applications. In this work we have studied the synthesis of CuO/TiO<inf>2</inf> nanocomposite films using a low temperature modified wet-impregnation technique. Copper(II) formate and copper(II) acetate aqueous solutions with varying concentrations are used as precursors for deposition of cupric oxide inside mesoporous TiO<inf>2</inf> layers. The obtained nanocomposite is characterized using XRD, SEM, AFM and UV-vis spectroscopy. Results show that the optical absorption spectrum of TiO<inf>2</inf> is extended significantly in the visible region and a CuO energy gap E<inf>g</inf> = 1.4 eV is deduced from the absorption edge. XRD experiments show evidence of CuO nanocrystals when using cupric formate aqueous solution as a precursor while for cupric acetate-prepared compound, no XRD peaks are observed suggesting a disordered CuO phase in that case.
