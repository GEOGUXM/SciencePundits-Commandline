Fast precise point positioning (Fast-PPP) is a satellite-based navigation technique using an accurate real-time ionospheric modeling to achieve high accuracy quickly. In this paper, an end-to-end performance assessment of Fast-PPP is presented in near-maximum Solar Cycle conditions; from the accuracy of the Central Processing Facility corrections, to the user positioning. A planetary distribution of permanent receivers including challenging conditions at equatorial latitudes, is navigated in pure kinematic mode, located from 100 to 1300 km away from the nearest reference station used to derive the ionospheric model. It is shown that satellite orbits and clocks accurate to few centimeters and few tenths of nanoseconds, used in conjunction with an ionosphere with an accuracy better than 1 Total Electron Content Unit (16 cm in L1) reduce the convergence time of dual-frequency Precise Point Positioning, to decimeter-level (3-D) solutions. Horizontal convergence times are shortened 40% to 90%, whereas the vertical components are reduced by 20% to 60%. A metric to evaluate the quality of any ionospheric model for Global Navigation Satellite System is also proposed. The ionospheric modeling accuracy is directly translated to mass-market single-frequency users. The 95th percentile of horizontal and vertical accuracies is shown to be 40 and 60 cm for single-frequency users and 9 and 16 cm for dual-frequency users. The tradeoff between the formal and actual positioning errors has been carefully studied to set realistic confidence levels to the corrections. Â© 1980-2012 IEEE.
