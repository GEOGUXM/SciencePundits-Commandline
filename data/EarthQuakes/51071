This work is devoted to the study of geophysical data by using different spline interpolation techniques. A spatial analysis of the California earthquakes geological data was performed, some of the methods proved to be more efficient than others depending on the number of data points considered. Overall, this class of interpolation surface proved to be a very powerful tool for analyzing geophysical data.
