Segmental tunnel linings are now often used for seismic areas. However, the influence of segment joints on the segmental lining behavior under seismic loading has not been thoroughly considered in the literature. This paper presents a numerical study, which has been performed under seismic circumstance, to investigate the factors that affect segmental tunnel lining behavior. Analyses have been carried out using a two-dimensional finite difference element model. The proposed model allows studying the effect of the rotational joint stiffness, radial stiffness and the axial stiffness of the longitudinal joints. The numerical results show that a segmental lining can perform better than a continuous lining during earthquake. It has been seen that the influence of the joint distribution, the joint rotational stiffness, the joint axial stiffness, Young[U+05F3]s modulus of the ground surrounding the tunnel, the lateral earth pressure factor and the maximum shear strain should not be neglected. Some important differences of the segmental tunnel lining behavior under static and seismic conditions have been highlighted. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
