Abstract We investigate shear wave polarization anisotropy in the upper crust around the source region of the 1891 Nobi earthquake, central Japan. At most stations, the orientation of the faster polarized shear wave is parallel to the axes of the maximum horizontal compressional strain rate and stress, indicating that stress-induced anisotropy is dominant in the analyzed region. Furthermore, near the source faults, the orientation of the faster polarized shear wave is oblique to the strike of the source faults. This suggests that microcracks parallel to the strike of the source fault, which would be produced by the fault movement of the Nobi earthquake, have healed with the healing of the faults. For stress-induced anisotropy, time delays normalized by path length in the anisotropic upper crust as a function of the differential strain rate are coincident with those in the inland high strain rate zone, Japan. These data, together with those of a previous study, show that the variation in the stressing rate, estimated from shear wave splitting, is close to that estimated from geodetic observation. This implies that the variation in the stressing rate in the brittle upper crust is linked to that in the strain rate on the ground surface. Â© 2015 Hiramatsu et al.; licensee Springer.
