Japan was an early leader in microgrid research, with the four demonstrations funded by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) between 2003 and 2008 being particularly influential. In addition, there have been several notable private sector projects, as well as some remote island, dc power, and sustainable community demonstrations. Objectives for the four NEDO projects were primarily to demonstrate the high penetration of local small-scale renewables,local control of diverse resources, islanding, reliability, and heterogeneous power quality (HeQ).
