The records from wideband IRIS stations after a strong earthquake are analyzed. A few days after the earthquake, pulsations with a period of 128 min arise and last for about a week. They appear as a periodical variation in the amplitude of the free radial oscillation of the Earth <inf>0</inf>S<inf>0</inf> having a period of 20.46 min. The period of the pulsations is more than double the period of the lowest-frequency free spheroidal oscillations of the Earth (53.9 min). The pulsations are most pronounced at the mid-latitudinal and equatorial stations and less distinct near the poles. The pulsations are phase synchronous at the nearby stations and antiphase at the stations located in the western and eastern hemispheres. The pulsation amplitude does not depend on the phase of the Earth’s tide. The shape and period of the pulsations are fitted by the model of beatings appearing in the Van der Pol oscillator with periodic forcing. The pulsations are hypothesized to result from asynchronous interaction between the free oscillations of the Earth. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.
