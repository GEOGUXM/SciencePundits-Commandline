Vulnerability in the face of disaster varies across individuals, households, neighbourhoods and social class. It is this social distribution of vulnerability in a given society that may turn hazardous events into disasters for some people and not for others. This distributional approach draws attention to continuities that explain catastrophes as an outcome of the workings of society prior to the event. Expanding on and partially deviating from this approach, in this paper, we draw attention to the social processes whereby vulnerability is modified and renegotiated in the period after the event of natural disaster where resources for disaster alleviation and reconstruction reach local communities. Specifically, we explore the social dynamics of house damage classification in the wake of the 2006 Central Java earthquake, and we explore relations between citizens and the state during post-disaster house reconstruction. We argue that disastrous outcomes of catastrophic events do not follow pre-existing fault lines of vulnerability in a simple or predictable manner, and that the social process of redistribution of vulnerability continues in the post-disaster scenario.
