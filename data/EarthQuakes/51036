Extensive and spectacular phenomena of soil liquefaction were observed during the Emilia seismic sequence that struck northern Italy on May-June 2012. A back-analysis with simplified procedures based on empirical correlations reveals a small liquefaction potential, which apparently underestimates the observed surface effects. Multiple and close-in-time events were a peculiar aspect of the sequence but cannot be accounted for within the simplified procedure. This study investigates their possible role in excess pore pressure build-up and hence liquefaction triggering. Results of a numerical analysis suggest that aftershocks played a determinant role, leading liquefaction phenomena to such a great extent as observed in the field. This evidence is to be considered when assessing the results obtained with empirical correlations. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
