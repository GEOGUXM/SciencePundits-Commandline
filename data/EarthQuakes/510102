Sichuan torrent frog, Amolops mantzorum, is widely distributed in high mountain stream of southwestern China. The expansion of small hydropower dams and the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake cause its populations sharply decreasing. A set of fifteen polymorphic microsatellite markers were isolated and characterized from transcriptome–derived microsatellite DNA for A. mantzorum. The isolated loci were all polymorphic and the number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 18. The observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.1212 to 0.9394 and from 0.1169 to 0.9086, respectively. One locus showed significant departure from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and there was no evidence of linkage disequilibrium. These microsatellites loci will provide important genetic data for study and conservation strategies for A. mantzorum. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
