The increasing availability of very high resolution (VHR) images regularly acquired over urban areas opens new attractive opportunities for monitoring human settlements at the level of individual buildings. This paper presents a novel approach to building change detection in multitemporal VHR synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The proposed approach is based on two concepts: 1) the extraction of information on changes associated with increase and decrease of backscattering at the optimal building scale and 2) the exploitation of the expected backscattering properties of buildings to detect either new or fully demolished buildings. Each detected change is associated with a grade of reliability. The approach is validated on the following: 1) COSMO-SkyMed multitemporal spotlight images acquired in 2009 on the city of L'Aquila (Italy) before and after the earthquake that hit the region and 2) TerraSAR-X multitemporal spotlight images acquired on the urban area of the city of Trento (Italy). Results demonstrate that the proposed approach allows an accurate identification of new and demolished buildings while presents a low false-alarm rate and a high reliability. Â© 1980-2012 IEEE.
