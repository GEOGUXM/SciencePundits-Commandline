The time variations in tidal response of the medium before the Great Tohoku earthquake in Japan are analyzed based on the data from the F-net seismic network stations closest to the source of this event. According to the horizontal pendulum data from these stations, which record the northward tilts, the tidal tilt amplitudes demonstrated a linear growth associated with the changes in the elastic moduli during the accumulation of the tectonic stresses. The growth phase was followed by a sharp decrease in the amplitudes of the tilts due to the release of the stresses by the earthquake. Â© 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.
