Three different earthquake seismic data sets are used to construct the earthquake networks following the prescriptions of Abe and Suzuki (2004). It has been observed that different links of this network appear with highly different strengths. This prompted us to extend the study of earthquake networks by considering it as the weighted network. Different properties of such weighted network have been found to be quite different from those of their un-weighted counterparts. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
