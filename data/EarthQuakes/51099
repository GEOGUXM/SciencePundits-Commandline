The mean shear wave velocity to a depth of 30m (VS30), established in the western United States, is the current site classification criterion for determining the seismic design ground motion, taking site amplification potential account into. To evaluate VS30 at a site, a shear wave velocity (VS) profile extending to a depth of at least 30m must be acquired using in situ seismic tests. In many cases, however, the obtained VS profile does not extend to a depth of 30m due to unfavorable field conditions and limitations of testing techniques. In this study, VS30 and the mean shear wave velocity to depths less than 30m (VSDs) were calculated using VS profiles of more than 30m obtained by seismic tests at 72 sites in Korea, and the correlation between VS30 and VSDs was drawn based on the computed mean VS data. Additionally, a method for extrapolating the VS profile from shallow depths to 30m and bedrock was developed by building a shape curve based on the average data of all VS profiles. These two methods of extrapolating VS30 from shallow VS profiles, using VSDs and a shape curve, resulted in less bias than the simple method in which the lowermost VS value obtained is extended to the depth of 30m. These two extrapolation methods are useful for VS profiles extending to depths of at least 10m. Furthermore, the shape curve method developed in this study may be useful in the western United States as well as in Korea. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
