A decrease in Q<inf>s</inf> values within the hanging wall of the ruptured Chelungpu fault two years following the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake was revealed by Q<inf>s</inf> tomography images and an analysis of single-path Q<inf>s</inf>. The synthetic and sensitivity tests of the Q<inf>s</inf> determination were carried out accordingly to justify the temporal variation. A Q<inf>s</inf> value within the hanging wall above the hypocenter was determined to be 157 ± 18 two years following the Chi-Chi earthquake, which is significantly lower than the Q<inf>s</inf> tomography values of 238 ± 17 and 289 ± 13 prior to and two years after the main shock, respectively. Similar values using a signal-path Q<inf>s</inf> analysis from events within the ruptured fault zone to stations along the fault were obtained. The corresponding Q<inf>s</inf> values were 247 ± 85 prior to the Chi-Chi earthquake. After the earthquake we obtained Q<inf>s</inf> values of 158 ± 75 and 318 ± 80 for 2 years following and 2 years after the earthquake, respectively. Considering the two independent methods in determination of Q<inf>s</inf>, the reduction in Q<inf>s</inf> by 89 two years following the Chi-Chi earthquake in both methods is significant. Along with 1 % V<inf>s</inf> reduction revealed by the analysis of repeating earthquakes our studies suggested possible reduction both in V<inf>s</inf> and Q<inf>s</inf> values within the fault zone after the Chi-Chi earthquake. Temporal changes in Q<inf>s</inf> after the Chi-Chi earthquake imply variations of pore-fluid saturation in the ruptured fault zone. The reduction in Q<inf>s</inf> two years following the Chi-Chi earthquake indicates high pore-fluid saturation within the fractured fault zone due to the postseismic fluid redistribution. © 2014, Springer Basel.
