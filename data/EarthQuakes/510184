A novel experimental method was designed to study the micro-behavior of saturated sand around a buried structure in centrifuge shaking table tests under strong simulated earthquake loading, in addition to the traditional macro-measurements. One free field test was first carried out as a reference, followed by one test with a deep buried structure and one with a shallowly buried structure. During the tests with the buried structure, high quality pictures of moving sand around the structure were recorded by a newly developed image acquisition system. By analyzing the interesting pictures at reasonable intervals using an image analysis software, the evolutions of microstructural features were obtained such as the orientations of the long axes of particles, the orientations of contact normals between particles and the average contact number of the interesting group of particles. The results showed that the evolutions of the micro-features were consistent with those of the macro-measurements such as excess pore pressures and accelerations, which help illuminate the mechanism of sand liquefaction.
