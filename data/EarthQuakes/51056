Geodetic data are increasingly being used to infer coseismic slip distribution due to its advantages of wide coverage and high accuracy. However, it is difficult to obtain a comprehensive rupture pattern at depth when a source model is only constrained by geodetic surface deformation. In this study, a joint inversion approach incorporating stress changes and GPS surface displacements is explored and applied to characterize the fault slip of the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, China. The earthquake data for the 20-year period before the main quake, which are collected from the background seismicity catalogues, and one month of aftershock data are statistically analysed to determine the fault stress changes based on the Dieterich model. The coseismic surface deformation measurements from 158 GPS surveying sites are jointly used to constrain the solution. Our preferred rupture model reveals four high-slip concentrations on the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault and one on the subparallel PengGuan fault. The spatial distribution suggests that the coseismic slip occurs not only above the hypocentre but also with a significant thrusting motion, with a mean slip of 8.5. m and a maximum of 9.7. m at a depth of 10-16. km. A significant high-slip concentration is found for the first time in this study. The coseismic faulting extends toward ~16. km southwest of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault and has a dextral strike-slip with a mean displacement of 4.8. m at a depth of 7-19. km. The joint inversion model misfits (GPS: 1.7. cm, stress change: 0.02. MPa) exhibit a good compatibility between the two types of datasets. The derived slip model, which has an improved resolution at depth, explains 98% of the coseismic surface displacements and 93% of the fault stress changes. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
