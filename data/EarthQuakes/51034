Seismic piezocone (SCPTu) data compiled from 86 sites in the greater Christchurch, New Zealand area are used to evaluate several existing empirical correlations for predicting shear wave velocity from cone penetration test (CPT) data. It is shown that all the considered prediction models are biased towards overestimation of the shear wave velocity of the Christchurch soil deposits, demonstrating the need for a Christchurch-specific shear wave velocity prediction model (McGann et al., 2014) [1]. It is hypothesized that the unique depositional environment of the considered soils and the potential loss of soil ageing effects brought about by the 2010-2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence are the primary source of the observed prediction bias.
