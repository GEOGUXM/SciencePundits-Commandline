Injection of concentrated bentonite suspensions into granular soils is one of the effective methods to improve the stability of the soil deposits against earthquake-induced liquefaction. While the constitutive model parameters of the suspensions are crucial to characterize their flow through granular soils, the determination of the model parameters is challenging because the flow characteristics of the bentonite suspensions vary with the amount of ionic additives and resting time. The objective of this study is to investigate the constitutive model parameters of concentrated bentonite suspensions modified with sodium pyrophosphate (SPP) in the context of their flow through granular soils and stability over time. 7.5, 10, and 12 wt% bentonite suspensions were tested at 0–7 wt% SPP concentrations. The time-dependent behavior of 10 wt% suspensions was also monitored at various resting times. Yield stress, flow consistency index (K) (or plastic viscosity), and flow behavior index (n) were determined by matching the experimental data to the Herschel–Bulkley or Bingham model. The results show that the yield stresses of the suspensions reach approximately 1 Pa at 1, 2, and 4 wt% SPP for the 7.5, 10, and 12 wt% suspensions, respectively. The K values increase sharply and then decrease with the increase of SPP concentration. The n values decrease with the initial dosage of the SPP, but increase with the additional amount of the SPP, converging to approximately 0.8. The yield stress of SPP-modified suspensions increases over resting time and the n values converge to 1. The critical storage modulus of the modified suspensions increases as yield stress increases, producing a strong time-independent correlation with yield stress. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
