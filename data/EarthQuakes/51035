This study presents a detailed failure analysis of seven masonry churches, which were severely damaged during the 2012 Emilia-Romagna (Italy) seismic sequence, by means of 3D FE non-linear dynamic simulations. The main aims of the numerical investigations are: (1) to carry out a sufficiently wide sensitivity study on different specific case studies to have an insight into the role played by the geometry - which is always unique for churches - and by the irregularities; (2) to validate or address the limits of applicability of the most widespread conventional static approaches recommended by Italian Code, i.e. kinematic limit and pushover analyses. Non-linear dynamic analyses are carried out assuming that masonry behaves as a non-linear material exhibiting softening and damage, frictional behavior and different strength in tension and compression. The set of case studies investigated in this work shows how conventional static approaches are still capable of roughly identifying the most critical macro-elements that usually activate a failure mechanism, but that the results (e.g. collapse acceleration, behavior factor) are affected by a level of approximation that may considerably depend on in-plan irregularity and hypotheses done on the interlocking between contiguous walls. From the comparative analyses carried out, it is authors' opinion that it is always beneficial to perform different types of analysis in order to have a comprehensive insight into the portions of the structure that can suffer a partial collapse with high probability. Once the active mechanism is identified, non-linear dynamic analyses, with more sophisticated material models and with refined FE discretizations of the critical regions, may be useful to deepen the knowledge of the behavior of such complex structures under seismic actions.
