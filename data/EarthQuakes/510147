Ambient noise measurements were performed at the island of Ischia (southern Italy) along alignments of 2.4-7. km by using two three-component seismic stations. Synchronous noise recordings of 2-20. h were cross-correlated over 20-30. s windows, stacked and iteratively band-pass filtered to enhance the dispersive wave trains. Frequency time analysis was performed on the vertical and radial components of cross-correlations and the fundamental-mode Rayleigh wave group velocity was obtained. Validation of the dispersion data was possible with those obtained from an earthquake recording along a close path. The non-linear inversion of average Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion curves along 13 paths (receiver inter-distances) allowed the definition of shear wave velocity models in the uppermost 1-2. km of the crust.The correlation of V<inf>S</inf> profiles vs. depth and drilling stratigraphy allowed to attribute V<inf>S</inf> lower than 1km/s to tuffs and V<inf>S</inf> of 1.41km/s to very fractured lavas. Higher V<inf>S</inf> are found in the central area of the island, in correspondence of the resurgent area. The top of the trachytic lava basement, with V<inf>S</inf> of 2.2-2.4km/s and density of 2.3g/cm3 is about 0.6-0.7km deep b.s.l. in the centre of Ischia, below altered, very fractured lava or thermally altered tuff.
