In this paper, the rotational loading pattern of multi-storey buildings supported on the spread and continuous interconnected single foundations is discussed. To achieve this, simplified relations for the estimation of (1) point rotations; (2) spatial variation of strong ground motions, and (3) foundation input motions are derived. The height-wise variation of the earthquake rotational loading of multi-storey buildings is parametrically evaluated by considering the location of the first rigid floor diaphragm and foundation type. In addition, the effect of the kinematic soil-structure interaction on the response spectrum of the rotational and translational components is studied. The numerical results provide a deeper insight into the rotational loading of structures in the middle-field zone, and show how the rotational components may detrimentally affect the structural response of multi-storey buildings depending on their kinematic characteristics.
