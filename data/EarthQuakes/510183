The Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand is rarely considered as an important source for tsunamis. We review the past 1000. years of unusual events and find evidence for three (possibly four) large tsunamis, one historical and two during the period of Māori occupation prior to European arrival. Event 1 appears to have affected the town of Westport, New Zealand on the 12th August 1870 and Event 2 occurred in the South Taranaki Bight between 1470 and 1510. AD although it may extent farther south along New Zealand's West Coast. There are currently insufficient data to determine whether the West Coast sites represent a separate event or are associated with Event 2. Event 3 occurred between 1320 and 1450. AD along the West Waikato coast of the North Island, New Zealand. In attempting to identify possible tsunamigenic sources for these large events we note the importance of considering a range of potential tsunamigenic options such as complex subduction zone earthquakes and a range of slope failure scenarios in order to better understand the threats posed not only by Tasman Sea sources but for similar geographical locations around the World. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
