An energy-based liquefaction potential evaluation method (EBM) previously developed was applied to a uniform sand model shaken by seismic motions recorded at different sites during different magnitude earthquakes. It was also applied to actual liquefaction case histories in Urayasu city during the 2011 M9.0 Tohoku earthquake and in Tanno-cho during the 2003 M8.0 Tokachi-oki earthquake. In all these evaluations, the results were compared with those by the currently used stress-based method (SBM) under exactly the same seismic and geotechnical conditions. It was found that EBM yields similar results with SBM for several ground motions of recent earthquakes but has easier applicability without considering associated parameters. In Urayasu city, the two methods yielded nearly consistent results by using an appropriate coefficient in SBM for the M9.0 earthquake, though both overestimated the actual liquefaction performance, probably because effects of plasticity and aging on in situ liquefaction strength were not taken into account. In Tanno-cho, EBM could evaluate actual liquefaction performance due to a small-acceleration motion during a far-field large magnitude earthquake while SBM could not. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
