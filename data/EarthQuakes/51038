Ground surface deformation monitoring is important for understanding regional crustal movement. However, in eastern Hainan Island, China, few near-field geodetic observations are available; thus, the in situ crustal movement remains poorly understood. In this study, the deformation field of the eastern Hainan Island region was captured from 2007 to 2011 by applying the stacking-InSAR approach to ALOS PALSAR images. The results exhibit a trough deformation pattern that extends along the small to moderate earthquake belt with a maximum peak-to-trough range change rate of approximately 9. mm/year. We propose that a magma-fed dyke is responsible for the observed surface deformation pattern. The modeled dyke is approximately 54. km long, 1. km wide, dipping 71° to the west, centered 25. km fixed during modeling beneath eastern Hainan Island, and strikes nearly N-S, parallel to the elongated pattern of seismicity in the area. We infer that the regional stress field favors the formation of dyke beneath eastern Hainan Island; consequently, the intruding magma has accumulated in an elongated, dyke-like storage zone. The zone dilated progressively over time, accompanied by sporadic earthquakes and subtle surface deformation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
