On October 8th, 2010, a 5.0 mb earthquake with intensity VI (MM) occurred close to Mara Rosa, in the North of Goiás State, central Brazil, in an area where previous low magnitude seismicity had been observed. This earthquake was felt up to 300km away from the epicenter, and was the biggest event ever detected in Central Brazil Seismic Zone. Despite the difficulty of associating earthquakes in Stable Continental Interior with geological structures, this event is possibly related to the reactivation of a geological fault of the continental-scale Transbrasiliano Lineament (TBL): the aftershock activity observed with an 8-station seismic network, indicates a NW dipping, SW-NE trending reverse fault, parallel to the TBL. The P axis is NW-SE oriented, consistent with expected stress direction in the region. Cross correlation technique was used to synchronize the weak P- and S- wave phases of some of the aftershocks, recorded at regional stations, with the corresponding arrivals of the main shock producing a consistent set of relative arrival times. The use of regional station corrections allowed the mainshock to be located with uncertainties small enough to qualify for a GT5 event, which will help to constrain 3D velocity models in South America. We found that the aftershocks were distributed around a circular area about 1.5-2.0km across, with no events in the middle. This is interpreted as the mainshock rupture completely releasing all stresses. The rupture area and the mainshock moment correspond to a stress-drop of about 2MPa. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
