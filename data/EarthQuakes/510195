The seismic performance assessment of modified steel moment-resisting frame (SMRF) was carried out by nonlinear time-history analysis. The basic bare SMRF was reduced in strength first and then enhanced by installing passive energy dissipating devices (EDDs) to develop modified frame. Passive EDDs comprise both rate-dependent and rate-independent devices. Viscous fluid damper (VFD) is a rate-dependent device whereas buckling-restrained brace is a rate-independent device. The lateral strength of structure was improved by using these devices either alone or in combination. Seven-scaled time-history records were used for incremental dynamic analysis. The stiffness effect on the stories is demonstrated through the lateral displacement profile of the building. The VFD is found to be a good EDD as it significantly improved the performance of the frame at all levels of seismic analysis. Â© 2015 The Institution of Engineers, Singapore
