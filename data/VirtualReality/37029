Tracking multiple objects is critical to automatic video content analysis and virtual reality. The major problem is how to solve data association problem when ambiguous measurements are caused by objects in close proximity. To tackle this problem, we propose a multiple information fusion-based multiple hypotheses tracking algorithm integrated with appearance feature, local motion pattern feature and repulsion–inertia model for multi-object tracking. Appearance model based on HSV–local binary patterns histogram and local motion pattern based on optical flow are adopted to describe objects. A likelihood calculation framework is proposed to incorporate the similarities of appearance, dynamic process and local motion pattern. To consider the changes in appearance and motion pattern over time, we make use of an effective template updating strategy for each object. In addition, a repulsion–inertia model is adopted to explore more useful information from ambiguous detections. Experimental results show that the proposed approach generates better trajectories with less missing objects and identity switches. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
