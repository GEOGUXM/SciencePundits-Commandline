This paper briefly reviews the history and purposes of neuropsychological assessment, as well as advancements in this area, and discusses the development of neuropsychological tests, using examples developed by the author and his colleagues to measure different aspects of human memory. These include the Shum Visual Learning Test, the Australian Retrograde Memory Test, the Comprehensive Assessment of Prospective Memory and the Virtual Reality Prospective Memory Task. The intended uses and psychometric properties of these tests, as well as examples of their use in research and clinical settings, will also be discussed. The paper will conclude with recommendations and advice on the development of neuropsychological tests based on the author's own experience.
