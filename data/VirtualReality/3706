This study applies the uses and gratifications theory (U&G) to examine self-disclosive behavior on Facebook. Using a convenience sample of 301 Facebook users, path analyses were conducted to determine how individual factors, social cohesion, and motives affect the honesty, valence, and intent of self-disclosure. Results showed that U&G provided a useful model for exploring the relationships among study variables. Facebook users motivated by relationship maintenance were generally more honest, intentional, and positive than others. Higher self-esteem was related to more positive self-disclosure, as well. Conversely, participants motivated to use Facebook for virtual community and companionship disclosed the most dishonest, unintentional, and negative information. These and other direct and indirect predictors of self-disclosure are discussed in light of the existing literature on Facebook self-disclosure.
