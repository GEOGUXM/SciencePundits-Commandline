Introduction and hypothesis: This video’s proposal was to present one of the pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training programs, used in our research, that we designed as a virtual reality intervention protocol and investigated its effects on PFM contractility. Methods: Two clinical, controlled and prospective studies were conducted, one with 19 nulliparous women without urinary symptoms, who were evaluated by both electromyography and digital palpation (DP) and another with 27 postmenopausal women with mixed urinary symptoms (assessed by both ICIQ UI-SF and ICIQ-OAB), evaluated by vaginal dynamometry and DP, with a total of 46 women in both studies. This protocol was designed so that the participant would play a video game, seated on a pressure base platform, while commanding it through her pelvic movements. Using a virtual reality game, five activities were performed during 30 min, twice a week, with a total of 10 sessions. Results: A significant increase in PFM strength was found in both the nulliparous (p = 0.0001) and the postmenopausal (p = 0.0001) groups of women, as ascertained by DP. A significant increase in postmenopausal women’s muscle strength and endurance assessed by dynamometry (p = 0.05) and a concomitant decrease in their urinary symptoms, were observed. Conclusion: This virtual reality program promoted an increase in PFM contractility and a decrease in postmenopausal urinary symptoms. © 2015 The International Urogynecological Association
