Medical devices play a crucial role in all diagnosis, care and treatment of patients and the number and variety of medical devices is huge and increasing annually. Healthcare professionals handle a wide range of devices every day. In this paper 3D Web-based interactive learning applications, which provide a helpful background, reminder and practical training to medical devices, have been developed. This article presents the production cycle of these interactive learning objects and the study conducted to measure the students’ perception of the objects’ effectiveness for learning. Three 3D Web-based interactive medical devices (sphygmomanometer, an electrocardiogram and a defibrillator) are described. Each of these applications introduces elements of interactivity with the learning content, and provides a practical training to the use of the medical devices. This e-learning package is aimed at all medical, nursing and allied healthcare professionals working in all healthcare settings and environments. It is also for all pharmacists in any environment and all community care workers in nursing and private healthcare settings. This training will also be useful to all staff working in a patient or patient supporting area, either someone new to the role or to a long standing professional as a reminder of best practice. © 2015 Springer-Verlag France
