This paper reports an array vibrotactile actuator which is suitable for fitting into virtual reality simulators. A 3x3 array actuator, of size 15x15x1 mm3, consists of nine cantilever structured cells of which the pillars are supported and made with cellulose acetate by a molding technique. The fabrication process and performance test along with results for the suggested vibrotactile actuator are explained. To simulate the touch force, the top mass is added on the actuator and the actuator performance is measured under actuation. When 2000 V<inf>p-p</inf> voltage is applied to the actuator, the averaged maximum acceleration for all cells is 0.44α0.19 g, which is above the vibrotactile threshold. The actuation mechanism is associated with the electrostatic force between top and bottom electrodes. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.
