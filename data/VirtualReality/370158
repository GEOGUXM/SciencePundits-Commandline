The paper provides a novel solution to implement the IPv6 QoS system as one of Parallel Internets. This approach exploits both an IP protocol and a virtualization technology. Therefore, the proposed IPv6 QoS system is an evolutionary approach for Future Internet. Also, an important advantage of the proposal is that virtual nodes of the IPv6 QoS network operate on separated control and data planes. Such a way of the implementation allows to develop the system with flexible routing and virtual network management. Â© 2015 The Author(s)
