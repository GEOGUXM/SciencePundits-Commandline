A minimum dose method based on staff walking road network model was proposed for the walking-path planning in nuclear facilities. A virtual-reality simulation program was developed using C# programming language and Direct X engine. The simulation program was used in simulations dealing with virtual nuclear facilities. Simulation results indicated that the walking-path planning method was effective in providing safety for people walking in nuclear facilities. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
