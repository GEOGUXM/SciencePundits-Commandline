This study proposes an innovative clothing fit evaluation method for virtual try- on using 3D digital human model. The clothing patterns are first designed and subsequently sewn together around a human model. Because complex cloth shapes are difficult to fit onto the human body, this study proposes a 3D human model dressed using virtual clothes according to the model’s body shape. Different clothing sizes are tested to fit onto a human body to assure satisfactory fit. Several test subjects were recruited in this study. Representations of several different sized clothing were compared between an actual human body (RB) and virtual model (VM) to evaluate the virtual try-on clothing fit. The clothing fit of specified sizes was evaluated quantitatively by calculating the vacant space area between the clothes and human body. The vacant space measure is used to perform real and virtual body fit evaluations. The clothing fit information obtained in this study can be applied to the development of clothing products in the apparel industry. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
