The increased availability of smartphone and mobile gadgets has transformed the tourism industry and will continue to enhance the ways in which tourists access information while traveling. Augmented reality has grown in popularity because of its enhanced mobile capabilities. In tourism research, few attempts have been made to assess user satisfaction with augmented reality applications and the behavioral intention to recommended them. This study uses a quality model to test users' satisfaction and intention to recommend marker-based augmented reality applications. By applying process theory, this study also investigates the differences in these constructs between high- and low-innovativeness groups visiting a theme park in Jeju Island, South Korea. Questionnaires administered to 241 theme park visitors revealed that content, personalized service, and system quality affect users' satisfaction and intention to recommend augmented reality applications. In addition, personal innovativeness was found to reinforce the relationships among content quality, personalized service quality, system quality, and satisfaction with augmented reality.
