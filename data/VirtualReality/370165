Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are involved in the control of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and are considered important targets to treat diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. The available PPAR ligands have several side effects leading to health risks justifying the search for new bioactive ligands to activate the PPAR subtypes, in special PPARδ, the less studied PPAR isoform. Here, we used a structure-based virtual screening protocol in order to find out new PPAR ligands. From a lead-like subset of purchasable compounds, we identified 5 compounds with potential PPAR affinity and, from preliminary in vitro assays, 4 of them showed promising biological activity. Therefore, from our in silico and in vitro protocols, new PPAR ligands are potential candidates to treat metabolic diseases. © 2015 Maltarollo et al.
