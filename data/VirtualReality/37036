Novel protein kinase CK2 inhibitors were identified using the solvent dipole ordering virtual screening method. A total of 26 compounds categorized in 15 distinct scaffold classes inhibited greater than 50% of enzyme activity at 50 μM, and eight exhibited IC<inf>50</inf> values less than 10 μM. Most of the identified compounds are lead-like and dissimilar to known inhibitors. The crystal structures of two of the CK2 complexes revealed the high accuracy of the predicted binding modes. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.
