The quest for determining the glamorous conditions of the human facial skin based on the texture, color, health perception, races, age and charm is never-ending. Manifestation of facial skin is subjected to the physical and physiological state of human emotions. The facial expression and appearance alters as we move, talk, think and endure stress under constant flux. The colors of skin is one of the key indicators of these changes and the color resolution is decided by the scattering and absorption of light within the skin layers containing chromophores in the melanin and hemoglobin oxygenation in the blood. Understanding the facial color distribution, homogeneity of the pigmentation or skin quality under stimuli are the key issues. We examine the correlation between blood oxygenation in changing facial skin color and basic natural emotional expressions such as angry, happy, sad and fear using the Pulse Oximetry and 3D skin analyzer. The data from seven subjects with three female of age 17, 25 and 35 years, four male of 22, 30, 36, 40 years under different number of partially extreme facial expressions are feed in the new dynamic model for simulation. Experimental results are analyzed to establish a direct relationship between human emotion and facial oxygenation. The strong emotion such as anger is found to stimulate more oxygen under facial skin transforming the face red or rosiness. Furthermore, other emotions assisted with less oxygen concentration create the skin pallor or whitish. Our results in perceiving the human emotions based on facial skin color may contribute towards the development of human aided virtual reality and game environment. ©2015, 3D Research Center, Kwangwoon University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
