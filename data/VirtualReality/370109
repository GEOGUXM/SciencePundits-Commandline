With the advances in computer technology nowadays, the virtual manufacturing technology has provided a new way in casting process design. In this study, a virtual reality system of casting production process named VR-Casting has been developed. The full range of virtual display about the casting process has been revealed under the network environment. Several key technologies applied in VR-Casting were introduced in this paper, such as a novel network running environment, the latest Web3D drawing standard named WebGL, levels of detail technology used for rendering on demand, and the detection and updating technology in the casting motions. Based on the above technologies, different 3D models and the virtual panoramic scene were established. Motion schema and user interface of the casting process was delicately designed to enable the system a better interactivity. The latest internet graphics standard WebGL was used to render the models. As VR-Casting is characterized as lightweight and cross-platform, it offers access to the visualization for various platforms and devices. The demonstration delivers VR-Casting has a broad application prospect like exhibition, education, training, and process analysis. Some tests were implemented on different devices, and the results demonstrated VR-Casting has a splendid performance when conducting tests on rendering models. When using VR-Casting, observer has a certain sense of immersion with arbitrarily adjusting of the observation angle and even watches deeply into the interior of the casts. Thus, observer can master the details in a more comprehensive and diverse way during the casting process. Â© 2015 Springer-Verlag London
