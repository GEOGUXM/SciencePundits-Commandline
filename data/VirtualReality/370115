To support maximum number of users/applications the concept of virtualization is employed. Network virtualization deals with supporting the concurrent wired/wireless network activities and utilizing the available physical (substrate) network efficiently by implementing an ideal virtual network embedding algorithm. Mapping virtual network requests to substrate network is an important problem and is done to optimize certain characteristic parameters of the network system. Most of the virtual network mapping models consider, mapping of the network requests on a single physical network. This work proposes a model for the virtual network mapping onto multiple substrate networks with the objective to optimize the revenue for the network service providers. In the process, some other parameters such as acceptance ratio of the VN requests etc. also improve. Experimental study reinforces the efficacy of the proposed model.
