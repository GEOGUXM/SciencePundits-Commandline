Leveraging the development of mobile communication technologies and increased capabilities of mobile devices, mobile multimedia services have set new trends. To support high-quality Video-on-Demand (VoD) in mobile wireless networks, using virtual community-based approaches to balance the efficiency of content sharing and maintenance cost of performance-aware solutions has attracted increasing research interest. In this paper, we propose a novel Performance-aware Mobile Community-based VoD streaming solution over vehicular ad hoc networks (PMCV). PMCV relies on a newly designed mobile community detection scheme and an innovative community member management mechanism. The former employs a novel fuzzy ant-inspired clustering algorithm and an innovative mobility similarity estimation model to group together the mobile users with similar behavior in terms of playback and movement into mobile communities. The latter introduces the role and task of members, member join and leave, collaborative store and search for resources, and replacement of a broker member. Simulation-based testing shows how PMCV outperforms another state-of-the-art solution in terms of performance. Â© 2014 IEEE.
