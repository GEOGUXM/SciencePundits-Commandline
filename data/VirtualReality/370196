What is Internet governance from a layman's perspective? And why should ordinary people care about it? Compare the Internet governance ecosystem to the rainforest. The Internet has become the planet's nervous system, turning global society heavily dependent on it, because so many modern services rely on Internet connectivity. However, the Internet isn't a 'single issue' that must be regulated. In that sense, the Internet, as it has evolved over half a century, penetrates all areas of political, economic, cultural, and social life. Thus, to a high degree, the Internet governance ecosystem is the 21st century's virtual environment. Life without the Internet is unthinkable for today's youth, who will be tomorrow's decision makers. Yet from the 20th-century perspective, everyone knows the consequences of polluting the natural environment; the lesson learned is to be careful with all kinds of environmental harms, keeping real and virtual environments as healthy as possible.
