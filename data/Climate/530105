Mexico is an oil-producing country which has both fossil and renewable resources. The Gulf of Mexico is its primary source of conventional resources. The economic and environmental uncertainties arising from the widespread use of hydrocarbons, oil and natural gas make it necessary to develop indigenous renewable sources to promote the transition to a diversified energy mix, thus achieving a more sustainable energy model. Solar resources are important because of the high radiation levels throughout the country. Although use of solar power is conditioned by the climatic and meteorological characteristics of the area, it is likely to be applied in both electrical and thermal systems.The coastal region of the Gulf of Mexico is characterized by a warm, humid climate and rugged terrain, with elevations over 1000m. These conditions mean that in the central and southern areas, solar radiation is mainly diffuse. However, studies indicate that in spring and summer global irradiation can reach 4kWh/m2day in the central and southern regions, and ascend to 6.7kWh/m2day in the northwest. These levels are suitable for the development of solar photovoltaic energy and low temperature thermal installations, since the degree of cloud cover in these zones complicates the use of Concentrated Solar Power technology.
