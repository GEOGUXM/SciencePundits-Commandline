Soil respiration, one of the most important carbon fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems, is very sensitive to climate change. Understanding the spatial patterns of temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q<inf>10</inf>) and its controlling factors is very important to quantify the climate-carbon cycle feedback at regional scales. In this study, we conducted a synthesis of 74 field measurements on Q<inf>10</inf> value across China's forests. Based on the overall data, the Q<inf>10</inf> values ranged from 1.10 to 5.18, with a mean value of 2.51. Moreover, the largest relative frequency of Q<inf>10</inf> values was within the range of 2.0-3.0. The Q<inf>10</inf> value in China's forests was significantly and negatively correlated with mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation. However, the Q<inf>10</inf> values increased with latitude and altitude but there was no obvious relationship between Q<inf>10</inf> and longitude. There were no significant differences in Q<inf>10</inf> among evergreen coniferous forest, coniferous-broadleaved mixed forest, deciduous broadleaved forest and deciduous coniferous forest. However, the Q<inf>10</inf> of evergreen broadleaved forest was significantly lower than that of evergreen coniferous forest and deciduous coniferous forest. The findings may advance our understanding on the different environmental controls of Q<inf>10</inf> of soil respiration and also improve our ability to predict regional-scale soil carbon flux in a changing world.
