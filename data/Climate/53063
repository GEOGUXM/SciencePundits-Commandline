A review on icing physics, ice detection, anti-icing and de-icing techniques for wind turbines in cold climate has been performed. Typical physical properties of atmospheric icing and the corresponding meteorological parameters are presented. For computational modeling of ice accretion on turbine blades, the LEWINT code was adopted to simulate ice accretion on an aerofoil for a 2MW wind turbine. Ice sensors and the basic requirements for ice detection on large blades are described. Besides, this paper presents the main passive and active ice mitigation techniques and their advantages and disadvantages. Scope of future work is suggested as wind turbine blades scale up.
