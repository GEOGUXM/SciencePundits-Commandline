Proper ventilation system is required to provide good indoor air quality. However, unnecessary ventilation can consume a huge amount of energy. Potential saving can be achieved by ensuring that efficient heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems are used. Moreover, reducing the energy consumption by adopting energy-efficient buildings can improve the thermal comfort of the occupants. In the hot and humid climates, natural ventilation by opening the windows and doors may enhance the humidity inside the building and affect comfort, consequently. Since humidity contributes to poor indoor quality and may be a major cause of discomfort, application of mechanical ventilation systems is increased compared with natural ventilation in tropical climates. Further, the power consumption of the air conditioners is increased. Accordingly, it is necessary to scrutinize the factors that influence the thermal comfort and indoor air quality that can be endured by the residents. In the current study, a review of the available literature on the thermal comfort and ventilation of the offices, classrooms and residential buildings in Malaysia and the surrounding regions was conducted. Additionally, prospective researches on different new cooling technologies were marked. Based on the findings, it concluded that thermal comfort range is higher than expected by international standards for hot-humid climate. It was also found that proper ventilation and healthy indoor air quality has great influence of sensation of thermal comfort via occupants of buildings. In point of fact, this work revealed that further research in these fields can provide a chance to improve thermal comfort and indoor air quality for occupants in hot and humid climate and minimize the energy consumption due to the application of air conditioner.
