Non-stationarities are inherent characteristics of the climate system and can be observed on different temporal and spatial scales. Non-stationarities in large-scale modes of climate variability of the Northern Hemisphere and the associated changes in the surface climate like modifications of the temperature and precipitation patterns are analysed. As major modes of climate variability the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon, the Pacific-North American pattern and the North Atlantic Oscillation are selected. The North Atlantic-European area is taken as an example to highlight non-stationarities in the atmospheric circulation and their impact on regional climate. The mechanisms and consequences of circulation-climate non-stationarities are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
