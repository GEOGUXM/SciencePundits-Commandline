Surface atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> mixing ratio reflects both natural fluctuation of the carbon cycle and the effect of anthropogenic activities. Long-term observation of atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> forms the basis for model simulations of the carbon cycle both in the straightforward and the inversion ways. Atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> has been measured on Rishiri Island (45.1°N, 141.2°E) in the western North Pacific since May 2006. We report the first 7-year temporal CO<inf>2</inf> variations from diurnal to inter-annual scales and the implications on the vegetation phenology. Diurnally, an obvious cycle appeared as a minimum in the afternoon and maximum at midnight in the summer months, caused by local vegetation. Seasonally, the maximum CO<inf>2</inf> concentration appeared around the beginning of April, while the minimum appeared around the middle of August. This seasonal variation implied the natural cycle of terrestrial biological activities of the boreal forest, mostly in the east Eurasia. A mean growing season length of ~126days was estimated. In the period from 2007 to 2012, the peak-to-peak amplitude increased until 2009 and decreased thereafter, with a mean value of 19.7ppm. Inter-annually, atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> is increasing by a mean growth rate of 2.1ppmyear-1. The study provides invaluable dataset and useful information to better understand the carbon cycle and its interaction with climate change. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
