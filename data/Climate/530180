The effects of urban green spaces on stormwater runoff have increasingly attracted attention because of climate change and rapid urbanization conditions. This study investigates the spatial-temporal changes of urban green spaces in Beijing and estimates their effects on rainwater runoff reduction based on an empirical model. Results indicate that green spaces in Beijing decreased by 199km2 from 2000 to 2010 and that landscape patches became increasingly isolated and fragmented. The volume of rainwater runoff controlled by urban green spaces first increased and then decreased with the increase in summer rainfall. The runoff reduction rate continuously decreased from 23% in 2000 to 17% in 2010, which is mainly attributed to the composition changes in urban green spaces. In addition, an immense regional difference that is closely related to the changes in the largest patch and aggregation indices of urban green spaces are observed in different regions. This study recommends an optimal landscape pattern of urban green spaces for the planning and management of green spaces in highly urbanized areas. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
