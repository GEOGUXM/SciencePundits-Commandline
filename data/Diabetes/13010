In human diabetic nephropathy, glomerular injury was found to comprise lipid droplets, suggesting that abnormal lipid metabolism might take place in the development of diabetic glomerular injury. However, its precise mechanism remains unclear. Fatty acid binding protein (FABP) is currently considered as a key molecule for lipid metabolism. Since diabetic eNOS knockout (KO) mouse is considered to be a good model for human diabetic nephropathy, we here investigated whether FABP could mediate glomerular injury in this model. We found that glomerular injuries were associated with inflammatory processes, such as macrophage infiltration and MCP-1 induction. Microarray assay with isolated glomeruli revealed that among 10 isoforms in FABP family, FABP3 mRNA was most highly expressed in diabetic eNOSKO mice compared to non-diabetic eNOSKO mice. FABP3 protein was found to be located in the mesangial cells. Overexpression of FABP3 resulted in a greater response to palmitate, a satulated FA, to induce MCP-1 in the rat mesangial cells. In turn, the heart, a major organ for FABP3 protein in normal condition, failed to alter its expression level under diabetic condition in either wild type or eNOSKO mice. In conclusion, FABP3 is induced in the mesangial cells and likely a mediator to induce MCP-1 in the diabetic nephropathy. Â© 2014 The Authors.
