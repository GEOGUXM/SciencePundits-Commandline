Oxidative stress occurs following the impairment of pro-oxidant/antioxidant balance in chronic wounds and leads to harmful delays in healing progress. A fine balance between oxidative stress and endogenous antioxidant defense system may be beneficial for wound healing under redox control. This study tested the hypothesis that oxidative stress in wound area can be controlled with systemic antioxidant therapy and therefore wound healing can be accelerated. We used chlorogenic acid (CGA), a dietary antioxidant, in experimental diabetic wounds that are characterized by delayed healing. Additionally, we aimed to understand possible side effects of CGA on pivotal organs and bone marrow during therapy. Wounds were created on backs of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. CGA (50 mg/kg/day) was injected intraperitoneally. Animals were sacrificed on different days. Biochemical and histopathological examinations were performed. Side effects of chronic antioxidant treatment were tested. CGA accelerated wound healing, enhanced hydroxyproline content, decreased malondialdehyde/nitric oxide levels, elevated reduced-glutathione, and did not affect superoxide dismutase/catalase levels in wound bed. While CGA induced side effects such as cyto/genotoxicity, 15 days of treatment attenuated blood glucose levels. CGA decreased lipid peroxidation levels of main organs. This study provides a better understanding for antioxidant intake on diabetic wound repair and possible pro-oxidative effects. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
