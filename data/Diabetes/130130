Objectives: While the prevalence of Group B streptococcus (GBS) colonization is important, little is known about invasive GBS (iGBS) disease in tropical areas. Our objective was to assess the burden of iGBS disease among non-pregnant adults. Methods: A prospective hospital-based study of all non-pregnant adult patients with iGBS disease was conducted between January and December 2011 in Saint Pierre, Réunion Island, to assess its cumulative incidence rate (CIR). Capsular serotyping and multilocus sequence typing were performed to characterize GBS isolates. Case-control study was done to identify risk factors. Results: The overall CIR of iGBS disease was 10.1 per 100,000. The CIR in elderly patients (≥ 65 yrs) was estimated at 40.6 per 100.000, and that of adults (15-64 years) at 6.7 per 100.000. Aboriginal origin in the Indian Ocean and overweight were both associated with iGBS disease. The most prominent clinical forms were osteo-articular and skin/soft tissue infections, as a consequence of diabetic foot. The serotypes were classic, type-Ia being the most prevalent. The hyper virulent ST-17 (CC17) was associated with type-III. Conclusions: The incidence of iGBS disease found in Réunion island is twofold that usually reported. This burden is linked to overweight in aboriginal people from the Indian Ocean. © 2015 The Authors.
