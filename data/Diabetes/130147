Body mass index has been found to be the second most important contributor to relative risk for developing end state renal disease (ESRD), after proteinuria. The impact of obesity on the kidney includes a wide spectrum, from characteristic pathologic lesions to increment in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and proteinuria/or decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The cause of renal disease associated to obesity is not well understood, but two relevant elements emerge. The first is the presence of obesity-related glomerulopathy, and the second is the fat deposit in the kidney with impact on renal haemodynamics and intrarenal regulation. The mechanisms linking obesity and renal damage are complex and include haemodynamic changes, inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and finally renal scarring. The protection of kidney damage needs to combine weight reduction with the proper control of the cardiometabolic risk factors associated, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and dyslipidaemia. The search for specific treatments merits future research. Â© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.
