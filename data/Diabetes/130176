Background: This study aims to describe trends in the rate of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and use of open surgery repair (OSR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in elderly patients with and without type 2 diabetes in Spain, 2003-2012. Methods: We select all patients with a discharge of AAA using national hospital discharge data. Discharges were grouped by diabetes status: type 2 diabetes and no diabetes. In both groups OSR and EVAR were identified. The incidence of discharges attributed to AAA were calculated overall and stratified by diabetes status and year. We calculated length of stay (LOHS) and in-hospital mortality (IHM). Use of OSR and EVAR were calculated stratified by diabetes status. Multivariate analysis was adjusted by age, sex, year, smoking habit and comorbidity. Results: From 2003 to 2012, 115,020 discharges with AAA were identified. The mean age was 74.91 years and 16.7% suffered type 2 diabetes. Rates of discharges due to AAA increased significantly in diabetic patients (50.09 in 2003 to 78.23 cases per 100,000 in 2012) and non diabetic subjects (69.24 to 78.66). The incidences were higher among those without than those with diabetes in all the years studied. Conclusions: Incidence rates were higher in non-diabetic patients. For diabetic and non diabetic patients the use of EVAR has increased and open repair seems to be decreasing. IHM and LOHS have improved from 2003 to 2012. Patients with diabetes had significantly lower mortality. © 2015 Lopez-de-Andrés et al.; licensee BioMed Central.
