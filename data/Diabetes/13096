Background: Both increased lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A<inf>2</inf> (Lp-PLA<inf>2</inf>) concentrations and atherogenic lipoprotein subfractions have been shown to reflect unfavourable cardiovascular risk. However, the correlation between Lp-PLA<inf>2</inf> and lipoprotein subfractions in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been assessed yet. Methods: A total of 324 consecutive subjects who were not treated with lipid-lowering drugs were enrolled (angiographically proven CAD: n=253; non-CAD: n=71). Plasma Lp-PLA<inf>2</inf> concentrations were measured using ELISA. The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subfractions were determined by Lipoprint System. Results: Plasma Lp-PLA<inf>2</inf> concentrations were higher in patients with CAD compared with those without CAD (153.61±78.73 vs. 131.41±65.49ng/ml, p=0.028). The univariable correlation analysis revealed that Lp-PLA<inf>2</inf> concentrations were positively correlated with the cholesterol concentrations of each LDL subfractions and the intermediate as well as small HDL subfractions, while negatively linked with the LDL particle size and large HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations in CAD group. However, no similar results were observed in the non-CAD group. Furthermore, multivariable regression analysis was performed in patients with CAD and showed that plasma Lp-PLA<inf>2</inf> concentrations were independently correlated with the cholesterol concentrations of each LDL subfractions [large LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C): β=0.263, p<0.001; intermediate LDL-C: β=0.327, p<0.001; small LDL-C: β=0.135, p=0.033] and small HDL-C (β=0.133, p=0.034). Conclusion: Lp-PLA<inf>2</inf> concentrations were positively associated with all LDL subfractions and small HDL subfraction, suggesting an interaction between Lp-PLA<inf>2</inf> and lipoprotein subfraction phenotypes in the status of CAD. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
