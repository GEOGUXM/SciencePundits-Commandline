Podocytes are highly specialized cells that wrap around glomerular capillaries and comprise a key component of the glomerular filtration barrier. They are uniquely sensitive to insulin; like skeletal muscle and fat cells, they exhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and express glucose transporters. Podocyte insulin signaling is mediated by protein kinase G type I (PKGI), and it leads to changes in glomerular permeability to albumin. Here, we investigated whether large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BK<inf>Ca</inf>) were involved in insulin-mediated, PKGIα-dependent filtration barrier permeability.Insulin-induced glomerular permeability was measured in glomeruli isolated from Wistar rats. Transepithelial albumin flux was measured in cultured rat podocyte monolayers. Expression of BK<inf>Ca</inf> subunits was detected by RT-PCR. BK<inf>Ca</inf>, PKGIα, and upstream protein expression were examined in podocytes with Western blotting and immunofluorescence. The BK<inf>Ca</inf>-PKGIα interaction was assessed with co-immunoprecipitation.RT-PCR showed that primary cultured rat podocytes expressed mRNAs that encoded the pore-forming α subunit and four accessory β subunits of BK<inf>Ca</inf>. The BK<inf>Ca</inf> inhibitor, iberiotoxin (ibTX), abolished insulin-dependent glomerular albumin permeability and PKGI-dependent transepithelial albumin flux. Insulin-evoked albumin permeability across podocyte monolayers was also blocked with BK<inf>Ca</inf> siRNA. Moreover, ibTX blocked insulin-induced disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and changes in the phosphorylation of PKG target proteins, MYPT1 and RhoA.These results indicated that insulin increased filtration barrier permeability through mobilization of BK<inf>Ca</inf> channels via PKGI in cultured rat podocytes. This molecular mechanism may explain podocyte injury and proteinuria in diabetes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
