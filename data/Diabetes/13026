Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and HDL dysfunction. We herein tested whether lowering HbA1c affects HDL-C and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Forty-two uncontrolled T2D patients initiating basal insulin were included. HbA1c, HDL-C and RCT were assessed at baseline and after 6 months. At baseline, HDL-C and RCT were directly correlated (r=0.50; p<0.001). After 6 months of insulin therapy, HbA1c dropped from 8.8±0.16% to 7.1±0.1%, while average HDL-C and RCT did not change. Follow-up HDL-C and RCT were still correlated (r=0.31; p=0.033) and δHDL-C correlated with δRCT (r=0.32; p=0.029). δHbA1c correlated with δHDL-C (r=0.43, p=0.001), but not with δRCT. In patients with δHbA1c above the median value (1.3%), HDL-C (but not RCT) increased significantly. In conclusion, glucose control correlates with increased HDL-C, but not with improved RCT. Thus, persistent HDL dysfunction despite improved HbA1c and HDL-C can contribute to residual cardiovascular risk in T2D. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
