The present study was designed to investigate the hypoglycemic activity and the potential mechanisms of Misgurnus anguillicaudatus polysaccharide (MAP) in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. MAP oral administration significantly decreased the blood levels of glucose, TC, TG, LDL-C, and increased the blood levels of HDL-C and insulin in diabetic mice, concurrent with increases in body weights and pancreatic insulin contents. Moreover, MAP reversed the increased mRNA expressions of PEPCK and the reduced glycogen contents in the liver of diabetic mice. Concurrently, MAP exhibited potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities, as evidenced by the decreased blood levels of TNF-α, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, MDA, and also the elevated SOD and GPx activities in the serum of diabetic mice. Furthermore, MAP also significantly improved the blood markers of the impaired liver function and renal function in diabetic mice. Altogether, these results suggest that MAP may be a potential therapeutic option for type 1 diabetes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
