Abstract Incretin therapies are effective in controlling blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetic patients by improving the survival and function of β-cells. They include dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs. We have previously reported that GLP-1 enhances the survival of cultured human islets by activation of the transcription factor CREB. To test the in vivo relevance of these findings, we examined the effects of alogliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, in Zucker Diabetic rats, a model for type 2 diabetes. The plasma levels of GLP-1 increased in alogliptin-treated diabetic rats leading to normoglycemia. Pancreatic islets of untreated diabetic rats were characterized by decreased immunostaining for insulin and PDX-1. Elevation of GLP-1 in treated diabetic rats resulted in the improved survival of β-cells. Dual immunofluorescent staining showed phosphorylation/activation of CREB in insulin-positive β-cells of islets. This led to increases in the levels of CREB targets including Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic mitochondrial protein, BIRC3, a caspase inhibitor and IRS-2, an adapter protein needed for insulin signaling. Findings from this study suggest potential activation of cytoprotective CREB by GLP-1 in pancreatic β-cells of diabetic patients undergoing incretin-based therapies.
