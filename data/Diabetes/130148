Objective: To quantify the prevalence of healthy excessive weight and determinants of metabolic profile, considering women's reproductive life. Methods: We evaluated 1847 mothers of a birth cohort assembled after delivery and reevaluated 4. years later. A healthy profile was defined as the absence of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, C-reactive protein <. 3. mg/l and being below the second tertile of HOMA-IR. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (95% CI) were computed using multinomial logistic regression, taking women with normal BMI as the reference category of the outcome. Results: Four years after delivery, 47% of women had normal BMI, 33% were overweight and 20% obese. In each BMI class, 61%, 33% and 12% presented a healthy metabolic profile, respectively. Family history of CVD/cardiometabolic risk factors was associated with a higher probability of obesity with a not healthy metabolic profile (OR = 1.39 95% CI: 0.98-1.98). Women who breastfed the enrolled child for >. 26. weeks and practiced physical exercise were less likely to be obese and metabolically unhealthy (OR = 0.39 95% CI: 0.23-0.68; OR = 0.48 95% CI: 0.33-0.70, respectively), with no effect on healthy excessive weight. Conclusions: These results support the existence of a healthy excessive weight phenotype in women after motherhood, influenced by anthropometrics, genetic and lifestyles characteristics.
