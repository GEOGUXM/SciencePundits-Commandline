Background: Hemoglobin A<inf>1c</inf> (HbA<inf>1c</inf>) is used to monitor long-term glycemic control in individuals with diabetes, guide therapy, predict the risk of microvascular complications, and more recently to diagnose diabetes. An automated liquid-flow capillary electrophoresis method was recently developed to measure HbA<inf>1c</inf> using the Capillarys 2 Flex Piercing instrument. Methods: Analytical evaluation was performed at 2 clinical centers. A clinical analysis was conducted in 109 African-born individuals, 24% of whom have variant hemoglobin (HbAS or HbAC). Abnormal glucose tolerance (which includes both diabetes and prediabetes) was defined as 2. h glucose of ≥. 140. mg/dl (7.8. mmol/l) during an oral glucose tolerance test. Results: Interlaboratory CVs were ≤2.1%. The method showed satisfactory correlation with 2 other analyzers that measure HbA<inf>1c</inf> by high-performance liquid chromatography. Neither labile HbA<inf>1c</inf>, carbamylated hemoglobin, uremia, bilirubin nor common hemoglobin variants (HbC/HbS/HbE) interfered. Forty-five individuals (41%) had abnormal glucose tolerance. The sensitivity of HbA<inf>1c</inf> for diagnosing abnormal glucose tolerance was 38%, 36% and 42% for total, normal and variant hemoglobin groups, respectively. Conclusions: The analytical performance of HbA<inf>1c</inf> on the Capillarys 2 is suitable for clinical application. Variant hemoglobin in Africans did not interfere with the detection of abnormal glucose tolerance by HbA<inf>1c</inf> measured on the Capillarys 2. © 2015.
