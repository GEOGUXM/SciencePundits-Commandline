Real-time glucose monitoring has been beneficial in reducing health complications associated with diabetes as well as a decrease in mortality. This report describes a novel holographic platform, fabricated via laser ablation on chitosan hydrogel with gold nanoparticles with a replaying in visible and near IR. The sensor responded with a 12. nm and 7. nm shift in wavelength at glucose concentrations in the 0-70. mM range and in the visible and near IR, respectively, at pH 7.4 and an ionic strength of 154. mM. The sensor did not respond to potential interferences found in the interstitial fluid, such as fructose, vitamin C and lactate, at their respective normal concentrations and was stable to fluctuations in temperature, pH and ionic strength. The characteristics of this sensor suggests that it may be applicable for use as an implanted device for the real time monitoring of glucose concentrations in the interstitial fluid using near IR as the interrogating medium.
