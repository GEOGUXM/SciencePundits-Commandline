Objective: Weight loss is important for prevention of type 2 diabetes and an accurate self-perceived body image can promote weight reduction. We evaluated the association of self-perceived body image with body mass index (BMI) and type 2 diabetes. Methods: Data from the Danish ADDITION-PRO cohort study (2009-2011) were used. A total of 2082 men and women attended a health examination including assessment of BMI, waist circumference, the Stunkard scale of self-perceived obesity and an oral glucose tolerance test for assessment of diabetes risk. Results: Mean (SD) age was 66.2 (6.9) years and 24% were obese (BMI ≥30kg/m2). However, only 7% of obese men and 11% of obese women perceived themselves as obese. Among obese women, for a given level of BMI and waist circumference, one unit higher self-perceived body image was associated with 52% (95% CI: 14-73) lower risk of having type 2 diabetes and 45% (95% CI: 12-65) lower risk of having pre-diabetes. Overweight, but not obese, men had a 35% (95% CI: 36-56) lower risk of type 2 diabetes per unit increase in body image. Conclusions: Obese individuals seem to underestimate their body shape. However, having a realistic body image (higher self-perceived obesity) is independently associated with lower diabetes risk. Self-perceived body image might serve as a valuable tool for type 2 diabetes risk assessment. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.
