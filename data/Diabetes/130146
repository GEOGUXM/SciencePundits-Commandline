Recent decades have witnessed a sharp increase in the incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. One antidiabetic therapeutic approach is to reduce gastrointestinal glucose production and absorption through the inhibition of carbohydrate-digesting enzymes such as α-amylase and α-glucosidase. In this study, crude extracts and their corresponding fractions of flowers, fruits, (stems and leaves) and roots of the endemic North African plant Scabiosa arenaria Forssk. were screened for their ability of α-glucosidase inhibition. It was found that the fruits ethyl acetate (EtOAc), the fruits butanolic (n-BuOH) and the flowers ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fractions inhibited α-glucosidase in a non competitive manner with IC<inf>50</inf> values of 0.11±0.09, 0.28±0.04 and 0.221±0.01mg/ml, respectively. RP-HPLC analysis indicated that the major components of these active fractions are flavonoid aglycone, cinnamic acid and its derivatives. This result supports the conclusion that the three studied fractions could be a useful natural source for the development of a novel α-glucosidase inhibitory agent against diabetic complications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
