The most recent guideline statements by the 2014 Expert Panel of the National Institutes of Health as well as the American and International Societies of Hypertension recommend a blood pressure goal of <140/90 mmHg in patients with diabetes mellitus. This follows prior guidelines that recommended lower BP treatment goals of <130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes. Reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality by trying to achieve recommended goals of risk factors like blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol in patients with diabetes is paramount. Data from multiple trials demonstrates that early treatment of hypertension in people with diabetes clearly prevents both macrovascular and microvascular complications, but the goal blood pressure that should be achieved is now modified to a higher level. We address the evidence and evolution of how and why this blood pressure goal has changed in recent years. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.
