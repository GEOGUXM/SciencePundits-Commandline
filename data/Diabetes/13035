Health conditions may greatly modify the association between particulate matter (PM) and heart rate variability (HRV), but whether the modification of PM effect by coronary artery disease (CAD) risk status depends on the PM levels remains unknown. We investigated the associations between personal exposures to PM with aerodynamic diameter of ≤10μm (PM<inf>10</inf>) and ≤2.5μm (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and concurrent HRV, and whether the effect of PM on HRV was modified by Framingham risk score (FRS) in healthy subjects with different PM exposure levels. Personal exposures to PM<inf>10</inf> and PM<inf>2.5</inf> were measured for 24h in 152 volunteers of community residents who were free of cardiovascular disease in two cities (Zhuhai and Wuhan) that differ in air quality. Simultaneously, 24h HRV indices were obtained from 3-channel Holter monitor. FRS was calculated based on age, sex, lipid profiles, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking status. Linear regression models were constructed after adjusting for potential confounders. We found significant decrease in total power (TP) and low power (LF) with increased PM<inf>10</inf> concentrations (P for trend<0.05) in the high PM levels city (Wuhan) and total population, but not in the low PM levels city (Zhuhai). We also observed significant modification of FRS on PM<inf>10</inf> effect in Wuhan. Interestingly, elevated PM<inf>10</inf> was associated in a greater decreased HRV in the low FRS subgroup, but not in the high FRS subgroup. However, we did not find any significant main effects of PM<inf>2.5</inf> or PM<inf>2.5</inf>-FRS interactions on HRV in city-specified or city-combined analyses. Overall, the findings indicate that individual coronary risk profiles may modulate the association between particulate air pollution and HRV in high PM exposure levels. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
