The enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-IV) is recognized to be a promising target for the management of type 2 diabetes. Over the last decade, numerous synthetic molecules and more recently, peptides from dietary proteins, have been reported to be able to inhibit DPP-IV activity. Most studies that have investigated the in vitro effect of these inhibitors have used porcine or human DPP-IV. Although structurally alike, it is unclear whether these two species display similar inhibition patterns. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the effects of protein-derived peptides on the activity of porcine and recombinant human DPP-IV. The two species showed different inhibition susceptibility to 43 of the 62 peptide sequences investigated. While 37 protein-derived peptides were more effective at inhibiting the porcine DPP-IV, only six caused a stronger inhibition of the activity of the human enzyme. Although the peptides WR, IPIQY and WCKDDQNPHS were found to be among the most potent inhibitors of both species, the inhibitory effect was greater on the porcine enzyme than on human DPP-IV (αK<inf>i</inf> or K<inf>i</inf> = 11.5, 13.4, 13.3 μM and 31.4, 28.2, 75.0 μM for porcine and human DPP-IV, respectively). Investigation into the mode of action of the most effective inhibitory peptides revealed that both species were inhibited in a similar manner by short fragments (≤5 amino acid residues), but that some of the longer peptides acted differently on the enzymes. This study shows that porcine DPP-IV is generally inhibited with greater potency by protein-derived peptides than is the human enzyme. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.
