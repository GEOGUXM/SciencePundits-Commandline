Synthetic biology makes inroads into clinical therapy with the debut of closed-loop prosthetic gene networks specifically designed to treat human diseases. Prosthetic networks are synthetic sensor/effector devices that could functionally integrate and interface with host metabolism to monitor disease states and coordinate appropriate therapeutic responses in a self-sufficient, timely and automatic manner. Prosthetic networks hold particular promise for the current global epidemic of closely interrelated metabolic disorders encompassing obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, which arise from the unhealthy lifestyle and dietary factors in the modern urbanised world. This review will critically examine the various attempts at constructing prosthetic gene networks for the treatment of these metabolic disorders, as well as provide insight into future developments in the field.
