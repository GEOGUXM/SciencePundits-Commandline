Insulin resistance is a hallmark of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Increased plasma FFA level is an important cause of obesity-associated insulin resistance. Over-activated ERK is closely related with FFA release from adipose tissues in patients with type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, there are no effective strategies to lower plasma FFA level. Low-power laser irradiation (LPLI) has been reported to regulate multiple biological processes. However, whether LPLI could ameliorate metabolic disorders and the molecular mechanisms involved remain unknown. In this study, we first demonstrated that LPLI suppresses excessive lipolysis of insulin-resistant adipocytes by activating tyrosine kinases-1(Dok1)/ERK/PPARγ pathway. Our data showed that LPLI inhibits ERK phosphorylation through the activation of Dok1, resulting in decreased phospho-PPARγ level. Non-phosphorylated PPARγ maintains in nucleus to promote the expression of adipogenic genes, reversing excessive lipolysis in insulin-resistant adipocytes. In summary, the present research highlights the important roles of Dok1/ERK/PPARγ pathway in lowering FFA release from adipocytes, and our research extends the knowledge of the biological effects induced by LPLI. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.
