With the advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology the interest of researchers has expanded to interdisciplinary domain like bio-medical applications. Among such domains, one of the most important areas explored meticulously is the development of promising solutions in diabetes therapeutics. The disease associated with metabolic disorder, is one of the major challenges, due to its ever-increasing number of patients. The adverse effects of the synthetic enzymes like - amylase and - glucosidase inhibitors have invited many scientists to develop promising contender with minimal side-effects. On the other hand, Zinc has strong role in insulin synthesis, storage and secretion and thus its deficiency can be related to diabetes. In this context we have explored natural extract of Red Sandalwood (RSW) as a potent anti-diabetic agent, in conjugation with ZnO nanoparticles. ZnO nanoparticles have been synthesized via soft chemistry routes and duly characterized for their phase formation with the help of X-ray diffraction technique and Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy. These monodispersed nanoparticles, ∼20 nm in size, were further conjugated to RSW extract. The conjugation chemistry was studied via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, UVvisible spectroscopy. Extract loading percentage was found from thermo-gravimetric analysis. 65% of the RSW extract was found conjugated to the ZnO nanoparticles. The anti-diabetic activity was assessed with the help of like-α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition assay with murine pancreatic and small intestinal extracts. It was observed that the conjugated ZnO-RSW nanoparticles showed excellent activity against the crude murine pancreatic glucosidase as compared to the individual ZnO nanoparticles and the RSW extract. The ZnO-RSWconjugate showed 61.93% of inhibition while the bare ZnO nanoparticles and RSW showed 21.48% and 5.90% respectively. © 2015 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.
