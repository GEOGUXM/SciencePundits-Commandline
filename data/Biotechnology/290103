Stability of recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is essential for their clinical application. The presence of the two degradation hotspots, namely, LC-Asn30 and HC-Asp102, in its complementary determinant regions prevents trastuzumab (Herceptin®) from being supplied in a drug product format of liquid formulation. To improve the stability, a new antibody was created by replacing the two residues with chemically similar amino acids of LC-Gln30 and HC-Glu102. This new mAb, named as T-mAb2, exhibited a simple and more uniform charge heterogeneity profile than T-mAb1, which is trastuzumab made in our laboratory, as displayed by the difference between their main peak area percentages (82.9% for T-mAb2 vs. 60.5% for T-mAb1). Computer modeling results, physicochemical and biological characterization, and stability profiling studies on T-mAb2 and T-mAb1 demonstrated that stability of T-mAb2 was significantly improved. In comparison with T-mAb1, although its in vitro human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-target binding activities were reduced slightly, in vivo tumor growth inhibiting activity was not affected, as demonstrated by the study results using the SKOV3 xenograft mouse model. Hence, a new anti-HER2 antibody was generated with improved stability that could be used to produce the drug product in liquid formulation for cost saving and more convenient usage. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.
