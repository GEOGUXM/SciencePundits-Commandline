Lophira lanceolata seeds are used by Waama ethnic people in Benin to extract oils. We aimed to evaluate the chemical profiles (fatty acids, tocols and sterols) of the oil obtained following the ancestral process. Two extraction methods (enzymes-assisted aqueous extraction) and organic solvent method, were used to compare the oil properties. The impact of the roasting of seeds in ancestral process was also evaluated. The oil obtained following the ancestral process has shown good chemical parameters with brilliant colors. Results also revealed that all oils are rich in polyunsaturated fatted acids with α-linoleic (>30% w/w) and arachidonic (>14% w/w) acids as majors. Enzymes and roasting of the seeds induced lauric, eicosapentaenoic and adrenic acids formations in oils. The presence of tocols and phytosterols, determined by LC-MS/APCI+, may explain the therapeutic use of these oils in rural area. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
