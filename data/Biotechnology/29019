A transgenic bacterium Bacillus cereus BW-03(<inf>p</inf>PW-05) was constructed by transforming a plasmid harbouring mer operon of a marine bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis PW-05 into another mercury resistant marine bacterium B.cereus BW-03 with mercury biosorption capability. The transformant was able to remove >99% of mercury supplement in-vitro by simultaneous volatilization (>53%) and biosorption (~40%). Encapsulation of the transformant increased its mercury removal potential to almost 100%. Additionally, B.cereus BW-03(<inf>p</inf>PW-05) could resist wide variations of salinity (5-30ppt), pH (Brierley etal., 1989; Chung etal., 1989; Chen and Wilson, 1997; Chakraborty and Das, 2014) and mercury (5-50ppm) and survived in mercury contaminated simulated environment up to 7 days. -SH and -COOH groups were possibly involved for mercury biosorption under laboratory conditions. The potential for application of this transgenic bacterium for in-situ bioremediation was demonstrated in a microcosm experiment, where it removed 96.4% inorganic mercury synergistically with the normal microbiota.
