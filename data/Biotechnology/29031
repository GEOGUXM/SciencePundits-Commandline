Olive stones (OS) are an abundant industrial by-product in countries of the Mediterranean Basin. In this work, olive stones were pretreated with hot water (autohydrolysis) at temperatures ranging from 150°C to 225°C for 0-600s, and results were analyzed by using the severity factor (log R0). A log R0 value equal to 3.7 guaranteed the total solubilization of hemicelluloses, largely preserving cellulose and lignin in solid residue. In the prehydrolyzate, high oligosaccharide yield (14.7kg/100kg OS) and low acetic acid yield (0.24kg/100kg OS) were achieved at 190°C and 300s (log R0=3.59). The solid residues were hydrolyzed by cellulases to assess the enzymatic digestibility. Results showed that enzymatic saccharification of pretreated solids at 225°C for 600s resulted in d-glucose yield of 54.3% (12.6kg/100kg OS), which improved 28-fold the yield obtained by using solids pretreated at 150°C for 600s. Mercury porosimetry illustrated that this increase could be explained by changes in average pore diameters rather than by changes in specific surface areas. The results demonstrated that olive stones are a potential raw material for the production of fermentable sugars. In the best operating conditions tested, autohydrolysis and subsequent enzymatic process have allowed the achievement of very high yields in oligosaccharides and d-glucose, respectively. Considering the autohydrolysis and enzymatic process, the total production of fermentable sugars leads to a total yield of 27.3kg/100kg OS. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
