There is currently a growing interest of the industry to replace synthetic products by natural ones with bioactive properties. The aim of this work is the phytochemical analysis of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities of Lantana camara and Lantana montevidensis. ethanolic extracts. Folin-Ciocalteu and aluminum chloride methods were used for the analysis of the phenolic compounds, checking higher concentrations in the extracts of the leaves of both species. Phenolic compounds such as quercetin, rutin, gallic acid, chlorogenicacid and caffeic acid were identified and quantified by HPLC-DAD. Antioxidant activity of these species was determined using assay systems: inhibition of production of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), iron-chelating activity, deoxyribose degradation and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). The ethanolic extracts exhibited more antioxidant activity recording major activities in TBARS and FRAP, being more effective extracts of leaves toward the root extracts. The results suggest the potential use of L. camara and L. montevidensis for the treatment of several diseases due to its ability to act as an antioxidant. Â© 2015.
