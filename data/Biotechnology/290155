Mass production of graphene with low cost and excellent properties is essential for its practical applications in energy, composites, biotechnology, and electronics. Here for the first time we demonstrate that graphite powder can be efficiently exfoliated into monolayered and few-layered nanosheets based on the driving forces originating from the phase inversion, i.e., from micelles to reverse micelles in the emulsion microenvironment built by supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO<inf>2</inf>). A series of surfactants have been studied, and the experimental results indicate that efficient exfoliation of graphene depends on the suitable surfactant chosen in the SC CO<inf>2</inf> solution system. In this work, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is confirmed to be an excellent surfactant to play the critical role on exfoliation of graphite, which leads to a high-yield graphene nanosheets (87.7%, ≤3 layers) with concentration of 1.93 mg/mL, large lateral size (up to 5 μm) and low oxidation degree (a C/O ratio of 20.28). And the dispersible graphene can be ink-brushed on A4-size paper to form highly conductive films (2.41 Ω s q-1), which confirms that our exfoliation method remains the integrity of the perfect structure in graphene to the largest extent. Further, the exfoliated graphene was used to prepare electrospun graphene-beaded carbon fibers for supercapacitors. The obtained materials deliver a high specific capacitance of 371.25 F/g, which is 71.6% higher than that of the pristine carbon fibers, and exhibit an excellent rate performance. Thus, this strategy utilizing reverse-micelle-induced method for exfoliation of graphite to graphene can pave a way for the green solution-processable production of more two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets, which will have great application potential on electronic, biotechnology, energy, and information storage, etc. © 2015 American Chemical Society.
