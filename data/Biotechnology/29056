The current communication reports the development of a single-stage biosystem for biohythane production from wastewater treatment. A semi-pilot scale bioreactor with 34L capacity was used for this study. Maximum biohythane production of 147.5±2.4L was observed after five cycles of operation with production rate of 4.7±0.1L/h. The biohythane composition (H<inf>2</inf>/(H<inf>2</inf>+CH<inf>4</inf>)) varied from 0.60 to 0.23 during stabilized fifth cycle of operation. During each cycle of operation, higher H<inf>2</inf> fraction was noticed within 12h of cycle period followed by CH<inf>4</inf> production for rest of operation (36h). During biohythane production, COD removal efficiency of 60±5% (SDR, 29.0±1.9kg COD<inf>r</inf>/m3-day) was also achieved. The synergistic function of volatile fatty acids (VFA) production and consumption during process in hybrid biosystem played vital role on the composition of biohythane. The single-stage biosystem facilitates production of high valued and cost efficient biofuel (biohythane) with fewer controls than individual acidogenic and methanogenic processes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
