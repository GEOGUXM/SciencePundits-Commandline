Anaerobic digestion is a sustainable technology for the treatment of organic waste and production of biogas. Acetoclastic methanogenesis accounts for the majority of methane production in anaerobic digestion. Therefore, sustaining robust acetoclastic methanogens is important for stable process performance. Due to faster growth kinetics at high acetate concentrations, it has been considered that Methanosarcina would be more prevalent than Methanosaeta in unstable anaerobic digestion processes which frequently experience high acetate levels. Methanogen population dynamics were monitored in multiple continuous anaerobic digesters for 500 days. Results from quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis show that Methanosaeta dominated over Methanosarcina in anaerobic digestion at high acetate levels up to 44 mM, suggesting the potential of Methanosaeta as a robust and efficient acetoclastic candidate for resilient anaerobic methane conversion. Further efforts are needed to identify mechanisms contributing to the unexpected competitiveness of these methanogens at high acetate levels observed in this study.
