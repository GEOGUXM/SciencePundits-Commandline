Over the last two decades, the study of miRNAs has attracted tremendous attention since they regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and have been demonstrated to be dysregulated in many diseases. Detection methods with higher sensitivity, specificity and selectivity between precursors and mature microRNAs are urgently needed and widely studied. This review gave an overview of the amplification-based technologies including traditional methods, current modified methods and the cross-platforms of them combined with other techniques. Many progresses were found in the modified amplification-based microRNA detection methods, while traditional platforms could not be replaced until now. Several sample-specific normalizers had been validated, suggesting that the different normalizers should be established for different sample types and the combination of several normalizers might be more appropriate than a single universal normalizer. This systematic overview would be useful to provide comprehensive information for subsequent related studies and could reduce the un-necessary repetition in the future. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
