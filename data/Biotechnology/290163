Gluconobacter oxydans is capable of rapidly incomplete oxidation of many sugars and alcohols, which means the strain has great potential for industrial purposes. Strong promoters are one of the essential factors that can improve strain performance by overexpression of specific genes. In this study, a pipeline for screening strong promoters by proteomics analysis was established. Based on the procedure, a new strong promoter designated as P<inf>B932_2000</inf> was identified in G. oxydans WSH-003. The promoter region was characterized based on known genome sequence information using BPROM. The strength of P<inf>B932_2000</inf> was further assessed by analysis of enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) expression and comparison with egfp expression by two commonly used strong promoters, P<inf>E. coli_tufB</inf> and P<inf>G. oxydans_tufB</inf>. Both quantitative real-time PCR and fluorescence intensities for egfp gene expression showed that P<inf>B932_2000</inf> promoter is stronger than the other two. Overexpression of d-sorbitol dehydrogenase (sldh) by P<inf>B932_2000</inf> in G. oxydans WSH-003 enhanced the titer and productivity of l-sorbose synthesis from d-sorbitol by 12.0 % and 33.3 %, respectively. These results showed that proteomics analysis is an efficient way to identify strong promoters. The isolated promoter P<inf>B932_2000</inf> could further facilitate the metabolic engineering of G. oxydans. Â© 2015 Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology
