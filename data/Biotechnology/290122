The use of sugarcane bagasse hydrolyzate as a carbon source for enhanced oil production by activated sludge microbial cultures was investigated. Cultivation of raw activated sludge inoculum using pure xylose as carbon source was necessary prior to bagasse hydrolyzate feeding for microbial acclimation to this pentose sugar, the major component of the hydrolyzate. Lipid contents from 40 to 47% (dry cell weight) were achieved under high C:N ratio following bagasse hydrolyzate feeding; however nutrient supplementation was found to be necessary in order to maintain viable cell biomass levels (&gt;10g/L) to achieve a high lipid titer (7.62g/L). Hence, a process involving sequential batch feeding of hydrolyzate with and without nutrients was proposed and simulated using the Logistic and Luedeking-Piret models. Analysis of the product lipids showed up to 50% saponifiable fractions and dominance of C16 and C18 fatty acids, demonstrating their suitability as biofuel feedstock. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
