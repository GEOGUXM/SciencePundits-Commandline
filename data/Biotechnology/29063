As a result of the growing environmental awareness (e.g., increased pollution, increasing demand for biodegradable materials, material need for CO<inf>2</inf> neutrality and low greenhouse gas emissions, new environmental laws and regulations), manufacturers and scientists are keen to study novel environmental friendly materials. Soy protein isolate (SPI), a protein with reproducible resource, good biocompatibility, biodegradability and processability has a significant potential in the food industry, agriculture, bioscience and biotechnology. The aim of this review is to offer a comprehensive view of the recent state of art of eco-materials based on Soy Protein Isolate (SPI) with special reference to organic and inorganic fillers in the macro, micro and nano scale. Moreover, some applications of SPI-based materials, especially in the field of food preservation and packaging technology, are also discussed. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
