Biotechnology dates back to the beginnings of the history of the modern humans. They have discovered that bacteria and fungi convert or preserve food, or produce medical drugs (such as antibiotics). Modern biotechnology is divided into the areas of medicine, agriculture and industry. The plant biotechnology began with cell and tissue culture, and nowadays is associated with the transfer of foreign genes into plants, also known as ‘green gene technology’. The first generation of genetically modified (transgenic) plants was investigated with respect to integration, expression and inheritance of the foreign genes, while the second generation already comprised economically important characteristics such as herbicide, drought and salt tolerance, insect resistance, and growth properties. With the third generation of transgenic plants, methodological optimisations as well latest ecological and environmental issues were picked-up. How can plants more efficiently use the increasingly scarce nutrients? How can they be made fit for the forthcoming climate change? Can plants form oil-based raw materials? Are plants able to produce recyclable or compostable bioplastics? Can plants serve as bioreactors or bio-factories for the cost-effective production of biofuels, pharmaceuticals and medicines? New developments in molecular genetics and genome sequencing techniques offer a prospective for improved production of food crops (next generation plant biotechnology). © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg
