The replacement of diesel by biofuels is considered unrealistic because of the land used to produce their feedstock. One appointed solution is the use of algae which have higher productivity per unit area when compared with other feedstocks. In light of this, the total area, including water and land required for the European Union (EU), the United States (US), and Brazil was determined using international policies and targets, the present and future diesel demand, the current biodiesel production (released by international organizations), and specific data of algae productivity from the literature.GIS software was used to locate possible cities where algae cultivation could occur nearby. Bearings on the availability of area (flat and unoccupied zones), favourable climate, proximity to the process inputs (such as nutrients (preferably from municipal waste water treatment), CO2 and water sources) and political boundaries were used as assessment criteria. It was possible to identify seven suitable cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants in the EU, two in the USA and thirteen in Brazil.It was also shown that it is possible to attain targets required by current policies and replace diesel with algae-derived diesel based on attainable cultivation areas.
