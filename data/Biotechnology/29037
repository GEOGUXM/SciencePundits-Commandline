The present study has been focused on the extraction of natural dyes from Curcuma longa, Trigonella foenum graecum and Nerium oleander and investigation of their phytochemical and pharmacological characteristics. Dyes were prepared using aqueous, acidic, alcoholic and alkaline extraction techniques. UV spectral studies of the dyes showed a variation in absorption maxima and their color varied with respect to the pH and the solvent used during extraction. The dyes prepared from turmeric using aqueous extraction technique and from fenugreek using alkaline extraction showed good antibacterial activity. The aqueous and alcoholic extraction of Nerium oleander was able to inhibit the growth of many fungal strains including Tricoderma spp., Tricophyton rubrum, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium spp. etc. The antimicrobial property of the dyes was used in developing antimicrobial fabric.
