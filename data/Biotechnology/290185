The increased loads of antibiotics and heavy metals in sewage lead to bacterial cells acquiring resistance to both heavy metals and antibiotics. Therefore, these bacteria can play an important role for removal of pollutants from sewage. The utilization of the microbial processes such as biosorption and enzymatic biodegradation processes has increased during the recent years. These processes are significantly inexpensive and eco-friendly. Enzymatic techniques known as white biotechnology have the ability to degrade complex compounds. Hence, these can be applied to industrial processes. In the current review, the removal of heavy metals and antibiotics from treated sewage effluents by heavy metal/antibiotic-resistant bacteria will be discussed.
