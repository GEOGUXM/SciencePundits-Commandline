The cyanobacterial diversity in crude-oil-contaminated mats and soil sediments from the Guwahati refinery, in Guwahati, India, was studied using a polyphasic approach. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of the isolated cyanobacterial strains and of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis bands of the environmental samples revealed dominance of the genera Leptolyngbya and Planktothrix and the presence of Tolypothrix sp., Anabaena sp., Oscillatoriales sp., and Arthronema sp. These strains exhibited wide variation in their transferase glutamine synthetase activity and ammonia excretion activity. Treatment of isolates with hydrocarbon sludge caused a sharp decrease in photosynthetic oxygen evolution activity followed by time-dependent recovery, which ranged from 18.6% to 153.1% after 4h. The CO<inf>2</inf> evolution activity remained unaffected or exhibited stimulation after 1% or 2% oil sludge treatment. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
