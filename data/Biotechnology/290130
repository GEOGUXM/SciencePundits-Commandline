Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) produces carbon-rich nano-micro size particles. In this study, magnetic hydrochar (MHC) was prepared from model compound cellulose by simply adding ferrites during HTC. The effects of ferrites on HTC were evaluated by characterizing solid MHC and corresponding process liquid. Additionally, magnetic stability of MHC was tested by magnetic susceptibility method. Finally, MHC was used as support media for anaerobic films in anaerobic digestion (AD). Ash-free mass yield was around 50% less in MHC than hydrochar produced without ferrites at any certain HTC reaction condition, where organic part of MHC is mainly carbon. In fact, amorphous hydrochar was growing on the surface of inorganic ferrites. MHC maintained magnetic susceptibility regardless of reaction time at reaction temperature 250. °C. Pronounced inhibitory effects of magnetic hydrochar occurred during start-up of AD but diminished with prolong AD times. Visible biofilms were observed on the MHC by laser scanning microscope after AD. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
