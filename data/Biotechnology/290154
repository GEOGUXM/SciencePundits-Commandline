The need for smart materials in the area of biotechnology has fueled the development of numerous stimuli-responsive polymers. Many of these polymers are responsive to pH, light, temperature, or oxidative stress, and yet very few are responsive toward multiple stimuli. Here we report on the synthesis of a novel dual-stimuli-responsive poly(ethylene glycol)-based polymer capable of changing its hydrophilic properties upon treatment with UV light (exogenous stimulus) and markers of oxidative stress (endogenous stimulus). From this polymer, smart microparticles and fibers were fabricated and their responses to either stimulus separately and in conjunction were examined. Comparison of the degradation kinetics demonstrated that the polymer became water-soluble only after both oxidation and irradiation with UV light, which resulted in selective degradation of the corresponding particles. Furthermore, in vitro experiments demonstrated successful uptake of these particles by Raw 264.7 cells. Such dual-stimuli-responsive particles could have potential applications in drug delivery, imaging, and tissue engineering. Â© 2015 American Chemical Society.
