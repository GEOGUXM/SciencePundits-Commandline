The functionality and stability of phycobiliproteins (PBPs) phycoerythrin (PE), phycocyanin (PC) and allophycocyanin (APC) were investigated under various temperatures, pHs and oxidative stressors. All PBPs were thermostable up to 4-40°C; however, their concentration decreased rapidly at 60-80°C. The maximum stability of all PBPs was in the pH range 6.0-7.0. Decrease in PBPs content was found under high acidic (pH 2-4) and alkaline conditions (pH 8-12). The oxidizing agent (0.1-0.6%) showed the least effect on the stability of PBPs; however, 0.8-1.0% H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> caused significant loss of PBPs. Contrary to PE, PC and APC was more susceptible to an oxidizing agent. The chromophore associated with α- and β-subunit of PBPs and thus, their functionality (fluorescence) was severely affected under high temperature (60-80°C), and oxidizing agent, as well as low (2-4) and high (8-12) pH. Contrary to PC and APC, functionality of PE was surprisingly maintained even at pHs 6-12 and under oxidative stress. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
