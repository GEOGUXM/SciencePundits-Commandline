Cereus peruvianus Mill. is a cactus species that belongs to the family Cactaceae, popularly known as "Mandacaru". It presents several pharmacological activities in popular medicine. Its extract is used to reduce total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and consequently reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. It also has antineoplastic actions related to the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The in vitro tissue culture of C. peruvianus occurs under controlled environmental conditions, is independent of climatic or soil changes, and is free from microorganism and insect contamination. These advantages make it a sustainable biotechnology alternative to achieve specific metabolites, such as fatty acids. Tissue culture lipids were extracted from maceration and separated into neutral lipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids by column chromatography. The analysis of these fractions by gas chromatography and 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that the cell cultures had high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, such as ω-3, ω-6, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. Biologic assays were used to investigate potential antitumor activity using the sulforhodamine B method, and we observed a 50% cytotoxic concentration of 250μg/ml. The results contribute to knowledge about the lipid profile and antitumor activity of callus cultures of C. peruvianus. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
