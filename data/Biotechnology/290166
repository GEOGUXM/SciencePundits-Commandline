The oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica has become a recognized system for expression/secretion of heterologous proteins. This non-conventional yeast is currently being developed as a workhorse for biotechnology by several research groups throughout the world, especially for single-cell oil production, whole cell bioconversion and upgrading of industrial wastes. This mini-review presents established tools for protein expression in Y. lipolytica and highlights novel developments in the areas of promoter design, surface display, and host strain or metabolic pathway engineering. An overview of the industrial and commercial biotechnological applications of Y. lipolytica is also presented. Â© 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg
