This study evaluated the performance of a continuous flow structured-bed reactor in the simultaneous removal of total nitrogen (TN) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the effluent from an animal food plant. The reactor had an intermittent aeration system; hydraulic retention time (HRT) of one day; temperature of 30°C; and recirculation ratio of five times the flow. An experimental central composite rotational delineation (CCRD) type design was used to define the aeration conditions and nitrogen load (factors) to be studied. Response surface methodology was used to analyse the influence of the factors above the results, the removal of TN and COD. It was observed that the aeration factor showed the greatest significance for the results and that the affluent TKN concentration did not have a significant effect, at a 95% level of confidence, on COD removal. Throughout the experiment, the COD/N ratio remained between 3.2 and 3.8. The best results for COD and TN removal, 80% and 88%, respectively, were obtained with 158min of aeration on a cycle of 180min and 255mgL-1 of Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) in the substrate. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
