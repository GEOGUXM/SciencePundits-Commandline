The present study was conducted to explicit antioxidant and free radical scavenging potency of the methanolic leaf extract of Cinnamomum iners and screen the chemical composition using GC-MS. The total phenolic content, total flavonoid content and total anti-oxidant content of C. iners were 7.434±0.04mg TAE/g DW, 3.2±0.12μg QE/g DW and 119.412±0.39mg TAE/g DW, respectively. DPPH free radical scavenging activity of methanolic leaf extract recorded the IC50 value at the concentration of 15μg/ml. Among various antioxidant assays performed, maximum inhibition occurred in ABTS assay (99.36%) followed by TBA (95.39%) and FTC (81.37%). A total of six compounds, i.e., 4-piperidineacetic acid, 1-acetyl-5-ethyl-2-[3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1H-indol-2-yl]-a-methyl-methyl ester; pentadecanoic acid, 14-methyl-, methyl ester; 10-octadecenoic acid, methyl ester; cyclopropanebutanoic acid, 2-[[2-[[2-[(pentylcyclopropyl) methyl]cyclopropyl]methyl]cyclopropyl]methyl]-, methyl ester; cyclopentaneundecanoic acid, methyl ester; and oxiraneundecanoic acid, 3-pentyl-, methyl ester, cis- was detected using GC-MS. The study proves that the plant can be potentially used as an antioxidant agent in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.
