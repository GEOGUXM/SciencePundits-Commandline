Vegetable oils are essential for human and animal diets and have been used for industrial applications such as cosmetics and lubricants. Camelina sativa, which contains 35–45 % storage oils of seed dry weight, is an emerging oilseed crop. In addition, Arabidopsis WRINKLED1 (AtWRI1) is known to be an AP2/EREBP-type transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes that encode enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway and fatty acid synthesis. In this study, AtWRI1 was expressed in C. sativa under the control of the seed-specific SiW6 promoter. The introduction of the AtWRI1 gene was identified from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using genomic DNA, and its mRNA expression was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using gene-specific primers in transgenic C. sativa plants. The expression of AtWRI1 caused an increase of seed mass through an increase in size, but not through an increase in number of cells. Moreover, the total seed oil contents increased by approximately 14 % in the T3 transgenic C. sativa lines compared with the non-transgenic plants. It was revealed that the elevation in storage oil contents is caused by the upregulation of three isoforms encoding a pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α subunit and three isoforms encoding a biotin carboxyl carrier protein of acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex, which are involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. Finally, the increased expression levels of C. sativa expansin1, which may be involved in cell-wall loosening during cell expansion, was observed in transgenic C. sativa developing seeds. Transgenic C. sativa with enhanced seed oil contents will be useful for the production of non-petroleum-based biomaterials and biofuels. © 2015 Korean Society for Plant Biotechnology and Springer Japan
