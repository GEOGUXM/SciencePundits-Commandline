The chemical composition of the lipophilic extracts of the stems and grains of the shrub Retama sphaerocarpa was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the first time. Fatty acids is the major family of compounds in both morphological parts, representing between 37.1 and 85.1% of the total compounds detected, followed by sterols in stems and monoglycerides in grains. Considerable amounts of the alkaloids retamine (9.6gkg-1 of dry material) and cytisine (0.6gkg-1 of dry material) were also found in stems and grains, respectively. Before alkaline hydrolysis octadec-9-enoic (0.7-2.4gkg-1 of dry material), octadeca-9,12-dienoic (1.5-2.9gkg-1 of dry material) and hexadecanoic (1.1-2.0gkg-1 of dry material) acids are the most abundant lipophilic components in both morphological parts. After alkaline hydrolysis the contents of octade-9-enoic, octadeca-9,12-dienoic and octadeca-9,12,15-trienoic acids detected increased considerably ranging from 1.9 to 22.4, 3.6 to 40.1 and 0 to 8.6gkg-1 of dry material, respectively. Smaller amounts of long-chain aliphatic alcohols, α-tocopherol and β-amyrin were also found. These data indicates that R. sphaerocarpa stems and grains are a potential source of valuable phytochemicals, with recognized nutritional and phytopharmaceutical applications. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
