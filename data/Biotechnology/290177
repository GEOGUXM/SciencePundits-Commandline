High-throughput and high clinical relevance methods are demanded to predict the drug-induced cardiotoxicity in pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to effectively decrease late-stage drug attrition. In this study, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) were integrated into an interdigital impedance sensor array to fabricate a high performance iPSC-CM-based biosensor array with high-throughput and high-consistency beating pattern. Typical withdrawal approved drugs (astemizole, sertindole, cisapride, and droperidol) with hERG inhibition and positive control E-4031 were employed to determine the beating pattern function. From the results, it can be concluded that this iPSC-CM-based biosensor array can specifically differentiate the hERG inhibitors from the non-hERG inhibition compounds through beating pattern function.
