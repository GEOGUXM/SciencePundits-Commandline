One-dimensional PtPd porous nanorods (PtPd PNRs) were successfully synthesized through a bromide-induced galvanic replacement reaction between Pd nanowires and K<inf>2</inf>PtCl<inf>6</inf>. The PtPd PNRs were porous and alloy-structured with Pt/Pd atomic ratio up to 1:1 which were demonstrated by spectroscopic methods. We had also proved that the nanorods could function as peroxidase mimetic for the detection of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, with the detection limit of 8.6nM and the linear range from 20nM to 50mM. The result demonstrated that PtPd PNRs exhibited much higher affinity to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> over other peroxidase mimetics due to synergistically integrating highly catalytic activity of two metals. On the basis of the peroxidase-like activity, the PtPd PNRs were used as a signal transducer to develop a novel and simple colorimetric method for the study of the flux of H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> released from living cell. By using 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine as substrate, the H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> concentration could be distinguished by naked-eye observation without any instrumentation or complicated design. The method developed a new platform for a reliable collection of information on cellular reactive oxygen species release. And the nanomaterial could be used as a power tool for a wide range of potential applications in biotechnology and medicine. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
