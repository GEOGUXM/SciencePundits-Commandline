Succinic acid synthesized from glucose shows potential as a bio-based platform chemical. However, the need for a high glucose concentration, and the accompanying low yields, limit its industrial applications. Despite efficient glucose uptake by the phosphotransferase system (PTS), 1 mol of phosphoenolpyruvate is required for each mole of internalized glucose. Therefore, a PTS-defective Corynebacterium glutamicum mutant was constructed to increase phosphoenolpyruvate availability for succinic acid synthesis, resulting in a lower glucose utilization rate and slower growth. The transcriptional regulator iolR was also deleted to enable the PTS-defective mutant to utilize glucose via iolT-mediated glucose transport. Deletion of iolR and overexpression of iolT1 and ppgk (polyphosphate glucokinase) in the PTS-deficient C. glutamicum strain completely restored glucose utilization, increasing production by 11.6 % and yield by 32.4 % compared with the control. This study revealed for the first time that iolR represses the expression of the two glucokinase genes (glk and ppgk). Â© 2015 Society for Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology
