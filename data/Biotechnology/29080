Wilbrandia ebracteata Cogn is a woody vine popularly known as taiuiá (tayuya), found in the Brasilian flora. Studies have shown that W. ebracteata has analgesic properties and potent anti-inflammatory activity. These properties have been attributed to the presence of cucurbitacins and flavonoids in the plant roots. The aim of this study is to produce an extract from W. ebracteata, standardize it in flavonoids and dihydrocucurbitacins, and perform in vivo assessment of the anti-inflammatory activity. The maximum extraction yields using ethyl acetate solvent was 2.5% (w/w), which was achieved at a plant material-to-solvent ratio of 1:8 (w/v), macerated for 24. h. The extract obtained is a yellow powder containing 8% isovitexin, 1.5% vitexin and 0.3% dihydrocucurbitacin. The topical antiedematogenic activity of the extract was found in acute inflammation models induced by phenol and croton oil. No activity was observed in the chronic inflammation model induced by croton oil. The extract was classified as non-irritating in the test for evaluating primary skin irritation. The results show that the extract of W. ebracteata has the potential for drug development in the treatment of acute inflammatory processes. © 2015.
