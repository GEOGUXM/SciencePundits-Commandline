Patrinia triloba var. takeuchiana is an endangered plant endemic to Japan, and conservation activities on its behalf have begun recently. Fourteen polymorphic microsatellite loci were successfully isolated from P. triloba var. takeuchiana. The range of expected heterozygosity was 0.139–0.666 in the wild population. Four loci showed significant deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Two markers merit caution due to their significant linkage disequilibrium with other markers. The markers described here will be useful for conservation genetics and development of effective conservation programs for P. triloba var. takeuchiana. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
