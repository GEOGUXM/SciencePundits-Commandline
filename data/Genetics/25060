Objective: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are age-associated, life-threatening inflammatory dilations of the abdominal aorta. Human population studies have shown an association between obesity and AAA formation, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this connection remain largely unexplored. Adiponectin is an anti-inflammatory adipokine that is downregulated in obesity. In this study we evaluated the role of adiponectin in a model of AAA using apolipoprotein E/adiponectin double-knockout (Apoe-/- Apn-/-) mice. Approach and results: Angiotensin II (Ang II)-infusion in male Apoe-/- Apn-/- mice led to a higher incidence of AAA and a significant increase of maximal aortic diameter compared with that of Apoe-/- mice (2.12±0.07mm vs. 1.67±0.09mm, respectively at 28 days). Adiponectin deficiency augmented the early infiltration of macrophages and increased the expression of pro-inflammatory factors in the dilated aortic wall. MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation was also augmented in the aorta of Apoe-/- Apn-/- mice compared to Apoe-/- mice. These data suggest that the downregulation of adiponectin could directly contribute to the elevated incidence of AAA observed in obese individuals. Conclusions: Adiponectin attenuates Ang II-induced vascular inflammation and AAA formation in mice. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
