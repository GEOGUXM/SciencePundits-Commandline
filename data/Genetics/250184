Seventeen polymorphic microsatellite markers were isolated and characterized in Arion vulgaris/lusitanicus, which belongs to the worst European slug pests with serious economic and ecological impact. These markers were tested on 23 individuals collected in a population in Switzerland. Numbers of alleles ranged from 2 to 14 per locus, observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.174 to 0.87, and from 0.162 to 0.903, respectively. These loci were also successfully amplified and were polymorphic in the closely related species A. rufus and A. ater. These loci represent the first highly polymorphic nuclear markers described for A. vulgaris and pave the way for population genetics and molecular ecology research of the important Arion pest slugs.
