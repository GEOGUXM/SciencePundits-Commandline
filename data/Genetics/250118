Eighteen microsatellite markers from the humivorous termite Cavitermes tuberosus (Isoptera: Termitidae: Termitinae) were developed using a procedure of microsatellite-enriched libraries pyrosequencing. They were optimized in four multiplex PCR sets, and tested on 38 individuals collected in French Guiana. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 13. The expected and observed heterozygosities varied from 0.279 to 0.867 and from 0.237 to 0.789, respectively. Cross-species amplifications of these loci were performed in eight other neotropical species of Termitidae. These new microsatellite markers will constitute useful tools to study population genetics, reproductive strategies and dispersal patterns of C. tuberosus, which is a common representative of the humivorous guild, fulfilling an essential function in soil nutrient recycling.
