The typical desert-inhabiting shrub Haloxylon ammodendron (C. A. Mey.) Bunge is an important species that is endangered in Northwest China. In this study, variance, correlation and cluster analysis were employed to examine phenotypic variations of H. ammodendron seed traits from 14 populations in China to investigate their relationships with environmental and genetic factors. The average coefficient of variation was higher among regions (26.9%) than within regions (19.8%). Correlation analysis revealed that the diameter/thickness and fruit wing length were significantly correlated with environmental factors. A cluster dendrograms designed based on seed traits was consistent with the finding from environmental and genetic data obtained using Ward's method and the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means. A Mantel test revealed correlation between seed traits and environmental data (. r=0.53, P<0.01) was greater than that between seed traits and genetic data (. r=0.25, P<0.05). Thus, seed traits associated with morphology, mass, and germination varied significantly among the populations, are strongly affected by climatic and geographical factors, and were moderately correlated with genetic diversity. These results provide insights for designing appropriate conservation strategies for H. ammodendron. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
