Next-generation sequencing technologies could potentially be used for the rapid and cost-effective development of a large number of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. On the basis of the transcriptome database of Tegillarca granosa by 454 pyrosequencing, we characterized 90 polymorphic SNP markers in 30 individuals using a high resolution melting diversity assay. The observed heterozygosity varied from 0.000 to 0.9000 and the expected heterozygosity from 0.0333 to 0.8000. The minor allele frequency ranged from 0.0167 to 0.5000 and 37 loci significantly deviated from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P < 0.01). To the best of our knowledge,this is the first report on the research of SNPs in T. granosa. These EST-SNP markers could be used in conservation genetics, as well as providing new insights into the evolutionary relationships of this species. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
