Sixteen nuclear microsatellite markers (SSR) were developed for Viola cheiranthifolia Humb. & Bonpl. (Violaceae), endemic to Tenerife Island (Canary Islands), and tested on the closely related Viola palmensis Web & Berthel., endemic to La Palma Island. All loci showed polymorphism and fifteen of them could be transferred to V. palmensis. They had an average of 5 and 3 alleles per locus in V. cheiranthifolia and V. palmensis, respectively. This set of markers will be useful for studying the population genetics of both species, helping to their conservation and management. Â© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
