Twenty-four new tetranucleotide microsatellite loci, obtained by 454 pyrosequencing, were found in the green abalone Haliotis fulgens. Genetic diversity ranged from 6 to 27 alleles per locus with 0.653–0.912 expected heterozygosity. This provides polymorphic markers for population genetics and parentage analysis focusing on the management and conservation of this species. Cross-amplification in H. corrugata and H. rufescens showed polymorphism in five and four loci, respectively. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
