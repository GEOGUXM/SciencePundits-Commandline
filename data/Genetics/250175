Novel microsatellite markers were developed for the Tasmanian endemic conifer Cheshunt Pine (Diselma archeri), a species vulnerable to increased fire frequency under warming and drying climates. Ten polymorphic microsatellite markers were developed and characterized. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 5 to 14, and average observed heterozygosity was 0.756. No significant departures from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium were detected at all loci. These markers will be useful to investigate population genetics and the importance of clonality for reproduction, for better understandings of the species’ history and ecology. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
