Sixteen novel polymorphic microsatellite loci were developed and characterized for the eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica (Linnaeus 1771) using paired end Illumina shotgun sequencing. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 15 (mean 8). None of the loci tested showed deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium or signs of linkage disequilibruim after Bonferroni correction. These variable loci will be used to assess the population structure of this eastern North American pollinator on multiple scales, to understand how gene flow and population structure are modified over fragmented landscapes, and to observe the potential effects of range shifts due to climate change. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
