Background: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common disorder in man that influences the quality of life of the patient and his partner. Known risk factors for ED comprise diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension but also lifestyle modifications such as smoking, diminished physical activity as well as obesity. In this manuscript the current scientific literature about genetics and erectile dysfunction is reviewed. Materials and methods: A literature search using the databank PubMed covering the topics genetics and erectile dysfunction was performed and relevant papers selected for presentation. Results: Several aspects of genetics and ED are described in the current literature. Association studies of candidate polymorphisms and ED risk in comparison to healthy controls is a major area of research. Another topic is the genome-wide search for candidate polymorphisms with erectile dysfunction. The paper closes with the presentation of the pharmacogenomic analysis of treatment response to phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Discussion: The heterogeneous results of genetic association studies are possibly due to small sample sizes of the study population and/or due to ethnic differences of the analyzed populations. This underlines the need for validation of this data in larger prospective multinational multicenter studies. Â© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
