Background: Manipulation of stand density and choice of genetic material are two key mechanisms through which forest managers can influence tree growth and wood properties. Past silvicultural practices in New Zealand have been characterised by early thinning to relatively wide spacing, while tree improvement programmes have primarily focussed on growth and form. The aim of this study was to quantify the impacts of stand density and past genetic selections on the wood properties of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don). Methods: Stress-wave velocity, wood density, microfibril angle (MFA) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) were measured on trees and wood samples taken from a 15-year-old silvicultural and tree breeds trial located in Canterbury, New Zealand. The focus of this study was comparison of seedlots with genetic ratings of GF6 and GF25. Data from pruned stands with final densities of 100, 200 and 400 stems ha−1 were compared as were data from unpruned stands with stand densities of 200, 400, 600 and 1000 stems ha−1. Results: Stress-wave velocity of trees was affected by final stand density, with the lowest values recorded from trees in the 100 and 200 stems ha−1 treatments. Values for wood MFA and MOE both showed the greatest amount of change when final stand density was less than 400 stems ha−1. Trees from the GF25-rated seedlot had wood density that was approximately 34 kg m−3 lower than trees from the GF6-rated seedlot. Conclusion: Very high stand densities are not required in order to influence wood properties, but early thinning to low stand densities should be avoided. Such results are of practical importance to forestry managers. © 2015, Moore et al.; licensee Springer.
