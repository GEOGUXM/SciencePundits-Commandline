We describe the isolation and characterization of ten polymorphic microsatellite loci for the red-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae) that cross-amplify in the yellow-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus auriceps). The loci were initially tested for 15 individuals/species. The mean expected heterozygosity across all loci was 0.79 (SD ± 0.12) and 0.74 (SD ± 0.13) for red-crowned and yellow-crowned parakeets, respectively. These new microsatellites are useful tools as part of continuing research on the population and conservation genetics of red-crowned parakeets and related species. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
