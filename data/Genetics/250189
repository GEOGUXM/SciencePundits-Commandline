Bletilla striata (Orchidaceae) is an endangered plant species with high ornamental and medicinal value. It is important to acquaint the molecular proofs to protect this endangered species. To evaluate the genetic diversity and population structure of B. striata, 10 polymorphic microsatellites were developed from microsatellite-enriched libraries. Microsatellite loci polymorphism was tested across a total of 31 individuals. The number of alleles per locus both ranged from 4 to 11, with an average of 7.5 per locus. The observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.3077 to 0.6923 and from 0.4908 to 0.8153, respectively. Cross-species amplification of all loci was successful among two congeneric species. The 10 microsatellite loci identified in this study can be utilized as novel markers for further investigation of conservation genetics of B. striata and its congeneric species.
