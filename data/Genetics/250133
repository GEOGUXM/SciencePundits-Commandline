Fifteen polymorphic microsatellite loci were developed and characterized for Rhopilema esculentum using a (GT)<inf>13</inf>-enriched genomic library. The numbers of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 12, and the observed and expected heterozygosities varied from 0.0417 to 0.8750 and from 0.0086 to 0.7055, respectively. These markers will be helpful for QTL mapping, molecular breeding and investigation of population genetic diversity in R. esculentum. Â© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
