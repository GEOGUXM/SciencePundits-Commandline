Recent development in biochemical experiment techniques and bioinformatics has enabled us to create a variety of artificial biocatalysts with protein scaffolds (namely 'artificial enzymes'). The construction methods of these catalysts include genetic mutation, chemical modification using synthetic molecules and/or a combination of these methods. Designed evolution strategy based on the structural information of host proteins has become more and more popular as an effective approach to construct artificial protein-based biocatalysts with desired reactivities. From the viewpoint of application of artificial enzymes for organic synthesis, recently constructed artificial enzymes mediating oxidation, reduction and C-C bond formation/cleavage are introduced in this review article.
