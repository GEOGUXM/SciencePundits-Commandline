Environmental stimuli, including elevated carbon dioxide levels, regulate stomatal development; however, the key mechanisms mediating the perception and relay of the CO<inf>2</inf> signal to the stomatal development machinery remain elusive. To adapt CO<inf>2</inf> intake to water loss, plants regulate the development of stomatal gas exchange pores in the aerial epidermis. A diverse range of plant species show a decrease in stomatal density in response to the continuing rise in atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> (ref. 4). To date, one mutant that exhibits deregulation of this CO<inf>2</inf>-controlled stomatal development response, hic (which is defective in cell-wall wax biosynthesis, ref. 5), has been identified. Here we show that recently isolated Arabidopsis thaliana β-carbonic anhydrase double mutants (ca1 ca4) exhibit an inversion in their response to elevated CO<inf>2</inf>, showing increased stomatal development at elevated CO<inf>2</inf> levels. We characterized the mechanisms mediating this response and identified an extracellular signalling pathway involved in the regulation of CO<inf>2</inf>-controlled stomatal development by carbonic anhydrases. RNA-seq analyses of transcripts show that the extracellular pro-peptide-encoding gene EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR 2 (EPF2), but not EPF1 (ref. 9), is induced in wild-type leaves but not in ca1 ca4 mutant leaves at elevated CO<inf>2</inf> levels. Moreover, EPF2 is essential for CO<inf>2</inf> control of stomatal development. Using cell-wall proteomic analyses and CO<inf>2</inf>-dependent transcriptomic analyses, we identified a novel CO<inf>2</inf>-induced extracellular protease, CRSP (CO<inf>2</inf> RESPONSE SECRETED PROTEASE), as a mediator of CO<inf>2</inf>-controlled stomatal development. Our results identify mechanisms and genes that function in the repression of stomatal development in leaves during atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> elevation, including the carbonic-anhydrase-encoding genes CA1 and CA4 and the secreted protease CRSP, which cleaves the pro-peptide EPF2, in turn repressing stomatal development. Elucidation of these mechanisms advances the understanding of how plants perceive and relay the elevated CO<inf>2</inf> signal and provides a framework to guide future research into how environmental challenges can modulate gas exchange in plants. ©2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
