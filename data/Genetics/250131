Carcasses represent an important source of tissue for many studies, but there are few data regarding which tissues to collect, and how best to treat them. We compared the quantity and quality of DNA from skin and muscle samples from horse carcasses (Equus ferus caballus) in relation to: length of storage at −20 °C, lysis buffer, and carcass decomposition. DNA yields were ~70 % higher from skin than muscle, and DNA in skin was less susceptible to degradation. Freezing tissues at −20 °C did not prevent DNA degradation, and DNA yields decreased ~9 % annually. Yields were similar across lysis buffers, but the forensic lysis buffer was most tractable. Increased carcass decomposition did not significantly impact overall yields of DNA, but did increase the degree of DNA degradation, thus researchers should assess DNA quality (not just quantity) when deciding what samples to use. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
