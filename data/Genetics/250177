We developed 14 microsatellite loci for the solitary parasitoid wasp Hyposoter horticola, an egg-larval endoparasitoid specialist of the Glanville fritillary butterfly Melitaea cinxia, in the Åland islands, Finland. The microsatellites were developed from a 454 sequencing enriched library. The characteristics of the primer sets and polymerase chain reactions for these microsatellite markers are presented. Thirteen of the 14 loci tested were polymorphic with on average 3.6 alleles per locus (range 3–6). The expected (H<inf>E</inf>) and observed (H<inf>O</inf>) heterozygosities ranged from 0.19 to 0.76 and 0.20 to 0.62 respectively. These markers can be used to study population genetics and genetic relatedness in H. horticola or related taxa, and to assess the presence of the parasitoid in hosts. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
