The outbreak of white-nose syndrome in North American bats has resulted in massive data collection efforts to characterize the fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans. Wing biopsies routinely are collected from live bats, placed in agar media to culture the fungus, and ultimately discarded. We tested whether these discarded tissues represent a viable source of host bat DNA. We found no difference in DNA concentration and no reduction of DNA quality between samples that were extracted immediately compared to samples placed in agar for fungal culture. Although recovered quantities were low, concentrations increased using a cleanup kit. Our study suggests samples collected from live bats can be leveraged across disciplines to further our understanding of bat genetics and the impact of white-nose syndrome. Â© 2015, The Author(s).
