Arginine kinase (AK) is a panallergen present in crustaceans, which can induce an immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated immune response in humans. The aim of this work was to map and characterize the antigenic epitopes of Scylla paramamosain AK. Specific-protein-A-enriched IgG raised in rabbits against purified S. paramamosain AK was used to screen a phage display random peptide library. Five AK mimotope clones were identified among 20 random clones after biopanning. Four conformational epitopes D<inf>3</inf>A<inf>4</inf>K<inf>43</inf>M<inf>1</inf>A<inf>5</inf>T<inf>49</inf>T<inf>44</inf>I<inf>7</inf>, L<inf>31</inf>K<inf>33</inf>V<inf>35</inf>T<inf>32</inf>E<inf>11</inf>E<inf>18</inf>F<inf>14</inf>S<inf>34</inf>D<inf>37</inf>, V<inf>177</inf>G<inf>172</inf>M<inf>173</inf>D<inf>176</inf>Q<inf>178</inf>T<inf>174</inf>L<inf>181</inf>K<inf>175</inf>L<inf>187</inf>, and R<inf>202</inf>L<inf>170</inf>Y<inf>203</inf>E<inf>190</inf>P<inf>205</inf>W<inf>204</inf>L<inf>187</inf>T<inf>206</inf>Y<inf>145</inf> were identified with the program LocaPep, and mapped to S. paramamosain AK. The key amino acids of these conformational epitopes were D<inf>3</inf>, K<inf>33</inf>, T<inf>174</inf>, and W<inf>204</inf>, respectively. On the basis of biopanning, six IgE-specific peptides were mapped with synthetic overlapping peptides using the sera from crab-allergic patients, and four seropositive peptides (amino acids 113-127, 127-141, 141-155, and 204-218) were confirmed as linear epitopes in a degranulation assay in RBL-2H3 cells. Stability experiments showed that the structural integrity of AK is essential for its allergenicity, and the intramolecular disulfide bond at Cys<inf>201</inf>-Cys<inf>271</inf> is essential for its structural stability.
