Decabrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE-209) is a persistent organic pollutant. Gestational exposure to PBDE-209 can accumulate in pregnant women and fetuses via the placenta and umbilical cord, affecting perinatal outcome. In this study, pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into five groups and intragastrically administered peanut oil (vehicle) 1, 5 and 10. mg/kg by body weight (b.w.) of PBDE-209, or nothing (control) from day 0 (G0) to day 21 (G21) gestation, respectively. Placental samples were collected on G21 by cesarean section. The mRNA and protein expressions of ET-1, eNOS and iNOS in the placenta were examined using qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Total nitric oxide (NO) in the placenta was measured using a specific ELISA kit. Compared with the control and vehicle groups, the mRNA expression of ET-1 and iNOS in the placenta was gradually and significantly increased after exposure to increasing concentrations of PBDE-209 (P<. 0.05), while the mRNA level of eNOS in the placenta was gradually and significantly reduced after exposure to increasing concentrations of PBDE-209 (P<. 0.05). The expression trends of ET-1, eNOS and iNOS proteins were consistent with those of mRNA expression. Interestingly, the production of total NO was significantly increased after exposure to 5 and 10. mg/kg b.w. PBDE-209 (P<. 0.05). Finally, the birth weight of the offspring rats was significantly reduced after maternal exposure to 5 and 10. mg/kg b.w. PBDE-209 compared with the control and vehicle groups (P<. 0.05). These results suggest that PBDE-209 exposure during pregnancy upregulates ET-1 and iNOS expression, but decreases eNOS expression in the placenta, as well as reduces the birth weight of offspring.
