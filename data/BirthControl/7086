The manifestation of anxiety during pregnancy can be caused by multiple factors and may have emotional and physical consequences for both the mother and the fetus. The prevalence of gestational anxiety has grown in recent years, making the development of studies for its comprehension essential. Thus, the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of predictable and unpredictable chronic stressors on the anxiety profile of rats in three distinct stages of pregnancy (1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks). Wistar dams were divided into three groups: control, social separation and unpredictable chronic stress. Behavioral assessments were conducted in the Elevated Plus-Maze at the end of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks of gestation. The results showed that there was increased anxiety in the proximity of parturition in control dams. Chronic stressors differentially affected the behavior of pregnant rats according to the gestational period where they were applied: social separation decreased anxiety at the end of the 3rd week, while unpredictable chronic stress caused increased anxiety, especially at the end of the 2nd gestational week. These results show that there is a critical time during pregnancy for the onset of anxiety in control rats, depending on the gestational stage. The exposure to different types of chronic stressors may result in distinct behaviors related to this disorder. Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.
