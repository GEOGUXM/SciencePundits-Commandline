We studied effect of immobilization stress of mothers during third week of pregnancy on blood glucose levels and body weight in adult male rats. Male rats of each group were weighted on the 60th day of their birth and blood glucose was measured. Birth weight showed a significant decrease in experimental groups (birth weights in control group, experimental group1, 2, 3 were 171.54, 157.01, 132.42, 126.28 g) and serum glucose level showed a significant elevation in experimental groups compared with control group (serum glucose levels in control group, experimental group1,2,3 were 99.29, 113.99, 115.05, 120.79 mg/dL). © 2014, Research Society for Study of Diabetes in India.
