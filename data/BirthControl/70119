Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether midtrimester isolated short femur length is associated with pregnancy complications. Study Design: Retrospective analysis of pregnancies with a midtrimester femur length <5th percentile for gestational age compared to controls with a femur length ≥5th percentile. Outcome measures included hypertensive disorders, being small for gestational age, oligohydramnios and preterm delivery. Results: 2,105 women were eligible for this study, 85 (3.45%) of whom were in the study group and 2,020 were controls. Birth weight <10th percentile for gestational age (OR 4.4, 95% CI 2.5-7.8), birth weight <3rd percentile for gestational age (OR 31.0, 95% CI 13.3-72.3) and severe preeclampsia (OR 6.3, 95% CI 1.4-28.6) were significantly associated with midtrimester isolated short femur length. Conclusions: Midtrimester isolated short femur length is associated with higher rates of being small for gestational age and preeclampsia. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel Copyright © 2015, S. Karger AG.
