Purpose: To investigate the perinatal outcomes of patients with clinical pregnancies from ICSI treatments who had previously undergone hysteroscopic surgery to correct partial intrauterine septa and compare them to outcomes of patients with no intrauterine anomalies.Method: A retrospective observational analysis of 2024 ultrasound confirmed pregnancies from ICSI treatments performed between January 2005 and June 2012. The patients were grouped according to their intrauterine status, and sub-grouped according to the number of fetal hearts observed; singleton control (n = 1128), twin control (n = 566), singleton septum (n = 217) and twin septum (n = 113). The primary outcomes analyzed were miscarriage, preterm, very preterm, stillbirth, vanishing twin and live delivery rates, as well as low birth weight and very low birth weight rates.Result(s): The live birth rate (89,9 %) in the singleton control subgroup was non-significantly higher than the live birth rate (85,3 %) in the septum subgroup, with a RR of 1,05 (p = 0,0583, 95 % CI 0,9943–1,1182) for live birth. In contrast the live birth rate (91,3 %) in twin control subgroup was significantly higher than the live birth rate (84,1 %) in the septum subgroup, with a RR 1,09 (p = 0,0282, 95 % CI 0,9988–1,1819). Non-significantly, higher miscarriage and stillbirth rates were the main contributors to the reduced live birth rates. The singleton and twin septum subgroups also had higher rates of premature and very premature delivery and LBWs and vLBW, especially in the singleton septum subgroup.Conclusion(s): The hysteroscopic correction of intrauterine septa may not eliminate all risks for premature delivery. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
