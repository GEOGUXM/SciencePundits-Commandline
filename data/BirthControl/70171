Objective: Despite high prevalence of otitis media in Aboriginal children, the acoustic-mechanical properties of their outer and middle ear during the neonatal period remain obscured. The objective of this study was to compare the acoustic-mechanical properties of outer and middle ear using Sweep Frequency Impedance (SFI) measures between Australian Aboriginal and Caucasian neonates. Methods: SFI data from 40 ears of 24 Aboriginal neonates (16 males, 8 females) with mean gestational age of 39.57 weeks (SD = 1.25) and 160 ears of 119 Caucasian neonates (57 males, 62 females) with mean gestational age of 39.28 weeks (SD = 1.25) serving as controls were analysed. SFI data in terms of resonance frequency (RF) and mobility of the outer and middle ear (δSPL) were collected from neonates who passed a test battery that included automated auditory brainstem response, distortion product otoacoustic emissions test and 1000-Hz tympanometry. SFI data were analysed using descriptive statistics and analysis of variance. Results: There was no significant difference in mean gestational age, age of testing and birth weight between the Aboriginal and Caucasian neonates. The mean resonance frequencies for the outer ear (mean RF1 = 264.9. Hz, SD = 58.6. Hz) and middle ear (mean RF2 = 1144. Hz, SD = 228.8. Hz) for Aboriginal neonates were significantly lower than that of Caucasian neonates (mean RF1 = 295.3. Hz, SD = 78.4. Hz and mean RF2 = 1241.8. Hz, SD = 216.6. Hz). However, no significant difference in the mobility of outer ear (δSPL1) and middle ear (δSPL2) between the two groups was found. Middle ear resonance was absent in 22.5% (9 ears) of Aboriginal ears but present in all Caucasian ears. Conclusions: This study provided evidence that despite passing the test battery, Aboriginal neonates had significantly lower resonance frequencies of the outer and middle ear than Caucasian neonates. Furthermore, 22.5% of Aboriginal neonates showed no middle ear resonance, indicating the possibility of subtle middle ear issues not detected by the test battery. Reasons for the different acoustic-mechanical properties between the two ethnic groups remain unclear and require further investigation. © 2015.
