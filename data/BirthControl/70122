With infertility populations rapidly aging, treatments improving pregnancy chances assume increasing clinical importance. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been reported to improve pregnancy rates and lower miscarriage rates in women with diminished ovarian function. This study was planned to evaluate whether pretreatment with DHEA may improve in vitro fertilization (IVF) parameters and pregnancy outcomes in infertile women with advanced reproductive age and normal ovarian reserve. Methods: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 109 infertile patients aging 36-40 years old were selected to undergo the long protocol IVF. Eight weeks before starting the IVF cycle and during treatment, patients in Group 1 received 75 mg of DHEA once a day; patients in control group (Group 2) received placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was number of clinical pregnancy, live birth and miscarriage rates; secondary endpoint was modification of standard IVF parameters, including stimulation duration (days of rhFSH administration), E2 on HCG-day, endometrial thickness, number of retrieved oocytes, metaphase II oocytes, number of transferred embryos and score of leading embryos transferred. Results: Patients in the DHEA group had a significantly higher live birth rate compared with controls (P < 0.05). Conversely, miscarriage rate was higher for patients in the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: DHEA supplementation may significantly improve IVF outcomes in infertile women with advanced reproductive age and normal ovarian reserve. Â© Tartagni et al.; licensee BioMed Central.
