The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of yogurt with different pH values as partial milk replacer on performance, health and blood parameters of Holstein calves. A total of 35 Holstein calves (two males and five females per each treatment) from the fourth day of birth until two weeks after weaning were randomly assigned to the five experimental dietary treatments. Experimental groups consisted of control (milk without yogurt) and groups fed milk containing 15% and 30% probiotic yogurt with pH values of either 3.8 or 4.5. Results showed that starter intake (SI) and dry matter intake (DMI) were not affected by dietary treatments throughout (except 4–7 d) the trial period. Partial substitution of probiotic yogurt resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) increase in SI compared with control calves at seventh and eighth weeks of trial. Also, using probiotic yogurt with pH of 4.5 increased (P < 0.05) SI when compared with pH value of 3.8 at the second trial week. On the other hand, DMI was significantly (P < 0.01) lower in yogurt-fed calves than milk group at seventh week of experiment. Compared to control, inclusion of probiotic yogurt increased (P < 0.001) daily and total weight gain. Feed conversion ratio was lower (P < 0.01) in yogurt-fed groups compared with control calves. Partial substitution of probiotic yogurt for milk increased body length, wither height and hip depth. In addition, inclusion of probiotic yogurt to partially replace milk resulted in increased (P < 0.01) lymphocyte proportion and decreased (P < 0.05) neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio. Although experimental treatments affected serum concentrations of triglyceride (P < 0.01) and cholesterol (P < 0.05), however, had no effect on serum glucose and total protein levels. Results indicate that partial substitution of probiotic yogurt for milk could improve growth performance and modulate immune status of calves as measured by leukocytes alterations. © 2015 Taylor & Francis
