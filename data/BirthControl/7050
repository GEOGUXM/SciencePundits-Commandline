The myogenic regulatory factor (MRF) family includes Myf5, MyoD1, Myf4, and Mfy6 genes. This experiment assessed the variation of Myf5 and MyoD1 genes from birth to maturity (30, 210, and 360 days) in the back muscle tissue of Wuzhishan pigs (WZSP), and the expression of Myf5 and MyoD1 mRNA in the heart, liver, lung, spleen, kidney, muscle, stomach, and intestine tissues were also examined. The results indicate that the expression level of mRNA for Myf5 and MyoD1 genes in the back muscle tissue is directly proportional to age (P < 0.05). Furthermore, of the eight adult pig tissue types that were tested, the expression of Myf5 and MyoD1 was highest in the muscle tissue. Â© FUNPEC-RP.
