The Anglo-Jewish leadership, and particularly the Board of Deputies of British Jews, has suffered periodic crises of authority due to its preference for a quietist political style that emphasizes diplomacy and communal image over public campaigning. The birth of the Soviet Jewry movement in the mid-1960s and its growth in the early 1970s prompted one such crisis, as Jewish students and women began to adopt the campaigning methods of contemporaneous New Left political activism to press the case for Soviet Jews. The response of the Board of Deputies to this challenge revealed a flexible and adaptive attitude toward political activism, and even a growing appetite for public campaigning, that belies some of the harsher criticism directed at the board by some historians of Anglo-Jewry. Tensions between the Anglo-Jewish establishment and grassroots activists were mirrored in the United States, indicating that concern about image and control was not a specifically British condition. Meanwhile, the desire of grassroots activists to gain political access to Westminster suggests that the dichotomy of quiet diplomacy versus public activism is too simplistic; rather, the two approaches complemented each other in efforts to generate public and political support for Soviet Jews.
