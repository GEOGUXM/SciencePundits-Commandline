Purpose: To evaluate the two-year follow-up of patients with type 1 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) who received intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) as adjunctive treatment. Materials and methods: We conducted a longitudinal follow-up study of premature infants who received 0.625mg IVB therapy in addition to standard laser photocoagulation therapy. For comparison of the ophthalmological and neurological assessment outcomes of these infants, a control group was formed with 13 birth weight- and gestational age-matched infants who were treated with laser therapy alone for type 1 ROP. The neurological status of the study group and the control group was examined systematically, and neurodevelopmental evaluation was assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III). Results: A total of 18 eyes of 13 infants were included in the study. Anatomical success was obtained in 14 eyes (78%) and retinal detachment was observed in 4 eyes (22%). At two years of age, no significant difference was found in terms of spherical or cylindrical refractive errors compared to the control group. In control group, 2/13 patients' and in study group, 3/13 patients' neurological examinations were abnormal. No significant difference was found in the mean cognitive, language or motor BSID-III test scores of the groups. Conclusions: IVB appears to be useful for advanced ROP when laser treatment is precluded or not sufficient for preventing the progression of ROP. This pilot study indicates that IVB seems to contribute no further complications to the complications already present due to prematurity. Â© 2015 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.
