Neural tube defect (NTD) is a severe congenital birth abnormalities involving incomplete neural tube closure. 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene plays key role in folate cycle and methylation cycle, which could affect the DNA synthesis, repair and methylation. In this study, we aim to investigate the correlation between MTHFR polymorphisms and NTD-affected pregnancy. There were 444 participants involved in our study. Tag-SNPs were identified in HapMap Databases. Blood samples were collected from all subjects to further extract the genomic DNAs by TaqMan Blood DNA kits. We also carried out a meta-analysis based on previous published studies to further examine the association between MTHFR polymorphisms and NTD. In case–control study analysis, two SNPs were identified to be associated with NTD risk. The 677 C > T genetic variant was correlated with increased risk of NTD-affected pregnancy. However, the 1298 A > C polymorphism was shown to lower the risk of NTD-affected pregnancy. The protective role of 1298 A > C polymorphisms was further supported by the result of meta-analysis. Our study revealed that the SNPs of 677C > T and 1298A > C in MTHFR were associated with NTD-affected pregnancy, in which 677C > T was a risk factor and in contrast 1298A > C was protective factor against NTD. Our results of meta-analysis also revealed the 1298A > C MTHFR polymorphism play protective role in NTD. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
