The current distribution and recent population trends of the Great Bustard (Otis tarda) in Iran were investigated based on a literature review and unpublished data (1995–2008) followed by three years of census (2009–2011) in areas where the species is still breeding. Results suggest that Great Bustards have disappeared from a large part of their former distribution in the country, including East Azarbayjan, Hamedan and Kurdistan provinces. The surviving groups are concentrated in West Azarbayjan where numbers are rapidly declining. The present population is estimated at about 43–48 birds in 2011, confirming a marked decline compared to the 200–300 birds estimated in the early 1990s. About 80–90% of the extant birds are concentrated in the plains of Boukan. Strict conservation measures are urgently needed to prevent the extinction of this species in Iran.
