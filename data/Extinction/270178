The use and trade of animals in traditional medicine involves many different species, some of which are threatened with extinction. Thus, evaluating biological and cultural aspects associated with this business is essential for the conservation of these species. The aim of this study was to analyze the viability of replacing wild animal with plant or domestic animals for use in medicines. To conduct this analysis, we used current literature from five Brazilian cities that have data available for the trade in animals and plants for medicinal purposes (Recife, Caruaru, Campina Grande, Belém, and Boa Vista). We compiled data on the diversity of animals and plants traded in these locations as well as their respective therapeutic applications. The potential replacement of products derived of wild animals was evaluated by the analysis of overlapping use (of plants and animals and of wild and domestic animals) as well as by the analysis of the relationship between zootherapeutic products and their target diseases. The data showed little overlap between the use of medicinal plant and animals as well as between the use of wild and domestic animals. However, the analysis of the relationship between zootherapeutic products and their target diseases provides evidence of possible replacements of wild animals by domestic animals. Although there is an urgent need for new research on the cultural and biological contexts associated with the use of wild animals for medicinal purposes, projects that aim to mitigate the impacts caused by this trade must consider the use of alternative methods. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg
