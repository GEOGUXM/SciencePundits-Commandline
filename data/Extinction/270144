Shiffman et al. assert that International Game Fish Association (IGFA) records are threatening imperiled fish populations. Here I report that 88% of the species identified by the authors were first listed as threatened within the last 20 years and, during this time, IGFA received a total of 15 All-Tackle record applications for these species. The low number of records placed within the appropriate context of total global landings for these species does not support the hypothesis that IGFA All-Tackle records have a disproportionately negative impact on imperiled species as the authors suggest, but rather a disproportionately low impact.
