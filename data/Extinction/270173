Parameters in ecological models are often known to be imprecise. In this paper, we consider a two-species competition fishery model with interval-valued species specific growth rates and interspecies competition parameters. Conditions involving the lower and upper bounds of the model imprecise parameters are derived for extinction and coexistence of two competing species. Existence of bionomic equilibria and optimal harvesting policies are also discussed. Numerical simulations based on Monte Carlo method are performed to address biological implications of our findings. Â© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht
