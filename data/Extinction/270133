Mate-finding difficulties in small populations are often postulated to create strong demographic Allee effects that increase the probability of extinction of native species or, similarly, decrease the probability that non-native species will successfully invade. Many species make use of a restricted number of mating locations, detectable from long-distance, that are not selected for habitat reasons (e.g., hilltopping in butterflies). This ‘landmarking’ strategy may specifically address the problem of overcoming mate-finding difficulties. Using a variant of the birthday problem, we demonstrate that populations which locate a restricted number of mate-finding sites using landmark features may have high probability of successful mating even at very low population densities. Therefore, a strong Allee threshold, if it exists, may be very small, and non-native species that make use of this strategy may have a very good chance of population establishment at low density. © 2015 The Author(s)
