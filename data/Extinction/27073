Malladas de El Saler is a mosaic of dune slacks scattered along a coastal sand bar in the Mediterranean region. Active populations of the fairy shrimp T. stagnalis are exclusively present in one of these ponds. We combined field observations and laboratory experiments to find the ecological requirements of T. stagnalis that determine this habitat exclusiveness and the possibility of future establishment in nearby ponds. Conductivity revealed as a determinant ecological constraint. In the field, the species was restricted to conductivity levels below 1.28 mS cm−1 and in experimental microcosms, hatchability, survival and reproductive potential were detrimental from 2.9 mS cm−1. The observation of life history characteristics from the experimental individuals confirmed the importance of the unpredictable character of Mediterranean temporary ponds in shaping life history strategies, as they hatched early, matured rapidly and produced a high number of cysts. We discuss the essential steps during colonization that may explain the presence or absence in our ponds, and revealed a harsh future for the species if the current conditions of habitat deterioration persist. We suggest several conservation measures, including a cyst bank storage or/and adult translocations to nearby suitable ponds. These measures will ensure (1) the preservation of genetic diversity and (2) healthy metapopulation dynamics with recolonization rates compensating for local extinctions. © 2015 The Ecological Society of Japan
