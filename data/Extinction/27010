The paper characterizes some qualitative dynamic properties of a stochastic non-autonomous multi-species mutualism model, with continuous periodic parameters. Using Khasminskii theory of stability with suitable Lyapunov functions, and M-Matrices, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee existence of positive periodic solutions to the system. We also provide conditions for the global attractiveness of the latter, or extinction of all species for sufficiently high volatility levels. Results are finally supported by numerical computations.
