Functional diversity indices typically focus on a small number of recognised important traits. The phylogenetic diversity measure (PD) has provided one way to make inferences about a broader array of traits. However, PD’s assumption that shared ancestry explains shared features cannot account for all shared traits. An alternative functional diversity index, EDf, shifts the focus from shared ancestry to shared habitat as the explanation of shared traits among species. EDf calculations use a functional trait space with dimensions reflecting environmental or habitat gradients, contrasting with conventional traits spaces in which dimensions are defined by nominated traits. The EDf method assumes a unimodal relationship between traits and habitat gradients, reflecting its assumption that shared habitat explains shared traits among species. This model allows inference of the relative trait diversity of different subsets of species. EDf adapts the environmental diversity (ED) method, which was designed to evaluate the diversity of subsets of sites under a model of unimodal response of species to gradients. The re-casting of the model as unimodal response of traits to gradients means that EDf makes inferences about the relative number of traits represented by different subsets of species. This “counting-up” of traits means that EDf not only can evaluate the functional trait diversity of subsets of species but also provide other calculations supporting biodiversity conservation planning. For priority setting among species, weighted EDf distinctiveness indicates the extent to which a species has traits shared by few others. Probabilistic EDf integrates estimated species’ extinction probabilities. EDf can support conservation planning for functional diversity that effectively balances conservation of traits of known importance with conservation of more general functional trait diversity. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht
