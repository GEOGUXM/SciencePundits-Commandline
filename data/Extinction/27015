The angular profiles of canopy gap fraction curves are influenced by canopy structure, and are commonly expected to vary with stand- and crown-level variables such as tree pattern, crown shape and leaf orientation. In this study, measurements of canopy structure, gap fractions and effective LAI in 986 plots of Scots pine, Norway spruce and Silver birch stands in Finland were used to assess how similar the angular canopy gap fraction profiles are for common boreal tree species. The profiles were characterized with help of the shape function ψ(. θ), defined as the normalized value of the canopy light extinction coefficient at zenith angle (. θ). Variation in ψ(. θ) would be induced not only by a non-spherical leaf orientation, but also by differences in the directional clumping indices, such as could result from species-specific differences in crown shape. Our results showed that there is wide variation in the shape of ψ in the individual plots of the three different species. The species-specific mean curves ψ(. θ), however, showed relatively small variation with θ, except for a sudden drop at large zenith angles, and the shape of the curves was similar for the different tree species. Results indicate that differences in crown shape of the study species do not significantly affect the angular profiles of canopy gap fraction. © 2015 Z.
