In this paper, two-species stochastic Lotka-Volterra competition system is proposed and discussed. Some sufficient conditions on the boundedness, extinction, non-persistence in the mean, and weak persistence of solutions are established. The critical value between weak persistence and extinction is obtained. Â© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
