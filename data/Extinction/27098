The current distribution of Cajanus lineatus in the forest area of the Western Ghats including Kumbharli Ghat, Mahabaleshwar, Lonavala, Khandala and Sinhgarh, from where the species was reported earlier, was estimated. The extensive exploration of these areas revealed that Cajanus lineatus is facing severe threat of habitat loss/fragmentation due to anthropogenic activities. Very few fragmented populations with a small number of plants such as one or two individuals were found and most of them had vanished when visited subsequently. The species almost disappeared from most of the native places as urbanization and road constructions have increased importantly. Cajanus lineatus prefers open places, mainly targeted by these activities. Hence, the present situation of the habitat-specific C. lineatus in these areas is alarming and very soon the species will be at the verge of extinction.
