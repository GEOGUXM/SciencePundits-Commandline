In this paper, a new stochastic two-species predator–prey model which is ratio-dependent and a specific functional response is considered in, is proposed. The existence of a global positive solution to the model for any positive initial value is shown. Stochastically ultimate boundedness and uniform continuity are derived. Moreover, under some sufficient conditions, the stochastic permanence and extinction are established for the model. At last, numerical simulations are carried out to support our results. © 2014, Korean Society for Computational and Applied Mathematics.
