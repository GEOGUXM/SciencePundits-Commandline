Recent rapid developments in biotechnology and genomics mean that ‘de-extinction’ – the resurrection of extinct species – is now a real possibility. The opportunity to see living examples of long-dead creatures has important implications (benefits and risks) for nature-based tourism. This paper introduces the topic of de-extinction, briefly discusses how it relates to tourism and indicates areas for further research. © 2015 Taylor & Francis
