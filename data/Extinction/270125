A quantitative study of calcareous nannofossils, planktonic, and benthic foraminiferal assemblages have been performed on fifty six samples collected from ~40 m interval across the Paleocene/Eocene transition at Nag El-Quda section in Upper Nile Valley, Egypt. I study this interval to evaluate the faunal and floral changes across the P/E transition. Four biozones of calcareous nannofossils and seven planktonic biozones have been recorded. The benthic foraminifera extinction event (BFEE) and the characteristic datum of both calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifera, have been recognized. The absence of deep-sea benthic foraminifera (Stensioeina beccariiformis), the low abundance of (Angulogavelinella avnimelechi and Gavelinella rubiginosus) and increasing dominance of shallow-marine taxa (buliminids, Loxostomoides applinae) indicate deposition of the interval in shallow water environments (100–150 m depth). The benthic foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by Loxostomoides applinae, buliminids, and Lenticulina spp and indicate dysoxic conditions. Quantitative analyses have revealed a change in the species richness and fluctuations in abundance of foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils. © 2015 The Association of Korean Geoscience Societies and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg
