In this work, we consider a Lotka–Volterra competition system with impulsive linear invasion between two patches. We prove all solutions of the investigated system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Some conditions are obtained to guarantee the population x(t)-extinction periodic solution is linearly stable, this indicates that the alien species invade successfully, and exclude the native species to extinct. The permanent conditions of the investigated system is also obtained, this indicates that the alien species invade successfully, and the alien species coexist with the native species. Numerical analysis are inserted to illustrate our results. By the numerical analysis, we find that there exists a threshold of invading unsuccessfully, which indicates that the alien species invade unsuccessfully, and the native species excludes the alien species to extinct. These results indicate that impulsive linear invasion plays an important role in dynamics of ecosystem. Our results provide reliable tactic basis for the biological resources management. © 2014, Korean Society for Computational and Applied Mathematics.
