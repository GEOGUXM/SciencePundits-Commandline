Parasites are considered as an important factor in regulating their host populations through trait-mediated effects. On the other hand, predation becomes particularly interesting in host-parasite systems because predation can significantly alter the abundance of parasites and their host population. The combined effects of parasites and predator on host population and community structure therefore may have larger effect. Different field experiments confirm that predators consume disproportionately large number of infected prey in comparison to their susceptible counterpart. There are also substantial evidences that predator has the ability to distinguish prey that have been infected by a parasite and avoid such prey to reduce fitness cost. In this paper we study the predator-prey dynamics, where the prey species is infected by some parasites and predators consume both the susceptible and infected prey with some preference. We demonstrate that complexity in such systems largely depends on the predator's selectivity, force of infection and predator's reproductive gain. If the force of infection and predator's reproductive gain are low, parasites and predators both go to extinction whatever be the predator's preference. The story may be totally different in the opposite case. Survival of species in stable, oscillatory or chaotic states, and their extinction largely depend on the predator's preference. The system may also show two coexistence equilibrium points for some parameter values. The equilibrium with lower susceptible prey density is always stable and the equilibrium with higher susceptible prey density is always unstable. These results suggest that understanding the consequences of predator's selectivity or preference may be crucial for community structure involving parasites. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
