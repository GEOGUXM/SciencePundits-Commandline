This paper presents a nonautonomous impulsive stochastic differential model of competition between species which contains the classic two-species competitive Lotka-Volterra model as a special case. With the theory of impulsive stochastic differential equations, a good understanding of stochastic permanence and extinction of system is obtained. Two specific numerical examples are presented to support the analytical results. Conclusions are also given. Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
