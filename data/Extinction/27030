In this paper, we proposed and investigated a model on the process of periodic harvesting and diffusion at different fixed moments using an impulsive differential equation with distributed delay and additive Allee effect. In this model, prey species was restricted to a single patch, and predator species will diffuse between two patches. By using the theories of impulsive equations, small amplitude perturbation skills and comparison techniques, we obtained the sufficient conditions ensuring the global asymptotical stability of the prey-eradication periodic solution and permanence of the system. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried out to consolidate the analytical findings. Â© 2014, Korean Society for Computational and Applied Mathematics.
