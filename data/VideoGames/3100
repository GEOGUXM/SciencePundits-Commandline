Abstract As exer-game technology is increasingly integrated into workout and rehabilitation programs, it is important to understand how physical exertion, hedonics, and game usability experiences affect the knowledgeable player. In a repeated measures experiment, seven experienced players played five popular dance exer-games on separate days. Exertion was measured using indirect calorimetry. Hedonic experience was measured using questions about engagement and game-flow. Platform and software usability was determined by questionnaire and percent time spent in non-play activities (menu interfaces, software loading). Mean MET levels ranged from 4.26 to 9.18 during gameplay, depending on the game. Player engagement and game-flow were closely related to MET activity. Usability scores were closely related to time spent in non-play activities. Games with increased MET levels and higher usability scores were reflected in higher engagement and game-flow scores. Degree of interface embodiment did not affect these outcomes. Based on these results, problems in usability are barriers to engagement. Designing games that provide a balance of challenge, immersion, and engagement is a difficult task. These results demonstrate the importance of examining players of varying skill levels in order to fully understand the interaction of physical exertion, platform usability and player engagement.
