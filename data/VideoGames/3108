Spatio-temporal querying and retrieval is a challenging task due to the lack of simple user interfaces for building queries despite the availability of powerful indexing structures and querying languages. In this paper, we propose Query-by-Gaming scheme for spatio-temporal querying that can benefit from gaming controller for building queries. By using Query-by-Gaming, we introduce our spatio-temporal querying and retrieval system named as GStar to interactively build subsequent spatio-temporal queries to determine if a state is directly reachable from current state and eventual spatio-temporal queries to know whether a spatial state is reachable from a current state. Queries are built using features of gaming controller by displaying the original video frames rather than on a graphical interface using a mouse or a keyboard. GStar has three main components: building the query, searching and retrieval of clips, and displaying query results. The queries are applied to an indexing structure called semantic sequence state graph (S3G) and results of the query are displayed dynamically to provide timely feedback to the user. Experimental results and user interface are provided for a tennis video database. Users define desired game state (player and ball position) using an interactive interface at multiple points in time and GStar automatically retrieves all rallies that contain both states. Finally, the user interface evaluation comparing gamepad-based interface and mouse interface for spatio-temporal querying has been studied. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
