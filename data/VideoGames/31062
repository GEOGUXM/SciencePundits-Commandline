A growing body of literature has emerged that focuses upon cognitive assessment of video game player experience. Given the growing popularity of video gaming and the increasing literature on cognitive aspects of video gamers, there is a growing need for novel approaches to assessment of the cognitive processes that occur while persons are immersed in video games. In this study, we assessed various stimulus modalities and gaming events using an off-the-shelf EEG devise. A significant difference was found among different stimulus modalities with increasingly difficult cognitive demands. Specifically, beta and gamma power were significantly increased during high intensity events when compared to low intensity gaming events. Our findings suggest that the Emotiv EEG can be used to differentiate between varying stimulus modalities and accompanying cognitive processes. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
