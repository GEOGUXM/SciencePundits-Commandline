This dataset includes a series of 30 education-related majors' performance measures before and after they completed a 10-hour video game practice in a computer lab. The goal of the experimental study was to examine the effects of action video gaming on students' mathematics performance and mathematics anxiety as mediated by the effect of attention on working memory. The dataset includes students' pre- and posttest performance measures for geometry, word and non-word mathematics problems, perceived cognitive load associated with mathematics assessment, mental rotation test, working memory assessment, mathematics anxiety and confidence in learning mathematics.
