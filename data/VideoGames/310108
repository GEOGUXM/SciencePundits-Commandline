The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of singing video games on the pitch-matching skills of undergraduate students. Popular games like Rock Band and Karaoke Revolutions rate players' singing based on the correctness of the frequency of their sung response. Players are motivated to improve their scores each time they play. In this experiment, I tested undergraduate non-musicians' (N = 33) pitch-matching ability before and after playing one of these games for 10 minutes. Acoustical analysis revealed a significant difference between pre-and post-test scores. These data suggest that playing the video game for 10 minutes may have produced an immediate, observable change in pitch-matching scores. Music teachers regularly teach students how to develop pitch-matching skills. Games like the one used in this study may add to the tools used in that process. Â© 2014 Taylor and Francis.
