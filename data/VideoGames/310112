The aim of the study reported here was to investigate people's ability to learn a new auditory environment. A specific coding was developed in order to design an auditory version of a vision-based simple video game involving moving objects. We investigated the learning process of participants in this purely auditory game and the influence of the following factors on performance: gender, level of practice in video games and three cognitive abilities, namely, mental rotation, visual attention and spatial perception. The results revealed that occasional and regular players' level of performance significantly improved with practice, whereas those of nonplayers did not. They also revealed a significant influence of gender. Scores in the mental rotation test was found to be correlated only with the final level of performance. This study provides insights into people's ability to learn new ways to perceive and interact with auditory objects in motion and highlights the cognitive abilities that influence this learning.
