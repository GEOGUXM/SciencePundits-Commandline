Introduction: Like any other audiovisual products, video games are tools that enable the transmission of contents. However, while the educational utilities of this medium of communication have been researched in several occasions, its transmission of values has not been analysed in depth. Method: A correlational approach based on a survey questionnaire has been used in order to examine video game consumption habits among adolescents (N=110). In addition, the content of the video games used the most by research participants was subjected to analysis. Results and conclusions: The study has shown that there are significant differences in video game usage among male and female adolescents, and that there are no significant differences according to age groups. The study also confirmed that video games are, indeed, transmitters of certain values. © 2015, Revista Latina de Comunicación Social. All rights reserved.
