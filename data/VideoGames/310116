As video game development studios increasingly turn to digital crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter for financing, this article explores the ways in which these processes shape production. It examines in particular the interactions that typically occur between studios and players as part of crowdfunded development, analysing the ways in which these activities inform aspects of video game design. By charting the implications of this burgeoning economic model, the article contributes to scholarship concerning video game production and intervenes within more specific discussions concerning the role of the player within development. The article’s case study, which draws from evidence of production concerning multiple Kickstarter projects, is organised into two sections. The first ascertains the degrees to which Kickstarter users can influence the details of a proposed project during a crowdfunding campaign; the second looks at how developers involve crowdfunding communities within production once funding is secured. © The Author(s) 2014.
