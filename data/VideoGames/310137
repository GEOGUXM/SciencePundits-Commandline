Video games have become a global economic, social, and consumption phenomenon. Within the video game industry, massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) have demonstrated unprecedented growth in recent years by attracting more than 50 million consumers who spend in excess of $12. billion annually. Yet, marketing researchers have not paid sufficient attention toward understanding consumption behaviors exhibited by MMORPG players. Drawing from research on MMORPGs, social identity theory, and online communities, this study examines the antecedents and consumption-related outcomes of players' (1) identification with MMORPGs and (2) identification with the MMORPG community. Analysis of data collected from 970 MMORPG players indicates that online games are socially driven and, although attachment with games is important, the relationships forged with fellow players drive consumption behaviors. Theoretical and managerial implications as well as limitations and directions for future research are offered. Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.
