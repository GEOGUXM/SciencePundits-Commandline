Abstract There are several similarities and relationships between behavioral addictions. These relationships between behavioral addictions could be said to result especially from Internet use. It is seen that problematic or excessive use of the Internet not only results in Internet addiction but also leads to and contributes to such other behavioral addictions as video game addiction. The present study examined the associations in related literature with the relationships between video game and Internet addictions and aimed at determining the correlations between video game and Internet addictions. Also, the study further focused on whether the symptom of tolerance occurred in all conditions or not. In the study, correlational research was used. The study was carried out with 200 students from a high school located in the Eastern part of Turkey. Video Game Addiction Questionnaire and Internet Addiction Scale were used to collect the research data. For the analysis of the data, descriptive statistics, TwoStep Cluster Analysis, correlation analysis and Independent Samples t-Test were applied. Consequently, it was found that there was a strong correlation between video game addiction and Internet addiction. Also, not in all conditions can tolerance be said to be among the symptoms of video game addiction or Internet addiction. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
