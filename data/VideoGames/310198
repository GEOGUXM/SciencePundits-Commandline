Video games are traditionally presented and visualized on a screen (flat, portable, touch sensitive or projected) and are mostly restricted by predefined scenarios and character movements. Although the ways in which we interact with games have improved over recent years, the interaction is still limited to their functions and game presets and still happens inside the screen. In this paper we explore new interaction paradigms using i.Ge [4], a video game level editor that allows users to interact with their own environment to create game content with every-day physical objects in real time. At this stage, i.Ge explores new ways to interact with the real world by augmenting it with interactive projections, reducing the gap between the real and the digital world in a spatial augmented reality. We also propose other novel naturalistic approaches to create and interact with digital content that involve embodiment and more use of depth.
