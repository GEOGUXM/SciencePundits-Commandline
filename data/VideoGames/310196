Providing a fair matchmaking system is an essential issue, while developing every online video game. In the article, we show that the currently existing matchmaking system in League of Legends, one of the most popular online video games currently existing, is built on a base of conditions which do not hold true in the presence of empirical data. This, in short, decreases the effectiveness of the ranking system, and negatively affects users experience. Therefore, we propose a new ranking system, which genuinely answers the needs, which arise from League of Legends gameplay. As League of Legends gameplay model is nowadays highly popular amid online video games, the proposed system can be easily generalized and adopted by other online video games that are currently popular among gamers.
