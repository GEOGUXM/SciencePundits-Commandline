Summary: Background: While decreased physical activity and increased sedentary behaviours are incriminated for their role in the progression of obesity, active video games (AVG) may offer a new alternative to increase energy expenditure in youth. This study is the first to examine the effect of a 1-h AVG play on lean and obese adolescents' energy expenditure. Methods: Body composition and aerobic fitness were assessed in 19 obese and 12 lean adolescent boys (12-15 years old). Participants performed a 1-h AVG session (Kinect Sports technology) while wearing a portable indirect calorimeter (K4b2) to assess their energy expenditure and heart rate. Results: Body weight (91.0±9.5 vs. 58.5±12.4kg), body mass index (32.2±3.1 vs. 20.3±1.6kgm-2) and body fat (38.1±2.7 vs. 13.4±3.9%) were significantly higher in obese adolescents (P<0.001). Absolute energy expenditure was significantly higher in obese (P<0.05) but not when corrected for body composition. Maximal heart rate reached during AVG was significantly higher in lean adolescents (190±25 vs. 183±28bpm, P<0.05). Time spent between 3 and 6 METs (Metabolic Equivalent Task) was not different between groups but time spent above 6 METs was higher in lean adolescents (P<0.05). Conclusion: Although lean and obese adolescent boys experienced similar energy expenditure relative to their body size during a 1-h Kinect AVG session, lean adolescents spent more time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. © 2015 World Obesity.
