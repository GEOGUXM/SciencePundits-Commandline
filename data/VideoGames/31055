Studies of human performance in complex tasks using video games are an attractive prospect, but many existing games lack a comprehensive way to modify the game and track performance beyond basic levels of analysis. Meta-T provides experimenters a tool to study behavior in a dynamic task environment with time-stressed decision-making and strong perceptual-motor elements, offering a host of experimental manipulations with a robust and detailed logging system for all user events, system events, and screen objects. Its experimenter-friendly interface provides control over detailed parameters of the task environment without need for programming expertise. Support for eye-tracking and computational cognitive modeling extend the paradigm’s scope. © 2015 Psychonomic Society, Inc.
