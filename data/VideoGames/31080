Several factors influencing the educational outcomes in a blended learning environment have been explored in an attempt to predict student's academic performance and transferable skills. This research explores personality traits, learning style, satisfaction and their correlation to educational outcomes in a blended learning scenario that involved game-based learning strategies, flip teaching techniques and video conferencing sessions. At the end of the semester teachers evaluated the grades and skills of 142 K12 students that participated in the study in order to construct a prediction model and analyze the impact of the personality, learning style and satisfaction on educational outcomes. We constructed two ANFIS models to predict the grades and skills in the given learning setup, and two linear regression models to compare the results with ANFIS models. The ANFIS models explaining about 94% and 92% of variances in grades and skills outperformed the linear regression models explaining 81% and 69% of variances. Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.
