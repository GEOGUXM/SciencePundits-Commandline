The use of the Internet within education has created an urgent need for research into online learning models, delivery methods and curriculum content modifications especially in online physical education (OLPE). Most secondary OLPE courses focus on the cognitive pieces of the curriculum, and to a lesser degree, fitness for life due to a lack of research. The omission of the physical, social and emotional components of the OLPE curriculum has created a rift in the understanding, growth and development of students who take these courses. For this reason, Kinesiology professionals need to take a lead in the development of OLPE curricula through efficacious research. Exergaming has shown positive results for each of these four components when played proximally; however, exergames have not been widely studied in remote Internet settings. An exploration of the present need for more research into the ramifications of OLPE and the role Kinesiology professionals can take in guiding this process along with the potential of exergames in OLPE to fill this curricular void is presented.
