In Joint source-channel coding (JSCC), the source coding improves coding efficiency, while channel coding improves transmission reliability. Due to channel capacity is limited in video transmission, allocation bandwidth between source and channel needs a tradeoff in order to achieve optimum effect of transmission. In this paper, cooperative game theory is used in the part of allocation rate in the JSCC model, and convert it into a static Nash bargaining issues, then solve the Nash equilibrium results. This method makes full use of the channel resources, and optimizes the quality of the video. Â© 2014 IEEE.
