Augmented Reality (AR) refers to the science and technology which enables 3D/2D computer graphics to overlay video frames in real time so as to add contextual information to deepen people's understanding of the real scene. In particular, outdoor AR as an emerging technology opens up new possibilities and applications for Location Based Services (LBS). As with the increasing amount of 3D city models and development of 3D computer graphics technology, insufficient research attention has been put into 3D city model based AR navigation, this paper aims to contribute to outdoor AR tracking research by using 3D city models and a 3D game engine. The camera pose and position are calculated through 2D/3D correspondence between the live video frame and 3D city models. The augmented live video feed is rendered in a 3D game engine while the 3D model runs in the background to facilitate the real time registration of virtual objects into the real scene as well as position determination of the moving camera.
