Motion Games, known as exergames or active video games, have become mainstream, due to technologies such as Microsoft Kinect, PlayStation Move, and Nintendo Wii. More research is needed on how to design and implement motion games that are fun and effective as exercise and motor-learning environments. Researchers have investigated how practicing real skills can be made more motivating in real sports settings. Two approaches are introduced, such as a game played by jumping on a trampoline and an augmented climbing wall that enables getting feedback and playing games on a real climbing wall.
