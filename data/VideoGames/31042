Embedded devices are becoming ubiquitous in both domestic and commercial environments. Although smartphones, tablets, and video game consoles are all labeled by their primary function, most of these devices offer additional features and are capable of additional interactivity. Given the proprietary nature of such devices in terms of hardware and software and the protection mechanisms incorporated into these systems, it is and will continue to be extremely difficult to use “traditional digital forensics” methodologies to access storage media and acquire data for analysis. This paper examines how consumer law may be stifling research that the forensic community could ultimately depend upon to examine devices. © 2015, Taylor & Francis. All rights reserved.
