The effect of violent images on behaviour is now well known and documented. However, the impact of violent video games is a topic of heated debate, relying on scientific literature supporting contradictory conclusions. In summary, violent video games obviously induce more aggressive thoughts and emotions, and an increase in violent behavior in the short term and long term. However, it seems that the use of violent video games is not correlated with an increase in crime. We assume that this paradox can be explained by the complexity of the concept of acting out, and the barriers that exist between the feeling of an individual and their actions.
