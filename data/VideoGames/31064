Asthma is a chronic disease increasing in prevalence in Western cultures. Sedentary behaviors, such as television viewing, video game and computer use, have been associated with poor diet and being overweight. The extent to which these factors were associated with asthma was investigated in a representative sample of U.S. children ages 2–11 years (N = 4133). Results showed low dietary fiber, reported being told your child was overweight by a healthcare provider, and race/ethnicity were associated with asthma; whereas, screen time, fat intake, and meals out were not associated with asthma. Implications for clinical practice and research were discussed. © 2015, Routledge. All rights reserved.
