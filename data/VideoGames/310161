Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may exhibit delayed play skills or repetitive play and have difficulty engaging in spontaneous play with peers.Method A multiple-probe design across participants was used to investigate the effectiveness of a video modelling intervention and the use of children's special interests on their engagement with games and with peers for kindergarten children with ASD.Results Results indicated that all three children with ASD demonstrated increased engagement with the games and social engagement with their peers. Inappropriate behaviour decreased with the intervention. The effects were maintained during the follow-up and generalised to a novel game. Social validity data indicated that the study was meaningful and the intervention was feasible and effective.Conclusion Future research should focus on designing play skills interventions that serve to motivate both children with ASD and their typically developing peers in order to promote more spontaneous and interactive play among them.
