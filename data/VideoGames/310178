In this paper we describe how a video game designed to deliver a rehabilitation therapy can produce data of a standard that is clinically useful. Our approach is based entirely on commodity video game hardware, making our solution one that may be delivered in a cost efficient manner. The step of ensuring data fidelity was crucial in allowing clinical assessment to be derived from standard video game technology without therapist intervention. We achieved this by cutting the data to provide our statistical model with only the information that accurately represented patient activities that contribute to clinical assessment. Â© 2014 IEEE.
