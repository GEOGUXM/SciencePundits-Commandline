The labor of video game testers has barely registered within political-economic analyses of work practices in the game industry. This article addresses this gap through a critical deployment of the concept of precarity and its multiform nature experienced by game testers. Drawing on Harry Braverman's concept of "degradation of labor," I aim to contribute to media labor literature by introducing the concept of "degradation of fun," where testers are alienated from play and forced to develop instrumental and selective ways of play. I make the argument that as opposed to popular representations, game testing is a decidedly precarious labor, due to its assumed low-skill status, and because of the existence of a large reserve army of labor, which depresses the wages and renders testers expendable. Ultimately, the "immateriality" and joy of testing as labor comes with material physical and bodily pains, and sentiments of second-class citizenship. Â© The Author(s) 2014.
