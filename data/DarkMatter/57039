We revisit the multicomponent leptonically decaying dark matter (DM) scenario to explain the possible electron/positron excesses with the recently updated AMS-02 data. We find that both the single- and two-component DM models can fit the positron fraction and e+/e- respective fluxes, in which the two-component ones provide better fits. However, for the single-component models, the recent AMS-02 data on the positron fraction limit the DM cutoff to be smaller than 1Â TeV, which conflicts with the high-energy behavior of the AMS-02 total e++e- flux spectrum, while the two-component DM models do not possess such a problem. We also discuss the constraints from the Fermi-LAT measurement of the diffuse γ-ray spectrum. We show that the two-component DM models are consistent with the current DM lifetime bounds. In contrast, the best-fit DM lifetimes in the single-component models are actually excluded. © 2015 American Physical Society.
