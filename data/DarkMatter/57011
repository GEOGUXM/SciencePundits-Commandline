We present in this paper a LRS Bianchi type I cosmological model with dark matter and anisotropic ghost dark energy in presence of magnetic field. We have solved the Einstein’s field equations with a particular form of Hubble parameter. The physical and geometrical behaviors of the model are discussed. It is observed that the anisotropy of the universe and that of the ghost dark energy tends to zero at late times and the universe becomes spatially homogeneous, isotropic and flat. The coincidence parameter increases with time. We have also studied the statefinder parameters. The results obtained are in agreement with the recent days observations. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
