In some supersymmetric models like split supersymmetry or models with nonuniversal gaugino mass, 'bino [lightest sparticle (LSP)] and wino [next-to-lightest sparticle (NLSP)] may have rather small mass splitting in order to provide the correct dark matter relic density through bino/wino coannihilation. Such a scenario with the compressed bino/wino is difficult to explore at the LHC. In this work we propose to probe this scenario from pp→jχ20χ1± followed by χ20→γχ10 and χ1±→W∗χ10→ ±νχ10 (this method is also applicable to the compressed bino/Higgsino scenario). Through a detailed Monte Carlo simulation for both the signal and the backgrounds, we find that for a mass splitting ΔM∼10-15GeV between bino (LSP) and wino (NLSP), the 14 TeV LHC with a luminosity of 1000fb-1 can probe the wino up to 150 GeV (the sensitivity can reach 3.4σ for ΔM=10GeV and 2σ for ΔM=15GeV). We also investigate the dark matter detection sensitivities for this scenario and find that the planned XENON-1T (2017) cannot fully cover the parameter space with a wino below 150 GeV allowed by relic density and the LUX limits. © 2015 American Physical Society.
