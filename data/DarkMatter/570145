We study the capture of galactic dark matter particles (DMP) in two-body and few-body systems with a symplectic map description. This approach allows modeling the scattering of 1016 DMPs after following the time evolution of the captured particle on about 109 orbital periods of the binary system. We obtain the DMP density distribution inside such systems and determine the enhancement factor of their density in a center vicinity compared to its galactic value as a function of the mass ratio of the bodies and the ratio of the body velocity to the velocity of the galactic DMP wind. We find that the enhancement factor can be on the order of tens of thousands. Â© ESO, 2015.
