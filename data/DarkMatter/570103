In this paper, we have considered varying modified Chaplygin gas in case of variable G and Λ. Since varying G and Λ give rises to modified form of field equations and conservation law, we have considered two different toy models. In the first model, the Universe is filled with a phenomenological gas while in the second one, there is the existence of gas and a matter with P = ω(t)ρ<inf>m</inf>. By considering sign changeable interaction between fluids we have analyzed important cosmological parameters such as EoS parameter of the fluids and deceleration parameter q of the models. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
