The objective of this paper is to discuss the Chameleon Brans-Dicke gravity with non-minimally matter coupling of scalar field. We take modified Holographic Ricci dark energy model in this gravity with its energy density in interaction with energy density of cold dark matter. We assume power-law ansatz for scale factor and scalar field to discuss potential as well as coupling functions in the evolving universe. These reconstructed functions are plotted versus scalar field and time for different values of power component of scale factor n. We observe that potential and coupling functions represent increasing behavior, in particular, consistent results for a specific value of n. Finally, we have examined validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics and we have observed its validity for all values of n. Â© 2015 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.
