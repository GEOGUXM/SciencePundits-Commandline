We show that dark matter consisting of bosons of mass of about 1 eV or less has a critical temperature exceeding the temperature of the Universe at all times, and hence would have formed a Bose-Einstein condensate at very early epochs. We also show that the wavefunction of this condensate, via the quantum potential it produces, gives rise to a cosmological constant that may account for the correct dark energy content of our Universe. We argue that massive gravitons or axions are viable candidates for these constituents. In the far future this condensate is all that remains of our Universe. Â© 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.
