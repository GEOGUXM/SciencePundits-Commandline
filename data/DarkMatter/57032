We present a nonperturbative calculation of the strangeness of the nucleon yN within the framework of lattice QCD. This observable is known to be an important cornerstone to interpret results from direct dark matter detection experiments. We perform a lattice computation for yN with an analysis of systematic effects originating from discretization, finite size, chiral extrapolation and excited state effects leading to the value of yN=0.173(50). The rather large uncertainty of this value of yN is dominated by systematic uncertainties which we are able to quantify in this work. Â© 2015 American Physical Society.
