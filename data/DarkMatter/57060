The theoretical and numerical studies have been made to observe the planar and nonplanar geometries for the nonlinear propagation of the dust-electron-acoustic (DEA) in a dusty plasma (containing initially cold and hot Maxwellian electrons, stationary ions, and charge fluctuating stationary dust grains) using reductive perturbation method. It has also been found that the basic features of the DEA waves are significantly modified by the presence of dust charge fluctuation. The numerical solution to the K-dV equation indicates that the parameters those we have considered in our model blatantly influence the propagation speed and the structure of DEA solitary waves. The geometrical effects on the structure of DEA wave are discussed. It is shown that the amplitude and propagation speed in spherical geometry is larger compared with cylindrical and planar geometries for different values of the above-mentioned parameters. The implications of our results would be useful to understand some astrophysical and cosmological scenarios like stellar polytropes, hadronic matter and quark-gluon plasma, protoneutron stars, and dark-matter halos.
