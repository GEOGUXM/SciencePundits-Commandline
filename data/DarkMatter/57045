In the leftright twin Higgs (LRTH) model, the neutral ͈ is a candidate for weakly interacting massive particle dark matter (DM). If its mass is lighter than half of the standard model-like Higgs boson h, the new invisible decay h → ͈͈ will become open. In this paper, we examine the status of a light DM (͈) under current experimental constraints including the latest LHC Higgs data, the XENON100 and LUX limit on the DM scattering off the nucleon. The following observations have been obtained: (i) the current ATLAS (CMS) measurements of R<inf>γγ</inf> can exclude the invisible Higgs branching ratio Br<inf>inv</inf> larger than 34% (48%) at 2σ level; (ii) the Global fits to the latest LHC and Tevatron Higgs data provide a stronger constraint: Br<inf>inv</inf> < 20% (30%) at 2σ (3σ) level, which could be tested in the LHC experiments; (iii) for the spinindependent scattering cross section off the nucleon, the recent XENON100 (LUX) data can exclude the invisible decay rate larger than 50% (25%); and (iv) the results of direct DM searches with LUX can give strong constraint on the viable parameter space of {g<inf>h͈͈</inf>, m<inf>͈</inf>} in this LRTH model. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.
