A two component model of nonthermal dark matter is formulated to simultaneously explain the Fermi-LAT results indicating a γ-ray excess observed from our Galactic Centre in the 1–3 GeV energy range and the detection of an X-ray line at 3.55 keV from extragalactic sources. Two additional Standard Model singlet scalar fields S<inf>2</inf> and S<inf>3</inf> are introduced. These fields couple among themselves and with the Standard Model Higgs doublet H. The interaction terms among the scalar fields, namely H, S<inf>2</inf> and S<inf>3</inf>, are constrained by the application of a discrete ℤ<inf>2</inf> × ℤ<inf>2</inf>′ symmetry which breaks softly to a remnant ℤ<inf>2</inf>′ ′ symmetry. This residual discrete symmetry is then spontaneously broken through an MeV order vacuum expectation value u of the singlet scalar field S<inf>3</inf>. The resultant physical scalar spectrum has the Standard Model like Higgs as χ<inf>1</inf> with Mχ1∼125 GeV, a moderately heavy scalar χ<inf>2</inf> with 50 GeV ≤ Mχ2≤80 GeV and a light χ<inf>3</inf> with Mχ3∼7 keV. There is only tiny mixing between χ<inf>1</inf> and χ<inf>2</inf> as well as between χ<inf>1</inf> and χ<inf>3</inf>. The lack of importance of domain wall formation in the present scenario from the spontaneous breaking of the discrete symmetry ℤ<inf>2</inf>′ ′, provided u ≤ 10 MeV, is pointed out. We find that our proposed two component dark matter model is able to explain successfully both the above mentioned phenomena — the Fermi-LAT observed γ-ray excess (from the χ2→bb¯ decay mode) and the observation of the X-ray line (from the decay channel χ<inf>3</inf> → γγ) by the XMM-Newton observatory. © 2015, The Author(s).
