An attempt has been made to analyse the the role of octonions in various unified field theories associated with dyons and the dark matter. Starting with the split octonion algebra and its properties, we have discussed the octonionic unified gauge formulation for SU(2)×U(1) electroweak theory and SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) grand unified theory. Describing the octonion eight dimensional space as the combination of two quaternionic spaces (namely associated with the electromagnetic interaction (EM-space) and linear gravitational interaction (G-space)), we have reexamined the unified picture of EM-G space in terms of octonionic split formulation in consistent manner. Consequently, we have obtained the various field equations for unified gravi-electromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, we have reconstructed the field equations of hot and cold dark matter in terms of split octonions. It is shown that the difference between the octonion cold dark matter (OCDM) and the octonion hot dark matter (OHDM) is significant in the formulating of structure of these two, because the velocities of octonion hot dark matter cause it to wipe out structure on small scales. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
