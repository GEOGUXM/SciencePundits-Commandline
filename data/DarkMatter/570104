We examine dark matter production rates in supersymmetric (SUSY) axion models typified by the mass hierarchy m3/2am(neutralino)am(axino). In such models, one expects the dark matter to be composed of an axion/gravitino admixture. After presenting motivation for how such a mass hierarchy might arise, we examine dark matter production in the SUSY Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (KSVZ) model, the SUSY Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) model and a hybrid model containing contributions from both KSVZ and DFSZ. Gravitinos can be produced thermally and also nonthermally from axino, saxion or neutralino decay. We obtain upper bounds on TR due to overproduction of gravitinos including both the thermal and nonthermal processes. For TR near the upper bound, dark matter tends to be gravitino dominated, but for TR well below the upper bounds, axion domination is more typical although in many cases we find a comparable mixture of both axions and gravitinos. In this class of models, we ultimately expect detection of relic axions but no weakly interacting massive particle signal, although SUSY should ultimately be discovered at colliders.
