We show that a neutral scalar field, σ, of two-Higgs-doublet extensions of the Standard Model incorporating the seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses can be identified as a consistent warm dark matter candidate with a mass of order keV. The relic density of σ is correctly reproduced by virtue of the late decay of a right-handed neutrino N participating in the seesaw mechanism. Constraints from cosmology determine the mass and lifetime of N to be MN≈25GeV-20TeV and τN≈(10-4-1)sec. These models can also explain the 3.5 keV X-ray anomaly in the extragalactic spectrum that has been recently reported in terms of the decay σ→γγ. Future tests of these models at colliders and in astrophysical settings are outlined. © 2015 American Physical Society.
