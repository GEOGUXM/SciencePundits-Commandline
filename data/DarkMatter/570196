We present the spectroscopic confirmation of a z = 2.45 protocluster. Its member galaxies lie within a radius of 1.4 Mpc (physical) on the sky and within along the line of sight. We estimate an overdensity of 10, suggesting that the structure has made the turnaround but is not assembled yet. A comparison to the Millennium simulation suggests that analogous structures evolve into 1014-1015 Mo h-1 type dark matter halos by z = 0, qualifying the notion of "protocluster." The search for the complete census of mock progenitor galaxies at of these massive z = 0 mock clusters reveals that they are widely spread over areas with a diameter of 3-20 Mpc. This suggests that the optical selection of such protoclusters can result in a rich diversity regarding their z = 0 descendants. We also searched for signs of environmental differentiation in this protocluster. While we see a weak trend for more massive and more quiescent galaxies within the protocluster, this is not statistically significant. Â© 2015. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..
