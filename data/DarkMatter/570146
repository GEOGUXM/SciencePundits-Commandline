In this paper we present results from the Mapping Dark Matter competition that expressed the weak lensing shape measurement task in its simplest form and as a result attracted over 700 submissions in 2 months and a factor of 3 improvement in shape measurement accuracy on high signal to noise galaxies, over previously published results, and a factor 10 improvement over methods tested on constant shear blind simulations. We also review weak lensing shape measurement challenges, including the Shear TEsting Programmes (STEP1 and STEP2) and the GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing competitions (GREAT08 and GREAT10).
