Considering the generalized minimal supergravity model in the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model, we study the electroweak supersymmetry, in which the squarks and/or gluino are heavy around a few TeVs while the sleptons, sneutrinos, bino, winos, and/or Higgsinos are light within 1 TeV. We resolve the (g-2)μ/2 discrepancy for the muon anomalous magnetic moment in the Standard Model successfully and identify a parameter space in which such solutions also have the electroweak fine-tuning measures ΔEW 16.5 (6%) and ΔEW 25 (4%) without and with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) bounds, respectively. We find that the allowed mass ranges, which are consistent within 3σ of the g-2 discrepancy, for the lightest neutralino, charginos, stau, stau neutrinos, and first two-family sleptons are [44, 390], [100, 700], [100, 700], [52, 800], and [150, 800] GeV, respectively. Moreover, our solutions satisfy the latest bounds reported by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations on electroweakinos and sleptons. The colored sparticles such as light stop, gluinos, and the first the first two generations of squark masses have been found in the mass ranges of [500, 3000], [1300, 4300], and [1800, 4200] GeV, respectively. To obtain the observed dark matter relic density for the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) neutralino, we have the bino-wino, LSP neutralino-stau, and LSP neutralino-tau sneutrinos coannihilation scenarios and the resonance solutions such as the A pole, Higgs pole, and Z pole. We identify the Higgsino-like LSP neutralino and display its spin-independent and spin-dependent cross sections with nucleons. We present ten benchmark points that can be tested at the up coming collider searches as well. © 2015 American Physical Society.
