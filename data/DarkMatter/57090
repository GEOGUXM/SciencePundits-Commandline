We simulate tidal streams in the presence and absence of substructures inside the zero-redshift snapshot of the Via Lactea II (VL-2) simulation. A halo finder is used to remove and isolate the subhalos found inside the high-resolution dark matter halo of VL-2, and the potentials for both the main halo and all the subhalos are constructed individually using the self-consistent field method. This allows us to make direct comparison of tidal streams between a smooth halo and a lumpy halo without assuming idealized profiles or triaxial fits. We simulate the kinematics of a star cluster starting with the same orbital position but two different velocities. Although these two orbits are only moderately eccentric and have similar apo- and pericentric distances, we find that the two streams have very different morphologies. We conclude that our model of the potential of VL-2 can provide insights about tidal streams that have not been explored by previous studies using idealized or axisymmetric models. Â© 2015.
