We consider a scenario, within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model, in which dark matter is binolike and dark matter-nucleon spin-independent scattering occurs via the exchange of light squarks which exhibit left-right mixing. We show that direct detection experiments such as LUX and SuperCDMS will be sensitive to a wide class of such models through spin-independent scattering. Moreover, these models exhibit properties, such as isospin violation, that are not typically observed for the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model lightest supersymmetric particle if scattering occurs primarily through Higgs exchange. The dominant nuclear physics uncertainty is the quark content of the nucleon, particularly the strangeness content. Â© 2015 American Physical Society.
