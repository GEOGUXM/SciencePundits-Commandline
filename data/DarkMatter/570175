We consider a class of fermionic dark matter candidates that are charged under both the SU(2)L and U(1)Y gauge interactions. In this case a certain amount of dark matter-Higgs couplings, which can split the dark matter into a pair of Majorana fermions, should be present to evade the constraints from the dark matter direct detection experiments. These effects may be probed by means of the dark matter-nucleus scattering via the Higgs-boson exchange process, as well as the electric dipole moments induced by the dark matter and its SU(2)L partner fields. In this article, we evaluate them with an effective field approach. It turns out that the constraints coming from the experiments for the quantities have already restricted the dark matter with hypercharge Y≥3/2. Future experiments have sensitivities to probe this class of dark matter candidates, and may disfavor the Y≥1 cases if no signal is observed. In this case, only the Y=0 and 1/2 cases may be the remaining possibilities for the SU(2)L charged fermionic dark matter candidates. © 2015 American Physical Society.
