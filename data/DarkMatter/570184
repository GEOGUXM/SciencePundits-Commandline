The observed Higgs mass MH=125.9±0.4GeV leads to the criticality of the standard model, that is, the Higgs potential becomes flat around the scale 1017-18GeV for the top mass 171.3 GeV. Earlier we proposed a Higgs inflation scenario in which this criticality plays a crucial role. In this paper, we investigate the detailed cosmological predictions of this scenario in light of the latest Planck and BICEP2 results. We also consider the Higgs portal scalar dark matter model, and compute the Higgs one-loop effective potential with the two-loop renormalization group improvement. We find a constraint on the coupling between the Higgs boson and dark matter which depends on the inflationary parameters. © 2015 American Physical Society.
