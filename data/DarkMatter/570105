The limitations of doublet-septet mixing models resulting from the deviations of electroweak oblique parameters ΔS and ΔT are studied. In the minimal model, the mixture of the septet η and the scalar doublet in the standard model (SM) is driven by a non-Hermitian dimension-7 operator. For a smaller bare mass of the septet, ΔS puts a stringent constraint on the mixing angle sinβ between the CP-odd neutral parts of the SM Higgs doublet and η. In general, increasing the mass of the scalar septet Mη will enhance the deviation of T from the SM, whereas it decreases the magnitude of ΔS for a larger bare mass within the range Mη 400GeV. We also examine two extended models from the ordinary doublet-septet mixture pattern. One of them is based on an inert doublet-septet mixing pattern, in which there is no vacuum expectation value for the neutral component of η and stable dark matter could naturally exist. For a benchmark point with the inner doublet mass of Mχ=250 and Mη=400GeV in this model, the mixing coefficient is found to be less than 1.8. The other extension is constructed by imposing a doubly charged scalar mixed with the doubly charged component of the septet. Apart from the contribution by the septet-doublet admixture, ΔS is suppressed by a factor of sW2 and ΔT has a significant constraint due to the vanishing vacuum polarization of Z at the momentum transfer p2=0. © 2015 American Physical Society.
