In this paper we present the discussion on the salient points of the computational analysis that are at the basis of the paper Rotation Curves of Galaxies by Fourth Order Gravity (Stabile and Scelza, Phys. Rev. D, 84:124023, 2011). In fact in this paper any galactic component (bulge, disk and Dark matter component) required an onerous numerical computation since the Gauss theorem is not applicable in the Fourth Order Gravity. The computational and data analysis have been made with the software Mathematica®. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
