Some important fruit characteristics of twelve promising cornelian cherry selections from Montenegro were presented. Average fruit mass and flesh ratio of promising selections ranged from 1.90 g (BA-13) to 4.40 g (BR-135) and 83.16 % (BA-13) to 88.63 % (BR-135). External fruit color was dark red in the majority of selections but there were also selections with a red and yellow color. The selections had a total dry matter content between 18.83 % (BP-07) and 27.73 % (BP-54); total acid content between 1.65 % (BP-38) and 3.54 % (BP-07); total sugar content between 10.42 % (PL-99) and 17.52 % (BR-135), reducing sugar content between 8.73 % (BP-21) and 15.78 % (BR-135); sucrose content between 0.29 % (BP-38) and 3.51 % (BA-13); ash content between 0.65 % (BP-07) and 1.59 % (ŽB-143); Ca-pectate content between 1.03 % (BA-13) and 2.47 % (BP-51) and vitamin C content between 52 mg/100 g (BP-07) and 103 mg/100 g (ŽB-143). The results showed that a particularly high content of pectin and vitamin C of the selections make them suitable for table use and various forms of processing. The selection BR-135 was found to be the most promising overall for the best fruit mass and chemical composition characteristics, except its vitamin C content. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg
