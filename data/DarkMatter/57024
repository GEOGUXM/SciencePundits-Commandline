In this paper, by using the effective potential for the photons, we analysis the null geodesics and all kinds of orbits corresponding to the energy levels for the Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter black hole surrounded by quintessence with ω<inf>q</inf>= -2/3 and compare our results with those obtained for the Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence matter. We also investigate the circular orbits and calculate the angle of deflection of the photons. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
