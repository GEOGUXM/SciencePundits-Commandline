In this paper, we analyze the behavior of pilgrim dark energy with G-O cutoff scale in modified Horava-Lifshitz F(R) gravity through correspondence scenario. We consider three well-known scale factors in which one scale factor describes the unification of matter dominated and accelerated phases and others are intermediate and bouncing forms. We obtain the $F(\tilde{R})$ models for these scale factors and obtain increasing behavior with the passage of time. We also extract equation of state parameter corresponding to these models. We observe that this parameter shows transition from phantom towards quintessence by crossing the phantom divide line in all cases. We also give comparison of our results of equation of state parameter with observational constraints. Â© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
