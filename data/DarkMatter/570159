This paper is devoted to discuss the evolution of Ricci dark energy with variable gravitational constant in the Kaluza-Klein universe. We study both the non-interacting and interacting cases of Ricci dark energy with dark matter and obtain the equation-of-state parameter for our model. Also, the generalized second law of thermodynamics has been studied for our model. © 2015, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
