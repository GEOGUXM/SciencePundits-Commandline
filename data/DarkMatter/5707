Electron tomography (ET) using different imaging modes has been progressively consolidating its position as a key tool in materials science. The fidelity of a tomographic reconstruction, or tomogram, is affected by several experimental factors. Most often, an unrealistic cloud of intensity that does not correspond to a real material phase of the specimen ("dark matter") blurs the tomograms and enhances artefacts arising from the missing wedge (MW). Here we show that by simple preprocessing of the background level of any tomographic tilt series, it is possible to minimise the negative effects of that "dark matter". Iterative reconstruction algorithms converge better, leading to tomograms with fewer streaking artefacts from the MW, more contrast, and increased accuracy. The conclusions are valid irrespective of the imaging mode used, and the methodology improves the segmentation and visualisation of tomograms of both crystalline and amorphous materials. We show examples of HAADF STEM and BF TEM tomography. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
