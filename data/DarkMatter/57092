A simple extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model in which baryon and lepton numbers are local gauge symmetries spontaneously broken at the supersymmetry scale is reported. This theory provides a natural explanation for proton stability. Despite violating R-parity, it contains a dark matter candidate carrying baryon number that can be searched for in direct detection experiments. The model accommodates a light active neutrino spectrum and predicts one heavy and two light sterile neutrinos. It also allows for lepton number violating processes testable at the Large Hadron Collider. Â© 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.
