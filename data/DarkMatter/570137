We show that the baryon-dark-matter coincidence problem can be solved in the constrained minimal supersymmetric model. Baryons and dark matter are generated simultaneously through the late-time decay of nontopological solitons, Q-balls, which are formed after the Affleck-Dine baryogenesis. A certain relation between the universal scalar mass m0 and the universal gaugino mass M1/2 is required to solve the coincidence problem, marginally depending on the other parameters, and the result can be consistent with the observation of the 126-GeV Higgs boson. We also investigate the detectability in dark-matter direct-search experiments. Â© 2015 American Physical Society.
