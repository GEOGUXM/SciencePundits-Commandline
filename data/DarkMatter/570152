Sequencing of complete plant genomes has become increasingly more routine since the advent of the next-generation sequencing technology. Identification and annotation of large amounts of noncoding but functional DNA sequences, including cis-regulatory DNA elements (CREs), have become a new frontier in plant genome research. Genomic regions containing active CREs bound to regulatory proteins are hypersensitive to DNase I digestion and are called DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs). Several recent DHS studies in plants illustrate that DHS datasets produced by DNase I digestion followed by next-generation sequencing (DNase-seq) are highly valuable for the identification and characterization of CREs associated with plant development and responses to environmental cues. DHS-based genomic profiling has opened a door to identify and annotate the 'dark matter' in sequenced plant genomes. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
