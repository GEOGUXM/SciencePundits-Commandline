Collider searches for energetic particles recoiling against missing transverse energy (ET) allow us to place strong bounds on the interactions between dark matter (DM) and standard model (SM) particles. In this article we update and extend LHC constraints on effective dimension-7 operators involving DM and electroweak gauge bosons. A concise comparison of the sensitivity of the monophoton, mono-W, mono-Z, mono-W/Z, and invisible Higgs-boson decays in the vector boson fusion mode and the monojet channel is presented. Depending on the parameter choices, either the monophoton or the monojet data provide the most stringent bounds at the moment. We furthermore explore the potential of improving the current 8 TeV limits at 14 TeV. Future strategies capable of disentangling the effects of the different effective operators involving electroweak gauge bosons are discussed as well. Â© Published by the American Physical Society.
