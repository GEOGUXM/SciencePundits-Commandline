We propose a model with a real SU(2) triplet fermion and a sterile neutrino, both of which are odd under a conserved Z2 symmetry. With all new physics confined to the Z2-odd sector, whose low energy manifestation is in some higher-dimensional operators, a fermionic dark matter candidate is found to emerge. We identify the region of the parameter space of the scenario, which is consistent with all constraints from relic density and direct searches, and allows a wide range of masses for the dark matter candidate.
