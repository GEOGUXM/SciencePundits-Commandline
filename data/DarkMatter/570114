The interacting framework of modified QCD ghost dark energy with cold dark matter is being considered for illustrating the accelerated expansion of the universe. We develop the Hubble parameter numerically and find that it shows increasing behavior which is consistent with the present observations. Also, the equation state parameter shows evolution of the universe from matter dominated universe towards phantom era by evolving the quintessence as well as vacuum eras of the universe. The dynamics of scalar field and corresponding potential of various scalar field models shows consistence behavior with the accelerated expansion phenomenon. Also, the kinetic energy term of k-essence and dilaton models lies within the range where equation of state parameter represents the accelerated expansion of the universe.
