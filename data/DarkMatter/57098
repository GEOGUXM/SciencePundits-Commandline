I propose a new paradigm to understand expansion. In a non-preserving mass theory, space expansion is driven by a slow continuous mass (or energy) erosion process. I show that this proposal is formally equivalent to an additional cosmic “evolution” force, which was suggested previously to explain the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies. The energy equation shows how expansion is related to gravitation and mass erosion. According to this theory, the fundamental rectilinear movement is exponential in time. More generally, it is also shown how space, time and mass are inter-dependent. A cosmological equation is then obtained, similar to the FRW equation. This proposal confirms Masreliez’s SEC theory and is a candidate to replace dark matter and dark energy hypotheses. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
