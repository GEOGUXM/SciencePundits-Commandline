We perform a dynamical analysis for the exponential scalar field with non-minimally derivative coupling. For the quintessence case, the stable fixed points are the same with and without the non-minimally derivative coupling. For the phantom case, the attractor with dark energy domination exists for the minimal coupling only. For the non-minimally derivative coupling without the standard canonical kinetic term, only the de Sitter attractor exists, and the dark matter solution is unstable. Â© 2015, The Author(s).
