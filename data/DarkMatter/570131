We investigate the Affleck-Dine baryogenesis after D-term inflation with a positive Hubble-induced mass term for a B-L flat direction. It stays at a large field value during D-term inflation, and just after inflation ends it starts to oscillate around the origin of the potential due to the positive Hubble-induced mass term. The phase direction is kicked by higher-dimensional Kähler potentials to generate the B-L asymmetry. The scenario predicts nonzero baryonic isocurvature perturbations, which would be detected by future observations of CMB fluctuations. We also provide a D-term inflation model which naturally explains the coincidence of the energy density of baryon and dark matter. © 2015 American Physical Society.
