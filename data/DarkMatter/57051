We investigate the possibility to test a simple theory for spontaneous baryon number violation at the Large Hadron Collider. In this context the baryon number is a local gauge symmetry spontaneously broken at the low scale through the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism. This theory predicts the existence of a leptophobic neutral gauge boson and a fermionic dark matter candidate with baryon number. We study the gauge boson and Higgs decays, and explore the connection between collider signatures and constraints coming from dark matter experiments. We point out an upper bound on the symmetry breaking scale using the relic density constraints, which tells us that this model can be tested or ruled out at current or future collider experiments.
