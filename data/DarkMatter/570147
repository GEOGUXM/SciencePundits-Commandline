Current bounds from several astrophysical and laboratory observations are pointing towards new paradigms for dark matter properties. Through a complete analysis of this landscape and a comparison between experimental data, guided by a criterion for simplicity, one can try to solve the puzzling question of what dark matter really is and behaves. In this work I try to highlight the hints that allow us to establish concrete sentences about dark matter, for what concerns annihilation cross section, interaction cross sections, mass and spin. The emerging scenario shows that this particle is characterized by a fundamental collisionless behavior, which defines it even better that the inability to interact with light, and it must be very heavy — lying in the 1–10 TeV mass range — in order to satisfy all the constraints. © 2015, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
