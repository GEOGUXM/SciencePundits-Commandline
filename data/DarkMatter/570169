Abstract: We investigate the possibility of satisfying the SU(5) boundary condition Yd = YeT at the GUT scale within the renormalizable R-parity conserving Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Working in the super-CKM basis, we consider non-zero flavour off-diagonal entries in the soft SUSY-breaking mass matrices and the A-terms. At the same time, the diagonal A-terms are assumed to be suppressed by the respective Yukawa couplings. We show that a non-trivial flavour structure of the soft SUSY-breaking sector can contribute to achieving precise Yukawa coupling unification for all three families, and that the relevant flavour-violating parameters are (Formula presented.). We indicate the parameter space regions where the Yukawa unification condition can be satisfied, and we demonstrate that it is consistent with a wide set of experimental constraints, including flavour and electroweak observables, Higgs physics and the LHC bounds. However, as a consequence of the down-electron Yukawa unification requirement, the MSSM vacuum in our scenario is metastable, though long-lived. We also point out that the lightest neutralino needs to be almost purely bino-like and relatively light, with the mass in the ballpark of 250 GeV. Since the proper value of the dark matter relic density is in this case obtained through co-annihilation with a sneutrino, at least one generation of sleptons must be light. Such a clear experimental prediction makes the flavour-violating SU(5) Yukawa unification scenario fully testable at the LHC √S=14 TeV with the 3-lepton searches for electroweakino production. © 2015, The Author(s).
