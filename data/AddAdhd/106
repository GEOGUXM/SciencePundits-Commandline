While in the past two decades attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been recognized as a disorder that persists into adulthood in most cases, the development of empirically supported therapies for affected individuals beyond childhood has lagged considerably. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and related approaches, however, lead the developing literature in this area, at least with regard to psychosocial interventions. The articles in the current special series expand upon this existing work by demonstrating how treatment can (a) be extended to adolescent and college student groups, (b) incorporate a romantic couples approach, (c) productively add mindfulness as an active therapy component, and (d) engage clients in identifying and adaptively weighing overly optimistic thoughts that may be all too common for those with ADHD. Each article provides a theoretical and research review along with descriptions of interventions and case examples, maximizing the utility for clinicians and researchers alike. Â© 2015.
