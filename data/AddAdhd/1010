A key variable in the success of a juvenile justice diversion program (i.e., avoiding reoffending) is completing the program. Little is known about which variables predict successful completion. The present study examined demographics; behavioral histories; current behaviors; and family, school, and social issues among participants drawn from a metropolitan Detroit diversion program. Logistic regression analyses identified variables predictive of program completion. Key predictors included race, aggressive behavior, previous counseling or treatment, poor academic performance, diagnosed with ADD/ADHD, and parental reports of not contributing to household chores. Recommendations for modifying diversion programs based on these findings are offered. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
