Two patients with a psychotic disorder who also met the diagnostic criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were treated with antipsychotics and methylphenidate. The first patient remained stable for many years with this combination treatment, whereas the second became psychotic several months after he had increased the dose of methylphenidate and had started to use cocaine. In the light of these two case studies, we have reviewed the literature on ADD psychosis, and we formulate recommendations regarding the specialised treatment needed for this uncommon disorder.
