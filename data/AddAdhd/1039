Interest in attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD) is growing, as evidenced by the number of scientific publications on the topic, as well as by the number of requests for child psychiatric consultations to diagnose ADD. The current clinical consensus is the result of the long evolution of a historical dichotomy between advocates for an organogenetic or psychopathological etiology of the disorder. Today, we question whether a "double reading" is possible taking into consideration both neuro-developmental factors as well as psychopathological elements? The contribution of complexity theorists and developmental phenomenology could help to conceptualize the ADD/ADHD as a complex and multifactorial disorder, which would support a "transversal" therapeutic approach involving psychoanalytical and psychopharmacology. However, questions remain regarding the effectiveness of psychoanalytical therapy and its association with pharmacotherapy in treating ADHD - and there appears to be little evidence of its effectiveness in existing literature. Thus, the possibility of a future therapeutic consensus for ADHD could be expected. Â© 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.
