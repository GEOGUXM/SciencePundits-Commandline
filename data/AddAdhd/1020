Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are subjects that are being written about daily around the world from different perspectives. The obvious reason is due to the overall involvement of the individual and the persistence of the disorder throughout his or her life. Here I seek to detect its relationship with violence. Google Scholar was used as a search engine on the topic and an extensive literature review was performed on journals over the last four years, national and international thesis and books focusing on the issue of violence. Genetics, social and emotional repercussions, and prevalence of the disorder was established on those suffering with ADD and ADHD. The disorder affects them generally and throughout their life, and there is growing evidence of the close relationship between ADHD and violence-aggression. It is a worldwide prevalent disorder, a public health problem that involves all levels of society, the judicial system, educational institutions and health organizations. In accordance, attention to this segment of the population must be multidisciplinary and because of its prevalence, it is a costly disorder.
