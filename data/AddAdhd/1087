In light of recent evidence suggesting the academic benefits of personal best (PB) goals for students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), this article explores practical approaches to implementing PB goals in the counselling and classroom context. Beginning with a brief summary of how and why PB goals impact academic outcomes and the relevance of this to students with ADHD, concrete steps to implementing PB goals are described. Following this, the broader concept of academic growth is discussed, along with some guidance as to how to operationalise growth approaches with students. Taken together, a greater focus on academically at-risk students' personal trajectories is suggested as a potentially fruitful approach to enhancing their educational outcomes.
