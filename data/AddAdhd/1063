Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a central nervous system disorder affecting 2 out of every 1000 births. CP limits a person's muscular function. Rehabilitative, touch-screen gaming promises to assist in developing muscle tone and dexterity for hemi-paretic CP patients as well as help therapists keep track of a patient's performance over time. However, most systems fail to take into account other factors of the disorder that could affect the scoring of a patient differently on various assessment days - specifically attention deficit or distraction. Cerebral Palsy is frequently associated with diagnosed Attention Deficit (Hyperactive) Disorder (ADD/ADHD), but even if a child does not fall within that definition, pediatric CP patients are often easily distracted. In this work we perform attention deficit simulation experiments with able-bodied users playing three rehabilitative games as well as similar computer generated data and propose a methodology to model and eliminate the effects of attention deficit or distraction from the scoring scheme used to evaluate the patient's motor abilities and progress over time.
