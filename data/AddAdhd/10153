What's new in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)? Advances in genomic medicine and neuroimaging are knocking on the door of clinicians. In October of 2010, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry held its 57th Meeting in New York. One of the most important aspects discussed was the incorporation of new clinical diagnoses to the new DSM-5 classification (fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). The concepts inherent to the ADHD definition are currently being revised. In 2012, the next classification of the American Academy of Psychiatry will include a new subtype of ADHD, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: Inattentive Presentation (Restrictive). Also, one of the main goals of the new classification is to identify the different subtypes of ADHD with unique clinical, neuroimaging, and genetic features, which may lead to specific treatments. Currently, the diagnosis is mostly clinical; however, future developments will lead to optimization of the diagnosis of ADHD and its subtypes. Â© 1997 Pediatria Catalana.
