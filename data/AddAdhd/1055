This qualitative research explored parents' perspectives of parenting a child with AD/HD-Combined subtype (CT) who was unmedicated. Sixteen parents were interviewed twice and two parents were interviewed once. Data were analysed using grounded theory methods. Findings indicated that parents' perspectives were primarily concerned with trying to control their child's difficult behaviours. The substantive theory of Gaining Control that emerged explains the processes that parents used to try to control these behaviours. Two parental controlling/coping pathways were identified. An emotional pathway was associated with negative parental behaviours, poor outcomes, and high distress. The cognitive pathway was associated with surprisingly positive outcomes and low levels of distress. Important outcomes identified included achieving a positive cooperative relationship and highly elevated volitional performance. Processes and subprocesses are described and explained in detail. These findings may have significant clinical and educational implications for enhancing outcomes for the parents and their child. Â© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
