Objective: The goal of our study was to compare the incidence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) observed in students at the School of Physical Education and Sports (SPES), which is a school that provides higher education in athletics, with that observed in students studying in other departments of the university. Our hypothesis was that people with ADHD most commonly turn to sports. Method: The study enrolled 318 (75.7% of 420) students who were studying in the SPES of Gaziantep University; 277 students from the medical, nursing, administration, and engineering faculties were enrolled to serve as a control group. All students enrolled in the study were informed about the study before the lesson, and the students who agreed to participate provided written consent. Scales used in this study were: a sociodemographic information form which was prepared by the investigators, the Wender-Utah Rating Scale (WURS), and the Adult ADD/ADHD DSM-IV Based Diagnostic Screening and Rating Scale (ADD/ADHD). Results: WURS scores were significantly higher (25.07 ± 15.15 versus 21.37 ± 14.28; p = 0.002) in the SPES group than the control group. In addition, the percentage of subjects with a WURS score above the cut-off of 36 was higher in the SPES group than the control group (22.4% versus 15.2%; p: 0.028). The two groups were not significantly different in terms of the subscales of the ADD/ADHD scale. A correlation was found between the educational achievement of the students in the SPES group and the ADD/ADHD-inattention subscale (r = .111, p = 0.015) and WURS scale (r = .113, p = 0.011). Conclusions: More systematic studies with larger samples in this domain will be useful in obtaining a clearer picture regarding professional attraction of people with ADHD to sports. © 2013, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.
