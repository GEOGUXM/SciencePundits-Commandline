Research has shown that males, on average, exhibit lower levels of self-control compared to females. While previous research points to socialization processes as a way to explain the gender gap, the current study investigates whether there are genetic differences in self-control that are operating across the sexes in adolescence and adulthood. First, the results revealed that the same genetic factors influence levels of self-control in males and females. This implies that the genetic influences on self-control are not gender-specific. Second, the results also revealed that the magnitude of the genetic effects on self-control is the same across the sexes. These findings are aligned with other studies that have found no significant sex differences in the genetic effects on constructs related to low self-control, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other self-regulatory problems. The implications of these findings for Gottfredson and Hirschi's theory are discussed. Â© 2013 Copyright Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.
