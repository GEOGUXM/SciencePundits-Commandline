This article is a reaction to the following three statements that were included in a brochure published by Division 29 (Psychotherapy) of the American Psychological Association (APA) and Celltech Pharmaceuticals: "ADD/ADHD is generally considered a neuro-chemical disorder." "Most people with ADD/ADHD are born with the disorder, though it may not be recognized until adulthood." "ADHD is not caused by poor parenting, a difficult family environment, poor teaching or inadequate nutrition." The article reviews research that contradicts the statements and concludes that the statements are not adequately supported by scientific evidence. Â© 2012 Springer Publishing Company.
