There has been a significant increase in the use of psychiatric medication in children over the last few decades, specifically dopamine agonists (stimulants) and dopamine antagonists (antipsychotics) for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Risperidone is not registered for the treatment of ADHD, it is approved for aggressive behaviour in children. Conduct disorder co-exist with ADHD approximately in 35% of children. Where aggression is severe, pervasive and persistent in the child or adolescent with ADHD, it may be justifiable to add in an atypical neuroleptic e.g. risperidone to the stimulant, or monotherapy with risperidone.
