Aims: Childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) frequently persists into adulthood and continues to impair health-related quality of life (HRQL). Thus, it is important to have validated symptom and HRQL measures for assessing treatment outcomes in this population. The purpose of the current analysis was to assess test-retest reliability of two measures designed specifically for adults with ADHD: the Adult ADHD Self-Report Screener (ASRS) and the Adult ADHD Quality of Life Measure (AAQoL). Methods: Data were collected at a US clinic specializing in the treatment of adult ADHD. Patients completed the ASRS (six-item ADHD symptom screening version) and the AAQoL (a 29-item condition-specific HRQL measure) at two visits, two weeks apart. At the second visit, patients also completed a measure of symptom stability so that test-retest reliability could be examined in the stable population. Test-retest reliability was examined through intraclass correlations (ICC) and t-tests comparing scores from the two visits. Results: A total of 74 participants were enrolled (62.2% male; mean age = 38.6 years), and 43 of these participants attended both visits and were stable between visits (65.1% male; mean age = 39.3 years). The ICC assessing the association between Visit 1 and Visit 2 ASRS scores was 0.86, and the ICCs for the AAQoL subscales were 0.88 (Life Productivity), 0.75 (Psychological Health), 0.74 (Life Outlook), 0.78 (Relationships), and 0.86 (total score). The t-tests found no statistically significant differences between Visit 1 and Visit 2 scores for the ASRS or AAQoL. Conclusions: The ASRS and AAQoL demonstrated good test-retest reliability. Findings add to previous results suggesting that these instruments are useful outcome measures for treatments of ADHD in adults. Â© 2011 SAGE Publications.
