Once considered exclusively a childhood disorder, there is now much evidence that the majority of children with ADHD will become adolescents with ADHD. While childhood symptoms (especially hyperactivity) decline as a function of age, functional impairments increase in adolescence. Academic, social, and family domains are the three most impaired domains of functioning. Oppositional defiant disorder, mood disorder, and substance use disorders are common psychiatric comorbidities in adolescent ADHD. Treatments for adolescent ADHD include medication and psychosocial interventions. Relative to childhood ADHD, far less is known about ADHD in adolescence. Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
