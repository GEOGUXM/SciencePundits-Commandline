This paper describes an eye-controlled game designed for behavioral therapy of ADHD. A user-centered design approach was adopted in the development cycle of these games in close collaboration with domain experts and target user populations. The games have an Arabic language interface and include multimodal interaction. Game scenarios were designed with increasing complexity depicted in visual design, dwell time for controlling elements within the games, and combinations of key presses with eye-control at higher levels of attention training. The visual design, interaction design and the system's conceptual designs are discussed. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.
