The aim of the study was to experimentally examine the reactivity of mood and impulsivity to negative mood induction in adolescents with loss of control (LOC) eating and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. The study included eighty-eight adolescents with LOC eating, ADHD symptoms, and control. Participants self-reported on mood and participated in a stop signal task before and after negative mood induction with Cyberball. Groups did not differ in impulsivity at baseline (p >.05). The LOC group presented with greater increase of negative mood than the ADHD group, and with greater increase of impulsivity than both other groups from pre- to post-Cyberball (p <.05). Stronger reactivity of negative mood and impulsivity in LOC eating corroborates findings in adults that the concepts' association might be specific to binge eating disorder. Additionally, findings add to previous results showing emotion regulation deficits in LOC eating. Future research should examine the concepts' impact on actual eating behavior including binge eating.
