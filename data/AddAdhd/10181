In previous studies, children with both Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and a Reading Disorder were found to have more difficulties with processing speed, working memory, and timed as opposed to non-timed executive functioning (EF) measures when compared with those with either disorder alone. The current study found that older adolescents and adults with both disorders also had more difficulties on processing speed and working memory measures than individuals who only had ADHD. There were no differences among non-timed EF scores. These results add support to the premise that common underlying features may be contributing to the high co-morbidity between these disorders and associated cognitive weaknesses. Â© The Author 2011.
