Aim: Aim of the present study was to evaluate risk factors and prevalence of this disorder in populace at risk and to attest current screening tests sensitivity. Methods: We administered Brown ADD Scales to two samples at risk for attention deficithyperactivity disorder (ADHD): one of acute psychiatric inpatients (N.=56) and the other of affected children' parents (N.=28). We got through to people positive to screening in order to confirm the diagnosis. Results: Data obtained seem to suggest a low reliability of Brown ADD Scales self-scoring in populace at risk. Conclusion: The results obtained indicate the call for developing more sensitive diagnostic instruments targeted on "particular" populaces. It is confirmed the importance of self history and family/close friends records. Generally speaking, it is also confirmed adult ADHD diagnosis as problematic and the need of further and wider researchers.
