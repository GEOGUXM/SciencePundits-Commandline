ADD/ADHD is a chronic, debilitating disorder that can cause patients to be forgetful and disorganized due to the lack of attention. It can be especially disruptive if the patient were a child. Although the exact regimen prescribed is adjusted on a case-to-case basis, the most effective treatment often involves a combination of medicines and behavioral therapies. Medbuddy is a mobile medication management system designed to improve young patients' compliance to the prescription instructions, while attempting to affect positive changes in their behaviors by establishing structured and consistent daily routines and providing both positive and negative feedbacks. By providing timely reminders when it's time to take medications, establishing a reward schedule to reinforce positive behaviors, and interacting with child patients with a configurable avatar, Medbuddy is designed to be an agent of fun that combines medicinal and behavioral treatments to make ADD/ADHD child patients better so they may develop their full potentials.
