Dopamine (DA), as one of catecholamine family of neurotransmitters, is crucially important in humans owing to various critical effects on biometric system such as brine circuitry, neuronal plasticity, organization of stress responses, and control of cardiovascular and renal organizations. Abnormal level of dopamine in the central nervous system causes several neurological diseases, e.g., schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and attention deficit hybperactivity disorder (ADHD)/attention deficit disorder (ADD). In this report, we suggest the fabrication of nonenzyme field effect transistor (FET) sensor composed of immobilized Pt particle decorated conducting-polymer (3-carboxylate polypyrrole) nanoparticles (Pt_CPPy) to detect dopamine. The hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) are produced by means of facile chemical reduction of pristine CPPyNP-contained Pt precursor (PtCl4) solution. The Pt_CPPys are then immobilized on an amine-functionalized (-NH2) interdigitated-array electrode substrate, through the formation of covalent bonds with amine groups (-CONH). The resulting Pt_CPPy-based FET sensors exhibit high sensitivity and selectivity toward DA at unprecedentedly low concentrations (100 × 10-15m) and among interfering biomolecules, respectively. Additionally, due to the covalent bonding involved in the immobilization process, a longer lifetime is expected for the FET sensor. A Pt particle-decorated, 3-carboxylate polypyrrole nanoparticle-based nonenzymatic FET sensor is fabricated for highly sensitive and selective dopamine detection with a long lifetime. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
