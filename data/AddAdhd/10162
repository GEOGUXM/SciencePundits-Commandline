Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) stem from prenatal exposure of the fetus to alcohol. Resulting problems vary on a continuum of severity but commonly involve structural and functional brain abnormalities resulting in problems with academic performance, ADD/ADHD, information processing, math performance, memory, social skills, and increased rates of psychopathology, all of which generally persist into adulthood. This article presents the first uncontrolled case report of neurofeedback treatment of an FASD case on the milder end of this spectrum, which resulted in significant behavioral and academic improvements that were sustained on follow-up at 42 months. It is possible that neurofeedback may hold potential to improve functioning in persons with FASD. Â© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.
