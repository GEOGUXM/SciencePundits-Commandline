Objective: To assess three of the better known screeners for Attention Deficit/Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) and review the relationship between ADHD and cognitive ability. Method: The three ADHD screeners were administered to 111 college students enrolled in a college Introductory Psychology class, on whom ACT scores and total course performance were also available. As a measure of cognitive ability, the Wonderlic Personnel Test (Wonderlic, Inc., 2000) was also administered. Furthermore, self-report data were available from participants who had been diagnosed with ADHD. The three screeners were the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) (Kessler et al., 2005), the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale-Self-Report: Long Version (CAARS) (Conners, Erhardt, & Sparrow, 1999), and the Brown ADD Scales (Brown, 1996). Results: The results are discussed in terms of the scales' reliability, as well as their relationship to academic aptitude, class performance, and their ability to identify self-reported ADHD diagnoses. Conclusion: All three screeners exhibited acceptable reliability levels. Criterion validity was demonstrated by the relationship between the CAARS's inattention subscale and self-reported cases of ADHD. Criterion validity was also seen in the relationship found between the CAARS's hyperactivity/restlessness subscale and the total course performance even after controlling for cognitive ability. Contrary to past research cognitive ability exhibited a weak but significant relationship with a few screeners and screener subscales. Â© 2012 SAGE Publications.
