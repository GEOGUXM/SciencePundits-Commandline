Objective: We aimed to demonstrate the existence and intensity of Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity (A-ADHD symptoms) in cannabis dependent individiuals compare them with healthy controls and discuss the importance of comorbidity of A-ADHD. Methods: Seventy patients participated with informed consent. The participants were selected from patients who underwent inpatient treatment in the Department for Addiction at Samsun Neuropsychiatry Hospital. Diagnostic interviews were conducted for cannabis dependence syndrome (ICD 10; DSM-IV); the earliest interview was after 21 days of detoxification therapy. For assesment, the Adult ADD/ADHD DSM IV based Diagnostic Screening and Rating Scale developed by Prof. Dr. Turgay, former Director of the Toronto ADHD Clinic, Ontario, Canada was used. Mean ADHD total and subscale scores were compared by using the group variable independent t test. The analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows 16.00. Results:. Considerably higher scores were observed in cannabis dependent individuals. Twentyfour patients were re-evaluated and interviewed and Adult ADHD was diagnosed. All three subdimensions of the Turgay Adult ADHD Scale were found to be statistically higher in the cannabis dependent patients. Conclusions: As this study shows, Adult ADHD is highly represented in cannabis dependent patients.(in our sample 35% of patients were diagnosed with Adult ADHD). This study underline importance of the ADHD diagnosis in Turkey.
