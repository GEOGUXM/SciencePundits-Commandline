Caffeine, a psychoactive drug, a methylxanthine alkaloid and polar compound was extracted from tea leaves by organic solvent method. After this, solid impurities were removed by Gravity Filtration while the solvent (DCM) was removed by Steam Distillation at 200°c. the crude caffeine was obtained and it has to be confirmed with two chemical tests as Murexide Identification Test - murexoin purple colour formation; caffeine salicylate formation &amp; collection by vacuum filtration - melting point, 137°c was checked via Mel - Temp apparatus. After confirmatory test, the crude caffeine has to be purified by vacuum sublimation at 190°c where the caffeine sublimes at 178°c and melts at 238°c which was checked by, Mel - Temp apparatus. To assess the purity of caffeine, crude caffeine, sublimed caffeine and standard caffeine samples were subjected to TLC analysis and it was determined by calculating their R f, values and comparing them with standard R f, value range of caffeine, 0.3 - 0.7. the quantification of extracted caffeine was estimated by, UV - Vis spectrophotometric method at 274 nm, by calibrating a graphical representation of the O.D values recorded. We conclude that, many ADD/ADHD people function well enough using caffeine to make it through life. They can easily afford the cost of caffeine and avoid paying for expensive ADD/ADHD prescription drugs. Also, their use of caffeine does not have to be supervised by a health professional. Importantly, for some, ADD/ADHD caffeine users do not have to carry the burden of the diagnosis of having a mental disorder.
