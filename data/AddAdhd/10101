Attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity (ADHD/ADD) is a common disorder characterised by varying degrees of abnormal attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. A deficit of attention during the day is observed in children with ADHD/ADD and is commonly associated with poor sleep during the night. Motor disturbances that occur during the night are often associated with increased sleep fragmentation; the association between restless legs syndrome, periodic movements of the inferior limbs and ADHD/ADD is well documented. Abnormal rhythmic movement and parasomnia, associated with non-rapid eye movement sleep, are also common in children with ADHD/ADD. The assessment of ADHD/ADD in children should include systematic evaluation of these motor sleep disturbances in order to provide optimal treatment.
