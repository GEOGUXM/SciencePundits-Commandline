Inhibition is a fundamental property of behaviour required for flexible responding and humans have evolved executive brain systems that can engage inhibitory processes in order to reduce interference from irrelevant distracting stimuli, block unwanted memories and emotions and suppress inappropriate choices and actions. Without the efficient operation of these inhibitory mechanisms behaviour can become maladaptive, as seen in a large range of disorders where subjects exhibit impulsive responding, such as ADHD, mania, chronic substance abuse and schizophrenia. Animal models are making an increasing contribution to our understanding of the psychology and underlying neurobiology of behavioural inhibition and impulsivity. Here, in this short article we summarise work conducted with rat models, and also discuss recent progress in exploiting the potential of genetically engineered mice. The data so far emphasise the relatively high translational relevance of animal models in this area of behavioural neuroscience. The findings add weight to the existence of dissociable components of impulsive behaviour, they inform the human literature, and may be of significant use in the development of drug therapies to treat the many disorders where failures in behavioural inhibition are prominent.
