Background: Although most of the ADHD (Attention Defcit Hyperactivity Disorder) patients respond to stimulant drugs very well, alternative drugs are required for non respondents. It has been revealed that subgroups of patients with ADHD have omega-3 fatty acid defciency. So, the present study was planned to illustrate the efect of omega-3 supplementation, as an add-on to methylphenidate, on ADHD patients. Materials and Methods: In this double-blind RCT, ADHD children without any co morbidity, who had been diagnosed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist in child and adolescent university clinic, participated and were randomly divided into 2 groups. Te experimental group methylphenidate plus omega-3 capsule (2000mg/d), while control group took methylphenidate plus placebo. Severity of ADHD symptoms were assessed by ADHD rating scale at the baseline and after 2, 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Results: 69 patients (experimental = 36, control = 33) aged 7 to 15 participated. A signifcant reduction of both parent's and teacher's ADHD rating scale scores in both groups was observed. Bu t it couldn't show any diference between two groups. Diference score of parent's at baseline was 1.86+- (5/40), Pv 0.262, after 2 weeks -.70+- (4/30), Pv 0.668,4 weeks. 19+- (5/60), Pv 0.902 and 8 weeks. 30+- (4/42), Pv 0.845. Diference score of Teacher's at baseline was -1.56+- (3/45), Pv 0.541, after 2 weeks -.46+- (6/24), Pv 0.888, 4 weeks. 45+- (5/41), 0.868 and 8 weeks. 73+- (4/18), Pv 0.748. Conclusion: Omega-3 did not enhance the therapeutic results of methylphenidate in ADHD patients.
