Abnormal hexanucleotide repeat expansion of C9ORF72 is known to cause neurodegenerative disorders such as frontotemporal dementia. Additionally, patients with psychotic symptoms are more likely to have abnormal hexanucleotide repeat expansion than are patients without them. We investigated the hexanucleotide repeat sizes of C9ORF72 in 466 Japanese schizophrenia patients. We found no abnormal hexanucleotide repeat expansion. In conclusion, C9ORF72 may not be responsible for schizophrenia susceptibility in the Japanese population. Â© 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.
