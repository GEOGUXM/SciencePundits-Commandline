Schizophrenia has been recently increasingly linked with a number of structural brain morphological changes which can be associated with functional deficiencies. The aim of this study is to relate electrophysiological changes with structural changes of Heschl's gyrus (HG) volume in schizophrenia. Fifteen schizophrenia patients were compared with control group by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetry and auditory evoked potentials. A significantly lower bilateral HG volumes and a significantly lower global field power value of the N1P2 component were detected in the schizophrenia group. The auditory evoked potentials have been used as a functional correlate that displayed a significant amplitude reduction that matched the reduction in the HG volume with the chronicity of the disease. This trend may be utilized as a vehicle to assess follow-up of the disorder by means of MRI and electrophysiology. Â© 2015.
