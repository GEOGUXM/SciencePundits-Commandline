Background: Hormonal deregulation is associated with suicidal risk in various psychiatric disorders. Thyroid hormones and prolactin play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The present study aimed to analyze thyroid hormones and prolactin levels in patients with schizophrenia, and to explore its association with disease severity and suicide risk. Methods: Thirty-eight cases and 38 controls were included in the study. Serum thyroid hormones and prolactin were estimated in all the subjects. Disease severity was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and suicidal ideations were assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Results: Serum prolactin (p. =. 0.004) and free T4 (p. =. 0.029) were significantly elevated in the schizophrenia group as compared to controls. Serum prolactin was significantly associated with higher negative symptom scores (r. =. 0.418, p. =. 0.008), but not positive symptoms or general psychopathology of schizophrenia. Thyroid hormones were not associated with disease severity scores. Suicidal ideas were more common in schizophrenia patients with higher free T4 (p. =. 0.011). Conclusion: Prolactin and free T4 were increased in patients with schizophrenia as compared to controls. Suicidal ideation was associated with increased free T4, but not prolactin levels.
