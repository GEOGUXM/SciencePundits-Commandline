In an attempt to better understand the molecular mechanism of action of the antipsychotic lead LASSBio-579 and of its main metabolite LQFM 037, the aim of this work was to evaluate their intrinsic activity and binding kinetics at the dopamine D<inf>2</inf> receptor. In transfected HEK cells expressing the D<inf>2L</inf> receptor under an inducible promoter, LASSBio-579 and LQFM 037, but not clozapine, behaved as weak partial agonists in [35S]-GTPγS binding assays performed in optimized conditions previously shown to evidence the partial agonist profile of aripiprazole. Besides, data obtained in radioligand competition assays on rat striatal membranes suggested a rapid association to and dissociation from the D<inf>2</inf>-like receptors. Using the kinetic rate index based on the strategy of the dual-point competition association assay, we showed that our compounds share a similar kinetic profile with clozapine, distinct from the typical antipsychotic haloperidol. These two characteristics could contribute to the atypical-like profile observed after administration of LASSBio-579 to rodents, in models of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.
