Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been applied to examine the possible functional alternations during the performance of cognitive tasks in schizophrenia. With this technique, previous studies have observed that patients with schizophrenia are often associated with reduced brain activation in the prefrontal cortex during the verbal fluency task (VFT) of the English version or the Japanese version. However, it remains unclear whether there is a brain functional impairment in Chinese-speaking patients with schizophrenia. In this study, we designed a Chinese version of the VFT and performed a multichannel NIRS study in a large group of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We investigated brain activation during the task period of the Chinese version of the VFT within a schizophrenia group and a healthy group, respectively, and compared the relative changes between the two groups. Our results confirmed that Chinese-speaking patients with schizophrenia had significantly lower brain activation in the prefrontal cortex and superior temporal cortex when compared with healthy controls. Such findings based on the NIRS data provided us reliable evidences about brain functional deficits in the Chinese-speaking patients with schizophrenia. Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.
