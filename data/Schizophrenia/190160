Introduction: Several studies have shown that changes in the bioappearance of a pharmaceutical drug can alter adherence. Hypothesis: This study hypothesis is that the prescription of olanzapine in capsules is associated with a higher adherence than pills because the pharmacist cannot substitute the prescription for the same active pharmaceutical ingredient with a different bioappearance. Material and methods: The study included 1017 antipsychotic-treated patients with a 6 month follow-up. Adherence to olanzapine in pills (liable to change by pharmacist) was compared to olanzapine in capsules (not liable to change). Results: A significant increase in general adherence was noted throughout the study (48.6% adherence at baseline and 64.8% in the 6 month visit). When only the subgroup of patients with olanzapine was analyzed, no differences in adherence were noted between the capsule and pill presentations at baseline. However, higher adherence was observed during follow-up in those patients with olanzapine capsules. Conclusion: The pharmaceutical presentation of olanzapine in capsules is associated with a higher adherence. © 2015 Elsevier España, S.L.U. y Sociedad Española de Psiquiatría y Sociedad Española de Psiquiatría Biológica.
