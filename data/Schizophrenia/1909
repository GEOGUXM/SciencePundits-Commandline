Sensory gating is the ability to filter out irrelevant stimuli from the environment. Individuals with schizophrenia consistently demonstrate deficits in this ability leading to sensory overload and cognitive fragmentation. This dysfunction has also been found in schizotypy, which is defined as a manifestation of nonclinical symptoms qualitatively similar to those found in schizophrenia. In the present study, auditory sensory gating was assessed in healthy individuals by testing the attenuation of the P50 event-related potential. The degree of suppression was then correlated with schizotypy by using the O-LIFE questionnaire. Relative to the low-scoring individuals, P50 suppression was significantly reduced in those with high levels of schizotypy. Furthermore, the degree of deficit in P50 gating correlated with both cognitive disorganisation and impulsive nonconformity dimensions of schizotypy. These results suggest that schizotypal individuals may have early sensory gating deficits similar to schizophrenia patients, especially if they display a disorganised or impulsive profile. As they do not exhibit overt psychotic symptoms, it is likely that such deficits represent an underlying core cognitive dysfunction within the schizophrenia spectrum. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
