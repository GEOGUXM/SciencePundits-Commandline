Non-toxic postmortem trazodone tissue (liver) concentrations have not been previously described. Liver trazodone concentrations were compared to peripheral blood and central blood concentrations in 19 medical examiner cases. Postmortem blood specimens were initially screened for alcohol and simple volatiles, drugs of abuse, and alkaline drugs. Trazodone, when detected by the alkaline drug screen, was subsequently confirmed and quantified by a high performance liquid chromatography procedure. Re-analyses showed that there may be degradation of trazodone in postmortem blood stored at 4 °C There was, on average, about a 20% decrease in samples stored up to eight months. These data suggest that postmortem trazodone peripheral blood concentrations may be considered non-toxic to at least 1.0 mg/L with liver concentrations to at least 2.2 mg/kg. Overall, trazodone concentrations ranged from 0.08-6.1 mg/L in peripheral blood, 0.07-7.1 mg/L in central blood, and 039-26 mg/kg in liver. The median trazodone central blood to peripheral blood ratio was 0.98 (N = 19) The liver to peripheral blood ratios showed a median value of 2.8 L/kg (N = 18). Given that a liver to peripheral blood ratio less than 5 L/kg is consistent with little to no propensity for postmortem redistribution, these data demonstrate that trazodone is unlikely to show significant redistribution. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
