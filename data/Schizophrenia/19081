Several recurrent copy number variants (CNVs) increasing risk to neuropsychiatric diseases have been identified in recent years. They show variable clinical expressivity, being associated with different disorders, and incomplete penetrance. However, due to its very low frequency, the full variety of clinical outcomes associated with each one of these CNVs is unknown. Current methods for detection of CNVs are labor intensive, expensive or not suitable for high throughput analysis. Quantitative interspecies competitive PCR linked to variant minisequencing and detection by mass-spectrometry may overcome these limitations. Here, we present two multiplex assays based on this method to screen for eleven psychiatric risk CNVs, such as 1q21, 16p11.2, 3q29, or 16p13.11 regions, among others. The assays were tested in our collection of 514 schizophrenia patients. Results were compared with MLPA at two CNVs. Additional positive results were confirmed by exome sequencing. A total of fourteen patients were CNV carriers. The method presents high sensitivity and specificity, showing its utility as a cheap, accurate, high throughput screening tool for recurrent CNVs. The method may be very useful for management of psychiatric patients as well as screening of different collections of samples to better identify the full spectrum of clinical variability.
