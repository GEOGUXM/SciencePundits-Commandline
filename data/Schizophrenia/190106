A novel series of arylpiperazinylalkyl purine-2,4-diones (4-27) and purine-2,4,8-triones (31-38) was synthesized and tested to evaluated their affinity for the serotoninergic (5-HT1A, 5-HT6, 5-HT7) and dopaminergic (D2) receptors. Compounds with purine-2,4-dione nucleus generally had affinity values higher than the corresponding purine-2,4,8-trione compounds. A spectrum of receptor activities was observed for compounds with a substituent at the 7-position of the imidazo[2,1-f]purine-2,4-dione system and some potent 5-HT1A (18, 25), 5-HT7 (14) and mixed 5-HT1A/5-HT7 (8, 9) receptor ligands with additional affinity for dopamine D2 receptors (15) has been identified. Moreover, docking studies proved that a substituent at the 7-position of 1,3-dimethyl-(1H,8H)-imidazo[2,1-f]purine-2,4-dione could be essential for receptor affinity and selectivity, especially towards 5-HT1A and 5-HT7. The results of the preliminary pharmacological in vivo studies of selected derivatives of 1,3-dimethyl-(1H,8H)-imidazo[2,1-f]purine-2,4-dione, including 9 as a potential anxiolytic, 8 and 15 as potential antidepressants, and 18 and 25 as potential antidepressant and anxiolytic agents.
