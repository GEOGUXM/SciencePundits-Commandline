The spatial organization of oligodendrocytes and pyramidal neurons in the anterior limbic cortex in health and schizophrenia was studied using automated two-dimensional image analysis. Layer III of this area of the cortex in schizophrenia showed a 20% reduction in the minimal distance between oligodendrocytes and their nearest neurons and 10% and 9% reductions, respectively, in the mean maximum distance between neurons and their nearest oligodendrocytes. Thus, this automatic image analysis method allows assessment of the spatial organization of neurons and glial cells in the cerebral cortex not only in health, but also in mental pathology.
