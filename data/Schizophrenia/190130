The startle reflex to an intense acoustic pulse stimulus is attenuated if the pulse stimulus is shortly preceded by a weak non-startling prepulse stimulus. This attenuation of the startle reflex represents a form of pre-attentional sensory gating known as prepulse inhibition (PPI). Although PPI does not require learning, its expression is regulated by higher cognitive processes. PPI deficits have been detected in several psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia where they co-exist with cognitive deficits. A potential link between PPI expression and cognitive performance has therefore been suggested such that poor PPI may predict, or may be mechanistically linked to, overt cognitive impairments. A positive relationship between PPI and strategy formation, planning efficiency, and execution speed has been observed in healthy humans. However, parallel studies in healthy animals are rare. It thus remains unclear what cognitive domains may be associated with, or orthogonal to, sensory gating in the form of PPI in healthy animals. The present study evaluated a potential link between the magnitude of PPI and spatial memory performance by comparing two subgroups of animals differing substantially in baseline PPI expression (low-PPI vs high-PPI) within a homogenous cohort of 100 male adult C57BL/6 mice. Assessment of spatial reference memory in the Morris water maze and spatial recognition memory in the Y-maze failed to reveal any difference between low-PPI and high-PPI subjects. These negative findings contrast with our previous reports that individual difference in PPI correlated with sustained attention and working memory performance in C57BL/6 mice.
