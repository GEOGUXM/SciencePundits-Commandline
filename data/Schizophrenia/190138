In most societies it is still perceived as a stigma to suffer from mental disorders. Individuals with mental problems suffer from widespread disapproval and rejection of mental illnesses. In most cases people with mental disorders are socially excluded, discriminated and social participation in society is impeded. There exist different forms of stigmatization. Public stigmatization (public stigma) describes the negative attitudes that exist in the general population whereas self-stigma describes the internalization and acceptance of these negative attitudes in people with mental illnesses. Both forms contribute to negative outcomes such that people avoid communicating openly about their illness and seeking help from mental health professionals. Therefore, education and actions are needed on a societal and professional level to combat the stigmatization of mental disorders. Â© 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg
