Introduction: We examined physical violence in a large, multihospital state psychiatric system during 2011–2013, and associated demographic and clinical characteristics of violent patients to better understand issues of patient and staff safety. Method: Acts of physical violence committed by patients against other patients (n=10,958) or against staff (n=8429) during 2011–2013 were collected and analyzed for all hospitalized patients during the same time period to derive prevalence rates and associated odds ratios. Results: Overall, 31.4% of patients committed at least 1 violent assault during their hospitalization. Differential risk factor patterns were noted across patient and staff assault. Younger age was associated with a higher prevalence of both patient and staff assault, as was nonforensic legal status. Females had a higher prevalence of staff assault than patient assault. Ethnic groups varied on rates of patient assault, but had no significant differences for staff assault. Schizoaffective disorder was associated with higher prevalence and odds of patient (OR 1.244, 95% CI 1.131 to 1.370) and staff (OR 1.346, 95% CI 1.202 to 1.507) assault when compared to patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Most personality disorder diagnoses also had a higher prevalence and odds of physical violence. One percent of patients accounted for 28.7% of all assaults. Additionally, violent patients had a significantly longer length of hospitalization. Discussion: Implications of these findings to enhance patient safety and inform future violence reduction efforts, including the need for new treatments in conjunction with the use of violence risk assessments, are discussed. © Cambridge University Press 2015
