Background: The auditory P3 event-related potential (ERP) is thought to index cognitive processing relevant to attention and working memory processes. Drug challenge studies suggest that glutamate neurotransmission plays an important role in modulating P3 ERP. However, while direct links between glutamate activity and P3 ERP response in humans are suspected, mechanistic details remain largely unknown. We investigated here the relationships between P3 ERP and indices of glutamatergic processing measured in vivo with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS). We hypothesized that a higher index of glutamatergic processing (glutamine/glutamate ratio; abbreviated Gln/Glu) in the anterior cingulate (ACC) and in the parietal-occipital (POC) cortices would associate with larger frontal P3a and parietal P3b amplitudes, respectively. Methods: Frontal P3a (Fz) and parietal P3b (Pz) were collected from 32 healthy participants who performed an auditory oddball task. Resting glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), and Gln/Glu (an index of glutamatergic processing) measures were obtained on a 4. T MR scanner using J-resolved MR spectroscopy. Linear regression and partial correlations were used for statistical analysis. Results: Significant positive correlations were found between frontal P3a amplitude and ACC Gln/Glu ratio (partial R= 0.57; P= 0.001) and between frontal P3a amplitude and ACC Gln concentration (partial R= 0.43; P= 0.02). Relationships between parietal P3b and the glutamate indices in the POC were not significant. Conclusions: These results indicate a specific connection between an index of glutamate neurotransmitter function in ACC and frontal P3 ERP, providing a novel insight into the neurochemistry underlying scalp recorded EEG response. Abnormalities in glutamate neurotransmission have been observed in schizophrenia and other psychiatric conditions and may underlie illness related deficits of P3 ERP. Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.
