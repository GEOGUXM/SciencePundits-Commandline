Objective: To compare the prevalence of Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) among schizophrenia patients with that of the general population in a south Indian rural community. Methods: Alcohol use pattern of 254 schizophrenia patients in the past year was compared with randomly selected healthy comparison subjects (n. = 350) from the same community in an administrative block of rural India using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Results: A significantly smaller proportion of patients used alcohol in the past year (10.2%; 95% CI: 6.5%-14.0%) than controls (18.3%; 95% CI: 15.8%-24.1%; OR. = 2.2; 95% CI. = 1.4-3.5). This was true for AUD (hazardous use and harmful use; total AUDIT score >. 8) also: 5.5% patients (95% CI: 2.7%-8.3%) and 10.3% controls (95% CI: 7.1%-13.4%) had hazardous use (OR. = 2.0; 95% CI. = 1.0-3.7). Hazardous use was associated with domicile in villages and lesser years of education. On logistic regression, after controlling for these confounds, the odds of having AUD were 2.7 times more for controls than for patients (95% CI. = 1.4-5.2). Conclusions: Prevalence of AUD is significantly lower in patients than in the general population in this community. Cross-cultural studies are needed to elucidate factors that underlie contrasting results across different countries. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
