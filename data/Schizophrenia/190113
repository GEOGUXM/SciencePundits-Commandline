Rationale: Paired associates learning (PAL) has been suggested to be predictive of functional outcomes in first episode psychosis and of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. An automated touch screen-based rodent PAL (rPAL) task has been developed and is sensitive to manipulations of the dopaminergic and glutamatergic system. Accordingly, rPAL when used with pharmacological models of schizophrenia, like NMDA receptor blockade with MK-801 or dopaminergic stimulation with amphetamine, may have utility as a translational model of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine if amphetamine- and MK-801-induced impairment represent distinct models of cognitive impairment by testing their sensitivity to common antipsychotics and determine the relative contributions of D1 versus D2 receptors on performance of PAL. Method: Rats were trained in rPAL and were then treated with MK-801, amphetamine, risperidone, haloperidol, quinpirole, SK-82958, or SCH-23390 alone and in combination. Results: While both amphetamine and MK-801 caused clear impairments in accuracy, MK-801 induced a profound “perseverative” type behavior that was more pronounced when compared to amphetamine. Moreover, amphetamine-induced impairments, but not the effects of MK-801, could be reversed by antipsychotics as well as the D1 receptor antagonist SCH-23390, suggesting a role for both the D1 and D2 receptor in the amphetamine impairment model. Conclusions: These data suggest that amphetamine and MK-801 represent dissociable models of impairment in PAL, dependent on different underlying neurobiology. The ability to distinguish dopaminergic versus glutamatergic effects on performance in rPAL makes it a unique and useful tool in the modeling of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg
