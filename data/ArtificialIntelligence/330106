This paper proposes new definitions of lower and upper multiset approximations, which are basic concepts of the rough multiset theory. These definitions come naturally from the concepts of multiset topology and the concepts of ambiguity introduced in this paper. The new definitions are compared to the classical definitions and are shown to be more general. In the sense that they are the only ones which can be used for any type of indiscernibility or similarity multiset relation. Â© 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
