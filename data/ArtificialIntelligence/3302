The International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) is the flagship conference of the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society. This year, for ISSCC, the theme is ?Silicon Systems: Small Chips for Big Data.? Big data is enveloping us: it is being generated by the Internet-of-Things (IoT), health care, and the Web, changing our society and our individual lives. Small silicon chips enable these changes through data sensing, gathering, processing, storing, and networking through wireless and wireline connectivity. Recent silicon-?system technologies, including ultra-low-power systems, high-performance circuits and systems, wireless power and data transmission, and three-dimensional (3-D) IC structures, will open the door to big data applications. Moreover, big data applications such as health care, machine learning, and sensor systems will challenge designers to consider new system architectures requiring advances in circuits and technology. ISSCC 2015 showcases novel circuit and system solutions that open new vistas for society, providing opportunities for new lifestyle transformations, all driven by big data technology. Â© 2015 IEEE.
