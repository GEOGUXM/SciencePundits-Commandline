Location estimation methods using radio fingerprint have been studied extensively. The approach constructs a database that associates ambient radio signals with physical locations in training phase, and then estimates the location by finding the most similar signal pattern within the database. To achieve robust and accurate location estimation, the training phase should be conducted across the entire target space. In practice, however, a user may only access limited or authorized places in a building, that causes degradation in accuracy. In this paper, we present a smartphone-based autonomous indoor war-walking scheme, which automatically constructs the location fingerprint database, even covering unvisited locations. While a smartphone user explores the target area, the proposed system tracks the user's trajectory and simultaneously trains the location fingerprint database. Furthermore, our scheme interpolates radio signals in the database with an appropriate radio propagation model, and supplements fingerprints for unvisited places. As a result, although a user may sparsely explore the target site, the scheme returns the complete database. We implemented our solution and demonstrated the feasibility of the solution. Â© 2014 IEEE.
