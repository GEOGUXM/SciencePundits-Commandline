Abstract This paper presents a heuristic approach to Active Demand Side Management in the Off-Grid systems with a set of specific requirements. The tests were performed on the smart house platform developed at VSB - Technical University of Ostrava campus, Czech Republic in order to accomplish the effective design, testing, operation and analysis of the proposed system. These results consequently consist of a prerequisite for the development of new leading-edge power distribution systems in the Off-Grid environment and for improvement of the efficiency, security and reliability of the existing systems.
