The maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) has received increasing attention in signal processing and machine learning due to its robustness against outliers (or impulsive noises). Some gradient based adaptive filtering algorithms under MCC have been developed and available for practical use. The fixed-point algorithms under MCC are, however, seldom studied. In particular, too little attention has been paid to the convergence issue of the fixed-point MCC algorithms. In this letter, we will study this problem and give a sufficient condition to guarantee the convergence of a fixed-point MCC algorithm. Â© 2015 IEEE.
