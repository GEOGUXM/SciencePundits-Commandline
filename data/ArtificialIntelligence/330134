What is the identity property? It is usually taken for granted that the identity of an object, including self-awareness, is constant over time and that identity properties are immutable. However, there are some difficulties in this type of definition, because a property that defines itself leads to a kind of circular argument. In this study, we address this self-referential problem by category theory. In category theory, the identity arrow can be decomposed into a monomorphism and an epimorphism, which are called a section and a retraction, respectively. We consider the level of difference between the arrow and its elements as being retractions. By taking account of interaction between these different levels, we show that dynamical properties emerge through the identity function. Finally, we also discuss that defining identity systems shows a power-law behavior. Â© 2015 ISAROB
