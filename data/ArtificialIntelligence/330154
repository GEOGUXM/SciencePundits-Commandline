This paper deals with finite-time consensus problems for multiagent systems that are subject to hybrid cooperative and antagonistic interactions. Two consensus protocols are constructed by employing the nearest neighbor rule. It is shown that under the presented protocols, the states of all agents can be guaranteed to reach an agreement in a finite time regarding consensus values that are the same in modulus but may not be the same in sign. In particular, the second protocol can enable all agents to reach a finite-time consensus with a settling time that is not dependent upon the initial states of agents. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and finite-time convergence of the proposed consensus protocols.
