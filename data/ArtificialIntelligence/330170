Smart lighting systems go far beyond merely replacing lamps. These modern systems are now able to reproduce arbitrary spectra, color temperatures, and intensities and pivot on smart sensors and actuators incorporating information and communication technologies. This paper presents an interoperable smart lighting solution that combines heterogeneous lighting technologies enabling intelligent functions. The system can shift light intensity to increase visual comfort, and it is oriented toward human centric lighting studies. Moreover, this system follows the guidelines defined by the ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451 standards and ZigBee Light Link and also, it includes an additional transducer signal treatment service for artificial intelligence algorithms. Finally, a representational state transfer application allows us to test the interoperability and visualize energy savings in an office room. Â© 2015 IEEE.
