Extreme learning machine (ELM) is one of the most important and efficient machine learning algorithms for pattern classification due to its fast learning speed. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble based ELM approach for cross-modality face matching. Different to traditional face recognition methods, the proposed approach integrates the voting-base extreme learning machine (V-ELM) with a novel feature learning based face descriptor. Firstly, the discriminant feature learning is proposed to learn the cross-modality feature representation. Then, we used common subspace learning based method to reduce the obtained cross-modality features. Finally, Voting ELM is utilized as the classifier to improve the recognition accuracy and to speed up the feature learning process. Experiments conducted on two different heterogeneous face recognition scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Â© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
