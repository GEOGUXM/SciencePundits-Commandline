I consider the questions: what is an intelligent building, and what could make a building ‘intelligent’. The answer to this question turns on the more fundamental question: what is intelligence? I propose that two metaphors for intelligence are informative. On the one hand is intelligence through top-down engineered computation and code, what might be called the executive metaphor for intelligence. On the other is emergent intelligence, in which intelligence emerges as the outcome of an infinitude of negotiations between multitudinous cognitive agents. Emergent intelligence is the logic of the core biological principle of homeostasis: the emergence of persistent and low-entropy disequilibria. Architecture and engineering, in contrast, have long been immersed in the executive metaphor for intelligence. I suggest architects and engineers will be able to build a truly intelligent building when they embody within their constructions the emergent metaphor for intelligence. © 2015 Taylor & Francis
