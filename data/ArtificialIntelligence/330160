Hashing techniques have been widely used in many machine learning applications because of their efficiency in both computation and storage. Although a variety of hashing methods have been proposed, most of them make some implicit assumptions about the statistical or geometrical structure of data. In fact, few hashing algorithms can adequately handle all kinds of data with different structures. When considering hybrid structure datasets, different hashing algorithms might produce different and possibly inconsistent binary codes. Inspired by the successes of classifier combination and clustering ensembles, in this paper, we present a novel combination strategy for multiple hashing results, named consensus hashing. By defining the measure of consensus of two hashing results, we put forward a simple yet effective model to learn consensus hash functions which generate binary codes consistent with the existing ones. Extensive experiments on several large scale benchmarks demonstrate the overall superiority of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art hashing algorithms. Â© 2015 The Author(s)
