Computational intelligence is a branch of artificial intelligence that comprises algorithms inspired by nature. The common characteristics of all these algorithms is their collective intelligence and adaptability to a changing environment. Due to their efficiency and simplicity, these algorithms have been employed for problem solving across social and natural sciences. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that nature-inspired algorithms are also useful within the domain of sport, in particular for obtaining safe and effective training plans targeting various aspects of performance. We outline the benefits and opportunities of applying computational intelligence in sports, and we also comment on the pitfalls and challenges for the future development of this emerging research domain.
