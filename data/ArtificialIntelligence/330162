Currently, research on content based image copy detection mainly focuses on robust feature extraction. However, due to the exponential growth of online images, it is necessary to consider searching among large scale images, which is very time-consuming and unscalable. Hence, we need to pay much attention to the efficiency of image detection. In this paper, we propose a fast feature aggregating method for image copy detection which uses machine learning based hashing to achieve fast feature aggregation. Since the machine learning based hashing effectively preserves neighborhood structure of data, it yields visual words with strong discriminability. Furthermore, the generated binary codes leads image representation building to be of low-complexity, making it efficient and scalable to large scale databases. Experimental results show good performance of our approach. Â© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
