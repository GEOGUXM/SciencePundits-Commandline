Long span bridges have usually experienced natural disaster during service age. A typhoon is very specific natural phenomenon which has a great impact on human life, including civil structures themselves. Combined with IT, operation of these monitoring systems enables reasonable, scientific, and economic maintenance based on measured data. IN particular, as climate has changed due to global warming, unexpected natural disasters have occurred more frequently. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) for the cable supported bridges in a typhoon can reduce maintenance efforts and costs. Scientific verification for cable supported bridge structural performance is also possible using SHM data. This can ensure a more efficient maintenance strategy is developed for bridges. This study analyzed the SHM data of a cable stayed bridge during a typhoon, with the structural capacity evaluated respective to the safety ratio for Fracture Critical Member (FCM). Finally, some strategies for cable supported bridge maintenance during a typhoon were suggested and its applicability was discussed.
