The Florida Public Hurricane Loss Model (FPHLM) is a large scale, multidisciplinary project developed to assist the state of Florida with the regulation of residential insurance premiums as they relate to insured losses caused by hurricane winds. The modeling services provided to clients using the FPHLM involve physically distributed personnel with different levels of technical expertise. Bringing together such a team to collaborate on the complex task of operating the FPHLM requires a centralized system to support the effective allocation of human resources, the tracking of the different stages of the data processing, and the exchange of information among team members and between the modeler and the clients. In this paper we present a web-based collaboration system that automates the FPHLM's insurance data processing workflow. Â© 2014 ICST.
