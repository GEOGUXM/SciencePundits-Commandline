This study compiles the latest regional topographic data from field investigation and remote-sensing images to recalculate parameters of the universal soil loss equation (USLE) model of the Shenmu watershed; also to compensate for reduced accuracy of this model on small-scale slopes, this study incorporates soil erosion pin data which were collected periodically to measure the extent of soil erosion. Firstly, this study utilized the USLE model and soil erosion pin data to compare the soil erosion potential of the Chushui and Aiyuzi subwatersheds and concluded that soil erosion drastically increased if accumulated rainfall exceeded 200 mm; also, erosion depths were greater in the Aiyuzi subwatershed while estimated total erosion volume was higher in the Chushui subwatershed; this was attributed to the larger area of Chushui subwatershed and based on field measurements which supported the results of the USLE model. Secondly, this study utilized modified USLE model to compare the extreme event erosion resulting from typhoon Morakot which revealed that high rainfall intensity and long-duration rainfall events can generate large volume non-point sources of sediment that is estimated to far exceed 7–10 times of the annual soil erosion. Thirdly, this study related the C parameter of the USLE model to the existing land use in the Shenmu watershed using current, real data. Finally, this study established a post-typhoon Morakot soil erosion risk map composed of five categories of risk which was compared with post-event land cover to suggest high-erosion risk zones that may require further monitoring, remediation, and engineering measures to limit soil loss. © 2015 The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering and Springer Japan
