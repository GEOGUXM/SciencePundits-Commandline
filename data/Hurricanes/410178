A three-dimensional (3-D) baroclinic finite-volume ocean model (FVCOM) was developed to examine the oceanic response to Hurricane Igor over the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Hurricane Igor generated a storm surge of almost 1 m at St. John's and about 0.8 m at three nearby coastal tide gauge stations (Bonavista, Argentia and St. Lawrence). The surge magnitude from the 3-D baroclinic model agrees approximately with tide-gauge observations at all four stations, slightly better than that from an alternative 3-D barotropic case. The sudden drop of sea surface temperature caused by the storm, approximately 6°C as observed by buoys, is well simulated by the baroclinic model with a k-ε turbulence closure. A sensitivity simulation with the Mellor-Yamada turbulence closure significantly underestimates sea surface cooling. It is shown that the sea surface cooling is mainly associated with turbulent mixing, and to a lesser degree with Ekman upwelling. The model solution shows that the largest surge occurred between Bonavista and St. John's. Further analysis suggests the generation of a free continental shelf wave after the storm made landfall, with the peak surge propagating from St. John's to St. Lawrence. © 2015.
