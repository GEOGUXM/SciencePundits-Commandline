An effective preventive maintenance program plays a critical role in improving the reliability of electric power systems. In this paper, the impact of potential damage due to hurricane is incorporated in the power system maintenance scheduling problem. The proposed model considers component deterioration, as well as two competing and independent failure modes, i.e., failure due to loss of reliability and failure due to hurricane damages. Furthermore, the interrelationship between the component, the grid, and the associated downtime cost dynamics are incorporated in the problem. The downtime cost of the power system due to component outage is formulated using mixed-integer programming. The obtained downtime cost is used in a stochastic dynamic programming model to derive the optimal maintenance policy for the component. Â© 2014 IEEE.
