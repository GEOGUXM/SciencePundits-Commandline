Tropical and extra-tropical cyclones are episodic events that redistribute sediment, pollutants, nutrients and heat on continental shelves. The development and validation of ocean and sediment transport models is necessary to interpret short-term events on the long-term sediment record. Numerous studies have used pre- and post-storm surveys to validate three-dimensional sediment resuspension and transport models, but due to extreme sampling conditions in situ validation has been limited to a few point measurements. Over the last decade many of the acoustic and optical sensors used on tripods and benthic landers have been developed for, and included on, autonomous underwater vehicles. In this study we use a combination of the Regional Ocean Modeling System and a Teledyne-Webb Slocum glider as well as other regional ocean observing assets to characterize sediment transport on the New Jersey continental shelf during Hurricane Sandy in October of 2012.
