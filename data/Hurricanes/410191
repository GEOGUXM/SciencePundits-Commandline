This study explored the relationships among Hurricane Katrina-related stressors, coping/adjustment, and leisure among Japanese and Japanese American survivors in New Orleans. Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted in March 2012. Continuous uncertainty, along with Katrina-related stressful events, negatively impacted the survivors' psychological well-being. Leisure had four distinct meanings in their coping and adjustment processes, providing (a) a positive distraction, (b) an opportunity to stay optimistic and hopeful, (c) a source of new normalcy at both societal and individual levels, and (d) a context for positive inner changes. Additionally, Japanese unique perspectives and attitudes (e.g., quietness, humbleness, modesty) facilitated certain coping strategies. Overall, this study provided evidence for the role of leisure in meaning-making as a key function of coping and adjustment.
