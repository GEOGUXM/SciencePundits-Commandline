Hurricane Sandy severely impacted the City of New York in October of 2012. The storm and its aftermath provides a window into potential opportunities for enhanced adaptation in a range of urban settings but also reveals much about the urbanization process and cities' capacity to respond to climate change. This paper examines these insights with a focus on those that might be useful for decision-makers and stakeholders in subSaharan African cities. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
