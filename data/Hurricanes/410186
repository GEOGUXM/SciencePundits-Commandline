Medium-range forecasts of Hurricane Sandy's track were characterized by widely diverging solutions, with some suggesting that Sandy would make landfall over the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, while others forecast the storm to move due east to the north of Bermuda. Here, dynamical processes responsible for the eastward-tracking forecasts are diagnosed using an 80-member ensemble of experimental Global Forecast System (GFS) forecasts initialized five days prior to landfall. Comparing the ensemble members with tracks to the east against those with tracks to the west indicates that the eastern members were characterized by a lower-amplitude upper-tropospheric anticyclone on the poleward side of Sandy during the first 24 h of the forecast, which in turn was associated with a westerly perturbation steering wind. The amplification of this ridge in each set of members was modulated by differences in the advection of potential vorticity (PV) by the irrotational wind associated with Sandy's secondary circulation and isentropic lift along a warm front that formed on the poleward side of Sandy. The amplitude of the irrotational wind in this region was proportional to the 0-h water vapor mixing ratio, and to a lesser extent the 0-h upper-tropospheric horizontal divergence. These two quantities modulated the vertical profile of grid-scale condensation within the model and subsequent upper-tropospheric divergence. The results from this study suggest that additional observations within regions of large-scale precipitation outside the tropical cyclone (TC) core could benefit TC track forecasts, particularly when the TC is located near an upper-tropospheric PV gradient.
