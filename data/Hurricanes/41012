The pressure field on the upper and lower surfaces of a photovoltaic (PV) module comprised of 24 individual PV panels was studied experimentally in a wind tunnel for four different wind directions. The results show that the pressure distribution on the module surface is symmetric about its mid-plane for head-on wind (0° and 180°) and asymmetric at other wind directions. The inter-panel gap (which is essential in large PV modules) is found to influence module's surface pressure field. Pressure magnitudes on the module surface were increased with the module inclination angle, as expected. It is also observed that the mean pressure magnitudes on the PV module under smooth wind exposure are higher than those under open terrain wind exposure. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
