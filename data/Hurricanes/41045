Background: School satisfaction is linked to a number of important school outcomes like academic performance and school engagement. Following exposure to disasters, adolescents may undergo mental health challenges that threaten factors critical to school satisfaction, such as positive school climate and supportive school relationships. Objective: The current study examined the mediating role of posttraumatic stress symptoms on the relationship between exposure to a hurricane and school dissatisfaction. Method: Regression analyses were used to test relationships in a large sample of predominately White female high school students who participated in a needs assessment 6 months after Hurricane Katrina. Results: Results revealed a significant, direct association between hurricane exposure and dissatisfaction with school, as well as indirect associations via posttraumatic stress symptoms. Conclusions: These findings underscore the need for research to explicate the relationship between disasters and school satisfaction. Research is also needed to determine whether school-based interventions that have shown success in reducing anxiety symptoms in youth post-disaster also work to minimize disruptions in the school environment and ultimately reduce dissatisfaction with school.
