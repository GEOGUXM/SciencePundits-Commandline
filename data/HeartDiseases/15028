Wnt signaling pathways and microRNAs (miRNAs) are critical regulators of development. Aberrant Wnt signaling pathways and miRNA levels lead to developmental defects and diverse human pathologies including but not limited to cancer. Wnt signaling pathways regulate a plethora of cellular processes during embryonic development and maintain homeostasis of adult tissues. A majority of Wnt signaling components are regulated by miRNAs which are small noncoding RNAs that are expressed in both animals and plants. In animal cells, miRNAs fine tune gene expression by pairing primarily to the 3'untranslated region of protein coding mRNAs to repress target mRNA translation and/or induce target degradation. miRNA-mediated regulation of signaling transduction pathways is important in modulating dose-sensitive response of cells to signaling molecules. This review discusses components of the Wnt signaling pathways that are regulated by miRNAs in the context of development and diseases. A fundamental understanding of miRNA functions in Wnt signaling transduction pathways may yield new insight into crosstalks of regulatory mechanisms essential for development and disease pathophysiology leading to novel therapeutics.
