Cardiometabolic risk describes a collection of risk factors, with a likely underlying pathophysiology, resulting in accelerated atherosclerosis and the terminal cardiovascular events of myocardial infarction and stroke. Beta-blockers, which are divided as vasodilators or non-vasodilators, are used in the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. Vasodilators have been shown to be of particular benefit in both blood pressure control and other cardiometabolic components with limited disturbance in metabolic parameters. Nebivolol, a third-generation beta-blocker (BB), acts by increasing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. This property may be especially important in NO-deficient population, such as black people, in regulating both blood pressure control and glucose homeostasis.
