Temporary percutaneous mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices were introduced in the 1960s and have developed into a diverse portfolio of options currently available for left, right, and biventricular support. Patients undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and patients with cardiogenic shock in particular may benefit from these options. In this review, we will discuss the currently available devices and the evidence supporting their use in cardiogenic shock. Â© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.
