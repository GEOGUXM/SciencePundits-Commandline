Background: GAPDH, well known for its house-keeping functions, has also been shown to be involved in cell injury, apoptosis and death under conditions of stress such as starvation, chemical injury and oxidative stress. This study examines the effect of GAPDH knockdown on cell injury in response to Rotenone. Methods: GAPDH was knocked down in H9C2 cardiomyoblasts using siRNA prior to exposure to rotenone (0. nM, 20. nM, 40. nM and 80. nM). Autophagy was detected by western blot for autophagy proteins (Beclin-1, Atg5, LC-3A/B and p62) and MDC staining for acidic substances. Pro-apoptosis protein and flow cytometry were used to assess cell apoptosis and death and intracellular ATP relative concentration was measured. Oxidant stress was assessed by measuring DCFH-DA, TBARS, GSH and SOD. Results: In this study, GAPDH-knockdown enhanced autophagy in rotenone-induced H9C2 cells, decreased oxidant stress and increased antioxidant pathways; and reduced cell apoptosis and death. Furthermore, GAPDH-knockdown preserved cell energy. Conclusion: siRNA-mediated GAPDH knockdown reduced rotenone-induced H9C2 cell death occurring via autophagy and anti-oxidative stress pathway. This study enriches the understanding of GAPDH pathophysiology role, and provides potential new therapeutic targets for cardiac disease states characterized by oxidative stress.
