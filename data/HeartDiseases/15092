The optimal revascularization strategy in patients with diabetes is controversial. The Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation (BARI) trial, done more than a decade ago, suggested a mortality benefit of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) when compared with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (with plain old balloon angioplasty) in the subgroup of patients with diabetes. In addition, several observational studies and meta-analyses similarly suggest a benefit of CABG over PCI in patients with diabetes. However, most of these studies compared CABG with PCI using balloon angioplasty, bare metal stents, or first-generation drug-eluting stents. In this review, we critically examine the data for optimal revascularization strategy in patients with diabetes and ask the question whether the currently available data from randomized trials that used outdated stents are applicable to current day practice.
