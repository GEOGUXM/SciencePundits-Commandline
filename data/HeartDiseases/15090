Despite decreases in rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) nationwide, racial differences in incidence of CVD persist. In fact, the racial disparity in incidence of CVD may only be increasing as CVD rates have been declining unequally in certain ethnicities. As prior risk stratification calculators such as the Framingham Risk Score do not take into account ethnicity, other measures of CVD risk from biomarkers and subclinical measurements of atherosclerosis may be potentially important to help clinicians close the racial disparity in CVD rates. Through measurement of coronary artery calcium, ankle-brachial index, biomarkers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, carotid intima-media thickness, and family history, investigators have improved the prediction of subclinical measurements of atherosclerosis across all races. Yet not all of these tools are equally effective in predicting CVD across ethnicities, as will be discussed in this paper. Â© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.
