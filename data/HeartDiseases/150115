Background: Chronic Chagas Disease cardiomyopathy (CCC), a life-threatening inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy, affects 30% of the approximately 8 million patients infected by Trypanosoma cruzi, the rest of the infected subjects remaining asymptomatic (ASY). The Th1 T cell-rich myocarditis plays a pivotal role in CCC pathogenesis. Local expression of IL-18 in CCC myocardial tissue has recently been described. IL-18 could potentially amplify the process by inducing increased expression of IFN-γ which in turn can increase the production of IL-18, thereby creating a positive feedback mechanism. In order to assess the contribution of the IL-18 to susceptibility to Chronic Chagas Disease, we investigated the association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the IL-18 gene with the risk of developing Chagas cardiomyopathy. Methods and results: We analyzed the rs2043055 marker in the IL18 gene in a cohort of Chagas disease cardiomyopathy patients (. n=. 849) and asymptomatic subjects (. n=. 202). We found a significant difference in genotype frequencies among moderate and severe CCC patients with ventricular dysfunction. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that the IL18 rs2043055 polymorphism- or a SNP in tight linkage disequilibrium with it- may contribute to modulating the Chagas cardiomyopathy outcome. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
