Objective: Recent studies have suggested that metformin may inhibit endothelialization following limus-eluting stent (LES) placement and may increase the risk of stent thrombosis. Therefore, we assessed the impact of metformin on stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients who receive drug-eluting stents (DES). Methods: We assessed the impact of metformin and stent type on stent thrombosis, MACE, and death in NIDDM patients following DES placement. Of the 1201 patients included, 74.8% received LES, 25.2% received paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES), and 55% were taking metformin. Results: There was no difference in stent thrombosis, regardless of stent type or metformin use. While Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated reduced MACE (. p=0.007) and death (. p=0.006) with metformin use, multivariate analysis demonstrated that stent type and metformin use were not associated with outcome. Conclusion: In NIDDM patients, metformin use or stent type following DES placement did not increase stent thrombosis and MACE rates. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
