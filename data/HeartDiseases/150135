Ferric carboxymaltose (Ferinject®, Injectafer®) is an important intravenous iron preparation option for the treatment of iron deficiency. A single high dose [up to 750 mg (USA) or 1000 mg (EU) of iron] can be administered intravenously in a short time frame (15 min). Thus, fewer doses of ferric carboxymaltose may be needed to replenish iron stores relative to some other intravenous iron preparations. Ferric carboxymaltose improved self-reported patient global assessment, New York Heart Association functional class and exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure and iron deficiency in the FAIR-HF and CONFIRM-HF trials. In other trials, ferric carboxymaltose replenished iron stores and corrected anaemia in various populations with iron-deficiency anaemia, including patients with chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease or heavy uterine bleeding, postpartum iron-deficiency anaemia and perioperative anaemia. Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose was generally well tolerated, with a very low risk of hypersensitivity reactions. In general, it was better tolerated than oral ferrous sulfate, mainly reflecting a lower incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects. The higher acquisition cost of ferric carboxymaltose was offset by lower costs for other items, with the potential for cost savings. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.
