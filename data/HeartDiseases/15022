Objective: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with fat and autonomic system dysfunction. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) plays an endocrine role over the heart. Since orosomucoid (ORM) has local actions around the coronaries, our aim was to assess the relationship between its secretion profile by EAT and its catecholaminergic regulation in patients with T2DM and coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: We obtained EAT, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and plasma from 55 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Fat explants were stimulated with isoproterenol (ISO) 1μM for 6h. After, the fat explants released-ORM and plasma levels were analyzed by ELISA. mRNA or protein expression was analyzed by real time PCR or western blot, respectively. The effects of ORM on endothelial cells were analyzed by impedance and wound healing assays. Results: We observed that EAT-released ORM levels were higher than SAT (328±185 vs 58±45ng/mL; p<0.001). Interestingly, EAT secretion was lower in patients with than those without T2DM (260±141 vs 370±194ng/mL; p<0.05) and this difference was enhanced after ISO stimulation (. p<0.01). However, plasma levels (412±119 vs 594±207μg/mL) and EAT-released ORM levels were higher in patients with than those without CAD (384±195 vs 279±159ng/mL; p<0.05). ISO stimulation, also reduced the EAT released-ORM levels in patients with CAD. On human endothelial cells, ORM induced an increase of healing and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: EAT-released ORM levels in patients with T2DM or CAD and its regulation by catecholamines might be the mirror of local endothelium dysfunction or inflammatory process in different cardiovascular disorders. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
