Background: Restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a remained clinical problem which limits long-term success of PCI. Although there was recognition that probucol in treating restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, the efficacy of probucol on restenosis after stent-implantation is controversial. So this meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between probucol and late restenosis. Methods: Articles were assessed by four trained investigators, with divergences resolved by consensus. PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect and the Cochrane Central Register of clinical trials were searched for pertinent studies. Inclusion criteria were random allocated to treatment and a comparison of probucol-treated patients and control patients (not treated with lipid-lowering drug) undergoing PCI. Results: Fifteen studies with 859 subjects were analyzed. Major outcome, binary angiographic restenosis defined as >50% stenosis upon follow-up angiography, was significantly decreased with probucol treatment (RR = 0.59 [0.43, 0.80] among vessels, P = 0.0007; and RR = 0.52 [0.40, 0.68] among patients, P<0.00001). Probucol also increased the minimal luminal diameter (SMD = 0.45 [0.30, 0.61], P< 0.00001) and decreased late loss upon follow-up after 6 months (SMD = -0.41 [-0.60, -0.22], P<0.0001). Moreover, there was a significantly lower incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in the probucol group than control group (RR = 0.69 [0.51, 0.93], P = 0.01). Conclusion: Probucol is more than a lipid-lowering drug. It is also effective in reducing the risk of restenosis and incidence of MACE after PCI. Â© 2015 Liu et al.
