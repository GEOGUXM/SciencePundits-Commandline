Objective: The efficacy of antiplatelet drugs may differ in specific patient subgroups. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of the P2Y<inf>12</inf> inhibitors clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel, ticagrelor, and cangrelor according to diabetes status, age, gender, body mass index, and body weight. Methods: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of P2Y<inf>12</inf> inhibitors reporting information on cardiovascular disease (defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death) and bleeding (defined as any bleeding) events among the subgroups diabetes and non-diabetes, age ≥65 and <65 year-old, men and women, body mass index ≥30 and <30kg/m2, and body weight ≥60 and <60kg, were identified in Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library on August 31st, 2014. For each inhibitor, random-effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the ratio of relative risks (rRR) for cardiovascular and bleeding events among patient subgroups. Results: Twenty distinct RCTs (233285 participants, 21323 cardiovascular and 5183 bleeding events) were identified. Cardiovascular risk reduction with clopidogrel did not significantly differ according to diabetes (rRR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.13; p=0.395), age (0.98; 0.88 to 1.09; p=0.347), gender (0.97; 0.90 to 1.04; p=0.382), or body mass index (1.11, 0.95 to 1.31; p=0.191). Results for other inhibitors were comparable, although available data were sparse. Limited data on bleeding events were available. Conclusion: Data from RCTs did not show a different cardiovascular efficacy of clopidogrel in diabetes mellitus and other clinically relevant subgroups. Limited information was available on the efficacy and safety of other P2Y<inf>12</inf> inhibitors in specific subgroups. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
