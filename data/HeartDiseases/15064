Although the role of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in improving outcomes in ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) has been described, the data regarding gender-based survival outcomes are limited. There is a higher preponderance of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) in women, and most of the ICM literature is derived from sub-study analysis. This review summarizes the current body of literature on prognosis, pathophysiology, and the present clinical practice for device implantation in women with ICM.
