Objective To investigate the effect of late treatment with intravenous paracetamol on patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure prior to possible PDA ligation. Methods A retrospective review of infants with a haemodynamically significant PDA, considered for PDA ligation and treated with intravenous paracetamol prior to possible ligation. Results Thirty six infants with a median gestation of 26.1 weeks received paracetamol at a median age of 27 days. Paracetamol was associated with immediate closure in nine (25%) infants. There was no response to paracetamol treatment in four (11%) infants who subsequently underwent a PDA ligation. In 23 (64%) infants, the PDA constricted and all but one of this group demonstrated complete PDA closure prior to discharge. Conclusions There may be a role for intravenous paracetamol in late closure of infants with a significant PDA to avoid ligation. The use of paracetamol for late treatment of PDA should be systematically evaluated.
