Objective: To evaluate the relationships of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) concentration and apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) phenotype to major adverse cardiovascular events after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in long-term follow-up. Methods: This single-center study included 356 patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD) who underwent successful CABG. At baseline, we assessed the patient's risk factor profile for atherosclerosis, Lp(a) concentration and apo(a) phenotype. The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI). The secondary endpoint also included hospitalization for recurrent or unstable angina and repeat revascularization. Results: Over a mean of 8.5±3.5 years (range 0.9-15.0 years), the primary and secondary endpoints were registered in 46 (13%) and 107 (30%) patients, respectively. Patients with Lp(a) ≥30mg/dL were at significantly greater risk for the primary endpoint (hazard ratio (HR) 2.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.76-5.03, p<0.001) and secondary endpoint (HR 3.47, 95% CI 2.48-4.85, p<0.001) than patients with Lp(a) values <30mg/dL. The low molecular-weight apo(a) phenotype was also associated with higher risk of both primary and secondary endpoints (3.57 (1.87-6.82) and 3.05 (2.00-4.62), respectively; p<0.001 for both), regardless of conventional risk factors and statins use. Conclusion: In stable CHD patients Lp(a) concentration and low molecular-weight apo(a) phenotype are independently associated with three-fold increase in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events within 15 years after CABG. Lp(a) levels may provide an additional information for postoperative cardiovascular risk assessment. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
