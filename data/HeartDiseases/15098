Epidemiological studies have revealed an association between sulfur dioxide (SO<inf>2</inf>) exposure and cardiovascular diseases. This study is designed to investigate the SO<inf>2</inf> effect on the expression of ATP-sensitive K+ (K<inf>ATP</inf>) channel and L-type calcium (L-Ca2+) channel in rat hearts. The results show that the mRNA and protein levels of the K<inf>ATP</inf> channel subunits Kir6.2 and SUR2A of rat hearts in SO<inf>2</inf> groups were higher than those in control group. SO<inf>2</inf> at 14mg/m3 significantly decreased the expression of the L-Ca2+ channel subunits Ca<inf>v</inf>1.2 and Ca<inf>v</inf>1.3. This suggests that SO<inf>2</inf> can activate the K<inf>ATP</inf> channels by up-regulating the expression of Kir6.2 and SUR2A, while it inhibits the L-Ca2+ channels by down-regulating the expression of Ca<inf>v</inf>1.2 and Ca<inf>v</inf>1.3 in rat hearts. The molecular mechanism of SO<inf>2</inf>-induced negative inotropic effect might be linked to the expression changes of these subunits, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of SO<inf>2</inf>-associated cardiovascular diseases.
