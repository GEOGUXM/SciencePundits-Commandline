Background: Prospective studies have found low bilirubin levels were an important predictive factor of cardiovascular events. However, few have yet investigated possible association between serum bilirubin level and LVH in essential hypertension. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between serum bilirubin levels with LVH in newly diagnosed hypertension patients. Methods: The present study evaluated the relationship between serum total bilirubin level and left ventricle hypertrophy (LVH) in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients with a sample size of 344. We divided subjects into LVH group (n=138) and non-LVH group (n=206). Physical examination, laboratory tests and echocardiography were conducted. The multivariate logistic regression model was used to verify the independent association between RDW and LVH. Results: Our results found that patients with LVH had lower bilirubin levels than non-LVH ones. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed total bilirubin level (B=-0.017, P=0.008) was negatively associated with left ventricle mass index (LVMI) even adjusting for some confounders. The multiples logistic regression found total bilirubin level was independently related with of LVH, as a protective factors (OR=0.91, P =0.010). Conclusion: As a routine and quick laboratory examination index, serum bilirubin may be treated as novel marker for evaluating LVH risk in hypertensive patients. Cohort study with larger sample size are needed. Â© 2015 Zhou et al.
