Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the efficacy of fibrate therapy in reducing plasma concentration or activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). Methods: Scopus and MEDLINE databases were searched (up to October 15, 2014) to identify RCTs investigating whether fibrates lower plasma PAI-1 concentration or activity. A random-effects model and the generic inverse variance method were used for quantitative data synthesis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using the one-study remove approach. Random-effects meta-regression was performed to assess the impact of potential moderators on the estimated effect sizes. Results: A total of 14 RCTs examining the effects of gemfibrozil (6 trials), bezafibrate (4 trials), and fenofibrate (5 trials) were included. Meta-analysis suggested that fibrate therapy did not significantly reduce plasma PAI-1 concentration (weighed mean difference [WMD]:-11.39ng/mL, 95% CI:-26.64, 3.85, p=0.143) or activity (WMD: 2.02U/mL, 95% CI:-0.87, 4.90, p=0.170). These results remained unchanged after subgroup analysis according to duration of treatment (<12 and ≥12 weeks) and type of fibrate administered (fenofibrate, bezafibrate or gemfibrozil). The estimated effects of fibrate therapy on plasma concentration and activity of PAI-1 were independent of treatment duration and changes in plasma triglyceride levels in the meta-regression analysis. Conclusion: This meta-analysis of RCTs suggested that fibrate therapy does not reduce plasma concentration or activity of PAI-I. The putative benefits of fibrate therapy in patients with cardiovascular disease appear to be exerted via mechanisms independent of effects on PAI-1. © 2015.
