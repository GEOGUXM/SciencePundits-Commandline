This paper presents the development of a simple portable biomedical electronic device to detect cardiac arrhythmias in humans. It identifies three main parts: an electrocardiograph, a device for data communication and a personal computer with software for diagnosis. The system performs automatic diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias by comparing the patient's electrocardiogram with those contained in a database stored in a personal computer. The biomedical device performance is satisfactory and it demonstrated its usefulness even in the absence of medical specialist in cardiology. Â© 2015 The Authors.
