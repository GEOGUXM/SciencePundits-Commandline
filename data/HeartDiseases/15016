Injectable nanomaterials have been designed for the treatment of myocardial infarction, particularly during the acute stages of inflammation and injury. Among these strategies, injectable nanofibrous hydrogel networks or nanoparticle complexes may be delivered alone or with a therapeutic to improve heart function. Intramyocardial delivery of these materials localizes treatments to the site of injury. As an alternative, nanoparticles may be delivered intravenously, which provides the ultimate minimally invasive approach. These systems take advantage of the leaky vasculature after myocardial infarction, and may be designed to specifically target the injured region. The translational applicability of both intramyocardial and intravenous applications may provide safe and effective solutions upon optimizing the timing of the treatments and biodistribution.
