Newer generation drug-eluting stents have improved outcomes in various subsets of coronary lesions including bifurcation lesions. This article reviews the current literature on various issues in bifurcation percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Generally, the provisional approach of placing one stent in the main vessel is the preferred first-line treatment for most bifurcation lesions. However, some lesions require 2-stenting. It is unknown whether 2nd-generation DES have improved outcomes with 2-stenting. The use of fractional flow reserve (FFR) for the assessment of functional significance of the jailed side branch can help avoid unnecessary stenting in complex lesions. Skilled techniques in every step of the 2-stenting process and meticulous use of imaging techniques including IVUS or OCT are warranted to obtain optimal angiographic and clinical results. Dedicated bifurcation stents are feasible treatment options and may change future concepts in bifurcation PCI, although larger trials with control groups are required in order to widely apply these techniques into daily routine practice.
