This study investigated safety and efficacy of GSK256073, an in vitro potent, selective GPR109A agonist, for treatment of subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Type 2 DM) poorly controlled with metformin alone. Patients with Type 2 DM (n=94) were enroled into this randomised, double-blind (sponsor unblinded), placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. Participants received placebo for two weeks before being randomised (2:2:2:2:1:1) to receive doses of GSK256073 5 mg twice-daily (BID), 10 mg once-daily (QD), 25 mg BID, 50 mg QD or placebo BID or QD in addition to their current metformin treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at week 12. The safety profile of GSK256073 did not significantly differ from that of placebo. Decreases from baseline in HbA1c were observed in all treatment groups but were not statistically significant compared to placebo; at week 12 a maximum decrease of 0.30% from placebo was reached in the GSK256073 50 mg QD group. On day 2, GSK256073 significantly decreased non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) (0-12 h) concentrations but pharmacological activity was lost (5 mg BID, 10 mg QD, 25 mg BID) or reduced (50 mg QD) at week 6. Drug exposure demonstrated 2-fold accumulation over 6 weeks. The primary efficacy objective of the study was not met. GSK256073 did not improve HbA1c concentrations at week 12. Despite sustained drug exposure, the ability of the HCA2 agonist to suppress plasma NEFA concentrations waned over time and targeted effects on glucose oxidation and insulin sensitivity subsided.
