Cardiovascular diseases are an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and the global burden of these diseases continues to grow. Therefore new therapies are urgently needed. The role of protein kinases in disease, including cardiac disease, is long recognized, making kinases important therapeutic targets. We here review the knowledge gathered in the last decade about troponin I-interacting kinase (TNNI3K), a kinase with cardiac-restricted expression that has been implicated in various cardiac phenotypes and diseases including heart failure, cardiomyopathy, ischemia/reperfusion injury and conduction of the cardiac electrical impulse.
