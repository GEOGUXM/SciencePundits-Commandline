Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) suffer excess mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) that has persisted despite substantial reductions in microvascular complications. Although T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are etiologically distinct, it has generally been assumed that CVD in T1D is “the same disease” as that found in T2D. Here, we review the most recent epidemiological and clinical studies on heart disease in T1D, highlighting differences between CVD in T1D and T2D. In addition, we discuss experimental and clinical evidence for a post-myocardial infarction (MI) autoimmune heart syndrome in T1D, including the development of diagnostic assays which we believe can, for the first time, differentiate between heart disease in T1D and T2D. We postulate that a clinically unrecognized form of chronic myocardial inflammation (“myocarditis”) triggered by MI contributes to the poor CVD outcomes in T1D. These findings provide a conceptual shift in our understanding of CVD in T1D and have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. © 2015, The Author(s).
