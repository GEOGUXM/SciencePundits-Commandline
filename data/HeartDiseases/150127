Human liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (hL-FABP), which is found in both the normal and the diseased human kidney, has been observed to bind free fatty acids. Recently, the predictive and prognostic value of L-FABP in kidney diseases has attracted considerable attention. Numerous studies have demonstrated that L-FABP is a promising biomarker of several kidney diseases, and it has also been shown to attenuate renal injury. We performed a literature review regarding the ability of L-FABP to identify patients at risk of developing kidney diseases, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to protect the kidneys in the course of kidney disease.
