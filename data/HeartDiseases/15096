Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) plays an important role in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Smoking is known to reduc. e PON1 activity. We aimed to investigate the effects of interactions between PON1 variants and smoking on CHD in the Singaporean Chinese population. Methods: In a case-control study nested within Singapore Chinese Health Study (N=1914), subjects with and without CHD were classified into never-smokers and ever-smokers (ever smoked at least one cigarette a day for 1 year or longer). Associations at four independent SNPs at the PON1 locus (rs3735590, rs3917550, rs662, rs3917481) with CHD were evaluated using logistic regression, before/after stratification on smoking status. Interactions between smoking and PON1 variants were analyzed with likelihood ratio tests, by including the SNP * smoking interaction term in regression analyses. Results: The T allele at the coding SNP, rs662, was associated with higher risk of CHD in ever-smokers only (OR=1.35, 95% CI 1.08-1.68; adjusted P=0.036). At the miR-SNP, rs3735590, carrying at least one copy of minor allele T was associated with increased risk of CHD in a dominant manner in never-smokers only (OR=1.53, 95% CI 1.11-2.11; adjusted P=0.036). Significant interactions between two PON1 SNPs and smoking in relation to CHD risk were identified (adjusted P=0.012 for rs662; adjusted P=0.044 for rs3735590). These associations remained significant after adjustment for known CHD risk factors and upon correction for multiple tests. Conclusions: Two PON1 SNPs, rs662 and rs3735590, were found to significantly interact with cigarette smoking to modulate the risk of CHD in the Singaporean Chinese population.
