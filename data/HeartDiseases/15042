In an attempt to reduce the heart failure epidemic, screening and prevention will become an increasing focus of management in the wider at-risk population. Refining risk prediction through the use of biomarkers in isolation or in combination is emerging as a critical step in this process. The utility of biomarkers to identify disease manifestations before the onset of symptoms and detrimental myocardial damage is proving to be valuable. In addition, biomarkers that predict the likelihood and rate of disease progression over time will help streamline and focus clinical efforts and therapeutic strategies. Importantly, several recent early intervention studies using biomarker strategies are promising and indicate that not only can new-onset heart failure be reduced but also the development of other cardiovascular conditions.
