Technical advancements in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging over the past two decades have allowed clinically useful imaging of the thin atrial wall for the first time. During this period, there has been a parallel increase in the use of catheter ablation to treat atrial fibrillation (AF). These developments have led to new indications for and increasing use of CMR in the assessment of pre- and post-ablation atrial structure and function and their potential link to arrhythmia substrate. This review focuses on the role of CMR in the assessment of acute and chronic post-ablation atrial tissue characterisation and its potential use in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias.
