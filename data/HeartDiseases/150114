People with chronic kidney disease frequently experience cardiovascular events. This study sought to investigate whether the presence of albuminuria displays a vascular risk equivalent to that in patients with prior myocardial infarction. Methods: Albuminuria was defined as a urinary albumin to creatinine ratio of 30μg/mg or greater in 852 consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography. Prospectively, we recorded vascular events over 3.2±1.2 years. Results: From our patients, 513 (60.2%) had neither albuminuria nor a history of MI, 126 (14.8%) had albuminuria without prior MI, 137 (16.1%) did not have albuminuria but had a history of MI, and 76 (8.9%) had both, albuminuria and prior MI. Compared with the incidence of the composite endpoint among normoalbuminuric patients with no prior MI (11.9%), event rates nearly doubled both in patients with albuminuria without prior MI (24.6%; p=0.003) and in normoalbuminuric patients with a history of prior MI (21.2%; p=0.004) and were highest in patients with both, albuminuria and prior MI (36.8%; p<0.001). Importantly, event rates were not significantly different between patients with albuminuria and no prior history of MI and those with normoalbuminuria but prior MI (p=0.972). Moreover, the event rate in patients with both, albuminuria and history of MI, was significantly higher (p<0.05) than in the two groups exhibiting only one of the two conditions. Conclusion: This is the first study demonstrating that albuminuria is a CAD risk equivalent. Thus, cardiovascular risk factors in albuminuric patients should be treated as aggressively as in patients with prior MI. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
