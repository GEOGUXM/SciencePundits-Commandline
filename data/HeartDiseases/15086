Background: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21), a newly discovered adipokine, plays an important role in glucose and lipid metabolism and is associated with the development of metabolic disorders, such as obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to investigate the association of serum FGF-21 levels with the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods: Total 113 patients with AF and 60 healthy control subjects were enrolled. All AF cases were categorized into paroxysmal, persistent and permanent AF. Serum levels of FGF-21, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and other routine biochemical parameters were measured. Results: Serum FGF-21 levels were significantly higher in AF patients than in controls (250.12. ±. 78.48 vs. 144.15. ±. 56.31. pg/mL, P<. 0.001), and hs-CRP levels were significantly higher in AF patients than in controls (2.36. ±. 1.10 vs. 1.24. ±. 0.82, P<. 0.05). In subgroup studies, patients with permanent AF had higher serum FGF-21 levels than those with persistent and paroxysmal AF. After the adjustment of the age, gender and body mass index, serum FGF-21 levels were positively correlated with left atrial diameter (LAD) (. P<. 0.01). A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that FGF-21, LAD and hs-CRP were correlated with AF (. P<. 0.05). Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that serum FGF-21 levels are elevated in AF patients and associated with atrial remolding, independent of established risk factors such as C-reactive protein. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
