Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and noninvasive strategies to diagnose and risk stratify patients remain paramount in the evaluative process. Stress echocardiography is a well-established, versatile, real-time imaging modality with advantages including lack of radiation exposure, portability, and affordability. Innovative techniques in stress echocardiography include myocardial contrast echocardiography, deformation imaging, three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography, and assessment of coronary flow reserve. Myocardial perfusion imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) are imaging alternatives, and stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography, including CT perfusion imaging, are emerging as newer approaches. This review will discuss recent and upcoming developments in the field of stress testing, with an emphasis on stress echocardiography while highlighting comparisons with other modalities.
