Background: Whether angiographic coronary severity really predicts future major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is uncertain. Few studies have compared the efficacy of SYNTAX, Gensini and Jeopardy scores in predicting MACE in stable CAD. Methods: We collected data of MACE, including all-cause mortality, all strokes, new myocardial infarction and unplanned repeat revascularization, in subjects with stable CAD from our catheterization databank. Coronary severity was graded with SYNTAX, Gensini and Jeopardy scoring systems. Results: During a median follow-up period of 42. months, 39 out of the 181 subjects developed at least 1 MACE. Those with MACE had a significantly higher baseline high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (p = 0.025). Multivariate analysis showed that coronary severity score, hs-CRP and diabetes mellitus were significant predictors for MACE. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed a significant difference in MACE-free rates between SYNTAX binary scores (≥ 15 vs < 15, p = 0.043), Gensini binary scores (≥ 36 vs < 36, p = 0.048) and Jeopardy binary scores (≥ 4 vs < 4, p = 0.001). Conclusion: Coronary severity score, hs-CRP and diabetes mellitus independently predicted MACE in patients with stable CAD. The Jeopardy score is simple to calculate and as effective for predicting MACE in stable CAD as the complex SYNTAX score. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
