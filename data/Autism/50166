Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) frequently have ophthalmologic disorders. Due to poor cooperation with ophthalmological examination, ocular abnormalities in such children may be overlooked. We retrospectively studied the records of 324 patients diagnosed as ASD that underwent ophthalmological examination between January 2011 and November 2014 at Dr. Sami Ulus Maternity and Children Research and Training Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. Ophthalmic pathology was noted in 26.9 % of patients with ASD, of which 22 % had significant refractive errors and 8.6 % had strabismus. Comprehensive eye examination by a pediatric ophthalmologist is recommended for all children diagnosed as ASD. Â© 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
