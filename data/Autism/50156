The purpose of this study was to explore the psychometric properties of the Brief Autism Mealtime Behaviors Inventory (BAMBI). In a sample of 273 well-characterized children with ASD, we explored the factor structure of the BAMBI, determined the internal consistency of a newly derived factor structure and provide an empirically derived cut-off for the BAMBI total score. The new psychometrically identified structure consists of 4 factors: (1) Food Selectivity, (2) Disruptive Mealtime Behaviors, (3) Food Refusal and (4) Mealtime Rigidity. Internal consistency was acceptable. A cut off score of 34 is suggested based on our results. The new 15-item BAMB with an alternative 4-factor structure with clinical utility is promising in assessing feeding and mealtime problems in children with ASD.
