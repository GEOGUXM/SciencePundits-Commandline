There is an ongoing need to identify stimuli that may function as reinforcers due to the reliance on reinforcement techniques during teaching. Three commonly used stimulus preference assessments (SPAs) are the single-stimulus (SS; Pace et al., Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 18, 249–255, 1985), paired-stimulus (PS; Fisher et al., Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 25, 491–498, 1992), and multiple-stimulus-without-replacement (MSWO; DeLeon and Iwata, Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 29, 519–533, 1996) preference assessments. The current study examined the effectiveness of video modeling with voiceover instruction to train staff to conduct these SPAs. The results demonstrated that video modeling was effective, and staff trainees demonstrated high levels of integrity during generalization and follow-up probes. These results support recent research that suggests video modeling is an effective approach to staff training. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
