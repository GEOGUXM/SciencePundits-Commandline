This study presents a literature review of interventions for improving daily living skills of individuals with ASD. This review investigated the quality of the design and evidence of the literature base and determined the state of the evidence base related to interventions for improving daily living skills of individuals with ASD. Included studies were evaluated to determine the overall quality of the evidence for each design within each article, based on the What Works Clearinghouse standards for single-case experimental design (Kratochwill et al. 2010), adapted by Maggin et al. (Remedial Spec Educ 34(1):44–58, 2013. doi:10.1177/0741932511435176). As a result, video modeling was found to be an evidence-based practice. Limitations and implications for future research and for practitioners are discussed. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
