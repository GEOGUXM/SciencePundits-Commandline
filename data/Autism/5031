The present pilot study investigated the impact of video hero modelling (VHM) on the daily living skills of an elementary-aged student with autism spectrum disorder. The VHM, in which a character much admired by the student exhibited a correct response, was shown to the participant immediately before the situation where he needed to exhibit the target behaviours. Results of a multiple-probe design across three behaviours showed that each of the three target behaviours improved only when the VHM was introduced. In addition, the participant and his teachers demonstrated positive attitudes toward the use of VHM. However, the teachers hesitated to develop the VHM by themselves due to the perceived complexity of the development process and time constraints. Â© 2015 Taylor & Francis
