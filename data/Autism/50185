This study examined the efficacy of the Child-Directed Interaction Training (CDIT) phase of Parent–Child Interaction Therapy for children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Thirty mother–child dyads with children ages 3–7 years with a diagnosis of ASD participated in this randomized controlled study. Following manualized CDIT, statistically significant and meaningful improvements in child disruptive behavior and social awareness as well as maternal distress associated with child disruptive behavior occurred. Across 8 sessions, mothers learned to provide positive attention to their children's appropriate social and play behaviors. Both child and parent changes were maintained at 6-week follow-up. A relatively brief, time-limited, and accessible intervention may be efficacious for improving child and parent behaviors in families of young children with ASD. By decreasing child disruptive behaviors, CDIT may also help to prepare children to benefit further from future interventions. 2015 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC
