Sex differences in social behaviors exist in mammals during adulthood, and further evidence suggests that sex differences in behavior are present before sexual maturity. In order to model behavioral disorders in animals, it is important to assess baseline sex-related behavioral differences, especially when studying disorders for which sex-related behavioral effects are expected. We investigated the effect of sex on behavior in three strains of prepubertal mice (C57BL/6, CFW, and CF1) using a wheel-running assay. We found no significant sex differences in latency to run on the wheel or total duration of wheel running within each strain. During the social interaction test, there were no differences between the sexes in latency or total duration of contact or following between a subject and a novel mouse. We also evaluated behavioral patterns of wheel running and stereotypical behaviors such as burrowing and grooming. Both sexes showed characteristic wheel-running behavior, spending the majority of each trial interacting with the wheel when it was free and more time performing other activities (e.g., stereotypical behaviors, general locomotion) when it was jammed. These results provide evidence that, among various strains of prepubertal mice, baseline sex-related behavioral differences are not strong enough to influence the measured behaviors.
