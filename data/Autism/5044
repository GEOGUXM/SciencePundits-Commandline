Abstract The purpose of this study was to assess the intensity of physical activity (PA) that secondary school-aged students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and typically developing (TD) students exert during a school day, and to compare the percentages of students achieving the recommended guidelines between groups. The PA of 60 male students (ASD, n = 30; TD, n = 30) was recorded every 10 s for up to 5 school days by performing uniaxial accelerometry. The main results are listed as follows: (a) daily PA was significantly lower among the students with ASD than among the TD students; (b) students with ASD spent significantly lower proportion of their time in moderate PA than TD students did during physical education (PE), recess, and lunchtime; and (c) fewer students with ASD than TD students achieved the PA guidelines during the school day and PE time. Schools should increase PA opportunities across the school day. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
