We examined predictors of outcome (IQ, adaptive behavior, and ASD severity) after 12 and 24 months of early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) in 71, 20–59 months old children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who were enrolled in publicly-funded, community-based agencies. Predictors included social engagement (combining variables loading onto a single factor: social approach, joint attention, and imitation) and sensorimotor rituals. Younger age and higher IQ at intake predicted favorable outcomes at both 12 and 24 months. Adjusting for age, IQ, baseline predictor scores, EIBI hours, treatment site, and sensorimotor rituals, social engagement predicted superior later IQ and adaptive behavior. In contrast, sensorimotor rituals did not predict outcome. Although limited by the absence of a control group, the study indicates social engagement predicts some EIBI outcomes. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
