We study aspects of holographic superconductors analytically in the presence of a constant external magnetic field. It is shown that the critical temperature and the critical magnetic field can be calculated at nonzero temperature. We detect the Meissner effect in such superconductors. A universal relation between black hole mass M and critical magnetic field Hc is proposed to be Hc /M2/3 ≤ 0.687365. We also discuss some aspects of phase transition in terms of black hole entropy and Bekensteins entropy to the energy upper bound. © 2015 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.
