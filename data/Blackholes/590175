We consider collision of two particles near static electrically charged extremal black holes and elucidate the conditions under which the energy in the centre of mass frame $$E_{c.m.}$$Ec.m. grows unbounded. For a single black hole, we generalize the results obtained earlier for the Reissner–Nordström metric, to distorted black holes. In the multi-black hole space-time, qualitatively new features appear. If the point of collision is close to at least two horizons simultaneously, unbounded $$E_{c.m.}$$Ec.m. are possible (i) without fine-tuning of particles’ parameters, (ii) for an arbitrary mutual orientation of two velocities. Such a combination of properties (i) and (ii) has no analogues in the single black hole case and facilitates the condition of getting unbounded $$E_{c.m.}$$Ec.m. Collisions in the electro-vacuum Majumdar–Papapetrou metric (several extremal black holes in equilibrium) is analyzed explicitly. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.
