In this paper, for pseudo-classical spinning particles, the gravitational effects of a black hole with the cosmic string has been studied. Acquiring the geodesic motions of the spinning particles by solving the generalized Killing equations, we discussed the bound state orbits in a plane. The results show that the existence of the cosmic string makes a difference to the gravitational effects of the black hole and distinguishes the case from the Schwarzschild space-time.
