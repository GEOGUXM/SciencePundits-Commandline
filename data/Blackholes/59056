We study the evolution of timelike geodesics for two dimensional black hole spacetimes arising in string theory and general theory of relativity by solving the Raychaudhuri equation for expansion scalar as an initial value problem. The possibility of geodesic focusing/defocusing is then examined accordingly with different settings of black hole parameters. In view of the geodesic focusing/defocusing, the critical value of expansion scalar is also calculated in each case. The effect of the charge and the cosmological constant on the evolution of expansion scalar for timelike geodesics is discussed in detail. Â© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
