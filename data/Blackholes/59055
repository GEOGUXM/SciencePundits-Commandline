In this paper, we consider massive charged Dirac fields propagating in the exterior region of de Sitter-Reissner-Nordström black holes. We show that the parameters of such black holes are uniquely determined by the partial knowledge of the corresponding scattering operator S(λ) at a fixed energy λ. More precisely, we consider the partial wave scattering operators S(λ, n) (here λ ∈ ℝ is the energy and n ∈ ℕ∗ denotes the angular momentum) defined as the restrictions of the full scattering operator on a well-chosen basis of spin-weighted spherical harmonics. We prove that the knowledge of the scattering operators S(λ, n), for all n ∈ L, where L is a subset of ℕ∗ that satisfies the Müntz condition Σ<inf>n∈L</inf> 1/n = +∞, makes it possible to recover the mass, the charge, and the cosmological constant of a de Sitter-Reissner-Nordström black hole. The main tool consists in the complexification of the angular momentum n and in studying the analytic properties of the 'unphysical' corresponding data in the complex variable z. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.
