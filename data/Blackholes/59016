We consider three-dimensional gravity based on torsion. Specifically, we consider an extension of the so-called Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity in the presence of a scalar field with a self-interacting potential, where the scalar field is non-minimally coupled with the torsion scalar. Then, we find asymptotically AdS hairy black hole solutions, which are characterized by a scalar field with a power-law behavior, being regular outside the event horizon and null at spatial infinity and by a self-interacting potential, which tends to an effective cosmological constant at spatial infinity.
