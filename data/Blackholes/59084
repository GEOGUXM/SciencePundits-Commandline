We calculate the excitonic spectrum of few-layer black phosphorus by direct diagonalization of the effective mass Hamiltonian in the presence of an applied in-plane electric field. The strong attractive interaction between electrons and holes in this system allows one to investigate the Stark effect up to very high ionizing fields, including also the excited states. Our results show that the band anisotropy in black phosphorus becomes evident in the direction-dependent field-induced polarizability of the exciton. Â© 2015 American Physical Society.
