It is well known that the SU(2) Reissner–Nordström black-hole solutions of the Einstein–Yang–Mills theory are characterized by an infinite set of unstable (imaginary) eigenvalues $$\{\omega _n(T_{\text {BH}})\}_{n=0}^{n=\infty }$${ωn(TBH)}n=0n=∞(here $$T_{\text {BH}}$$TBH is the black-hole temperature). In this paper we analyze the excited instability spectrum of these magnetically charged black holes. The numerical results suggest the existence of a universal behavior for these black-hole excited eigenvalues. In particular, we show that unstable eigenvalues in the regime $$\omega _n\ll T_{\text {BH}}$$ωn≪TBH are characterized, to a very good degree of accuracy, by the simple universal relation $$\omega _n(r_+-r_-)={\text {constant}}$$ωn(r+-r-)=constant, where $$r_{\pm }$$r± are the horizon radii of the black hole. © 2015, The Author(s).
