Using the modified Dirac equation in a three-dimensional gravity background, we investigate the quantum correction to tunnelling radiation from a Gödel black hole, and discuss the black hole remnant employing fermion’s tunnelling. The corrected tunnelling probability is derived, and the modified Hawking temperature is found as well. It is worth emphasizing that, only when the condition j>αω(3r<inf>−</inf>−r<inf>+</inf>) is satisfied, emitting both a mass particle and a massless particle, the remnant of the Gödel black hole may arise. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
