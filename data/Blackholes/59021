We compiled a sample of 24 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), 21 BL Lacs, 13 FRI and 12 FRII radio galaxies to study the jet power and broad-line luminosity relation, and the jet power and black hole mass relation. Furthermore, we obtain the histograms of key parameters. Our main results are as follows: (i) We found that the FSRQs are roughly separated from BL Lacs by the Ledlow–Owen FRI/FRII dividing line in the logP<inf>jet</inf>–logM plane. This result supports the unification model that BL Lacs unify with FRI radio galaxies and FSRQs unify with FRII radio galaxies. (ii) We found that the coefficient of the best-fit linear regression equation of logL<inf>BLR</inf>–logP<inf>jet</inf> relation is very close to 1 for our sample. The correlation between broad line luminosity and jet power is significant which supports that jet power has a close link with accretion. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
