We investigate the massive charged particles’ Hawking radiation from a Reissner-Nordström-de Sitter (RNdS) black hole by Damour-Ruffini’s method. We get the unthermal spectrum when the back-reaction of particles’ energy and charge to spacetime is considered. The information will get out from the black hole with the corrected spectrum. The radiation is not exactly thermal and because the derivation obeys conservation laws, the non thermal Hawking radiation can carry information from the black hole. In our work the method is more simple and explicit and it can be used to explain the black hole information loss paradox, and the process satisfies underlying unitary theory. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
