We study the collision of two particles in the Teo wormhole spacetime, in which the wormhole is stationary and axisymmetric. We show that a nonrotating Teo wormhole cannot be a high energy particle collider, while a rotating Teo wormhole can be used to accelerate particles and create high energy collisions because of the deep effective potential of the colliding particles. The process is different from that in the vicinity of a near-extremal black hole, since here there is no event horizon. This is the first example of particle collision with high center-of-mass energy in a spacetime with no event horizon and no naked singularity and not being extremal in a clear sense. The process can unlikely have direct implications for astrophysical observations, but it is interesting as a tool to investigate wormhole instabilities. Â© 2015 American Physical Society.
