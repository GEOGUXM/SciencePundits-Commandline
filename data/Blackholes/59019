In this paper we present the results of the determination of the magnetic field strength at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of an active galactic nuclei (AGN) derived from the polarimetric data for radiation emerging from broad line regions (BLR). These results are obtained by the radiative transfer method that takes into account the effect of Faraday rotation depolarization. The observed polarization degree allows to estimate the value of the magnetic field in the BLR and then to derive the ISCO magnetic field strength using the standard accretion disk model (Shakura and Sunyaev in Astron. Astrophys. 24:337, 1973). We used the polarimetric data obtained by Smith et al. (Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 335:773, 2002) to calculate the values of relativistic jet kinetic power of AGN from the derived values of the magnetic field strength at the ISCO radius.
