The proposal of pilgrim dark energy is based on the speculation that phantom-like dark energy (with strong enough resistive force) can prevent black hole formation in the universe. We explore this phenomenon in the loop quantum cosmology framework by taking pilgrim dark energy with a Hubble horizon. We evaluate the cosmological parameters such as the Hubble parameter, the equation of state parameter, the squared speed of sound, and also cosmological planes like (Formula presented.) and r–s on the basis of the pilgrim dark energy parameter (u) and the interacting parameter (d2). It is found that the values of the Hubble parameter lie in the range (Formula presented.). It is mentioned here that the equation of state parameter lies within the ranges (Formula presented.) for (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.), respectively. Also, the (Formula presented.) planes provide a ΛCDM limit, and freezing and thawing regions for all cases of $$u$$u. It is also interesting to mention here that the (Formula presented.) planes lie in the range ((Formula presented.)). In addition, r–s planes also correspond to ΛCDM for all cases of u. Finally, it is remarked that all the above constraints of the cosmological parameters (corresponding to (Formula presented.)) show consistency with different observational data like Planck, WP, BAO, H<inf>0</inf>, SNLS, and nine-year WMAP. © 2015, The Author(s).
