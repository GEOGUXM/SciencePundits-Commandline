In this paper, we address the issue of black hole solutions in (1+1)-dimensional nonprojectable Horava-Lifshitz gravity. We consider several models by considering different potentials in the scalar matter sector. We also consider the gravitational collapse of a distribution of pressureless dust filling a region in one-dimensional space. The time of the collapse can be faster or slower depending on the parameter λ of the theory. © 2015 American Physical Society.
