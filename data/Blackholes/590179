In this paper, we focus on the quantization of four-dimensional rotating linear dilaton black hole (RLDBH) spacetime describing an action, which emerges in the Einstein–Maxwell-dilaton–axion (EMDA) theory. RLDBH spacetime has a non-asymptotically flat geometry. When the rotation parameter “$$a$$a” vanishes, the spacetime reduces to its static form, the so-called linear dilaton black hole (LDBH) metric. Under scalar perturbations, we show that the radial equation reduces to a hypergeometric differential equation. Using the boundary conditions of the quasinormal modes (QNMs), we compute the associated complex frequencies of the QNMs. In a particular case, QNMs are applied in the rotational adiabatic invariant quantity, and we obtain the quantum entropy/area spectra of the RLDBH. Both spectra are found to be discrete and equidistant, and independent of the $$a$$a-parameter despite the modulation of QNMs by this parameter. © 2015, The Author(s).
