Using a WKB approximation of the Dirac equation in a curved spacetime, we obtain the expression for the phase shift between two neutrino mass eigenstates in a generic gravitational field. We apply this expression to two specific space-time geometries, namely the Kerr–Newman metric describing a rotating and charged black hole, and the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker metric. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.
