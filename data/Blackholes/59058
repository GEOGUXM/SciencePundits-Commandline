In this paper we investigate the tunneling of fermions from a general static Riemann black hole by following Kerner and Mann (Class Quantum Gravit 25:095014, 2008a; Phys Lett B 665:277–283, 2008b) methods. By applying the WKB approximation and the Hamilton–Jacobi ansatz to the Dirac equation, we obtain the standard Hawking temperature. Furthermore, Kerner and Mann (Class Quantum Gravit 25:095014, 2008a; Phys Lett B 665:277–283, 2008b) only calculated the tunneling spectrum of the Dirac particles with spin-up, and we extend the methods to investigate the tunneling of Dirac particles with arbitrary spin directions and also obtain the expected Hawking temperature. Our result provides further evidence for the universality of black hole radiation. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.
