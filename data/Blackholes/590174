The field equations for scalar–tensor–vector gravity (STVG) or modified gravity (MOG) have a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution determined by the mass M with two horizons. The strength of the gravitational constant is (Formula presented.) where (Formula presented.) is a parameter. A regular singularity-free MOG solution is derived using a nonlinear field dynamics for the repulsive gravitational field component and a reasonable physical energy-momentum tensor. The Kruskal–Szekeres completion of the MOG black hole solution is obtained. The Kerr-MOG black hole solution is determined by the mass M, the parameter (Formula presented.) and the spin angular momentum (Formula presented.). The equations of motion and the stability condition of a test particle orbiting the MOG black hole are derived, and the radius of the black hole photosphere and the shadows cast by the Schwarzschild-MOG and Kerr-MOG black holes are calculated. A traversable wormhole solution is constructed with a throat stabilized by the repulsive component of the gravitational field. © 2015, The Author(s).
