In (Int. Journ. Mod. Phys. D 14, 181 2005), the author Khriplovich verbatim claims that “the correspondence principle does not dictate any relation between the asymptotics of quasinormal modes and the spectrum of quantized black holes” and that “this belief is in conflict with simple physical arguments”. In this paper we analyze Khriplovich’s criticisms and realize that they work only for the original proposal by Hod, while they do not work for the improvements suggested by Maggiore and recently finalized by the author and collaborators through a connection between Hawking radiation and black hole (BH) quasi-normal modes (QNMs). This is a model of quantum BH somewhat similar to the historical semi-classical model of the structure of a hydrogen atom introduced by Bohr in 1913. Thus, QNMs can be really interpreted as BH quantum levels (the “electrons” of the “Bohr-like BH model”).Our results have also important implications on the BH information puzzle. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
