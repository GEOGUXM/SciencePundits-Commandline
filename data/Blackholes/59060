Vector particles’ Hawking radiation from a four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole is investigated. By applying the WKB approximation and the Hamilton-Jacobi ansatz to the Proca equation, we obtain the tunneling spectrum of vector particles and the expected Hawking temperature. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
