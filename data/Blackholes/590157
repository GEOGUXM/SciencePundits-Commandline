In this paper, we assume that the asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole thermodynamics parameters are identical with those of the polytropic gas. We find an asymptotically AdS solution of Einstein's equations in which the thermodynamics matches that of a special case of polytropic gas. The energy-momentum tensor corresponding to our solution obeys three energy conditions. Â© 2015 American Physical Society.
