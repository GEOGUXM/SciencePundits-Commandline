Using the WKB approximation method, the massless scalar quasinormal modes are studied in Reissner-Nordström-de Sitter quintessence spacetime. We analyze the effective potential and QNMs frequencies by varying angular harmonic index l, mass M, charge Q, quintessence energy b and cosmological constant L2. The results show the effective potential and QNMs frequency are related to l, M, Q, b and L2. Moreover, the b and L2 can make the effective potential and QNMs frequency reduces. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York
