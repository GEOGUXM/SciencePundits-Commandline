We investigate the Dirac and scalar particles tunnelling as a radiation of Warped AdS<inf>3</inf> black holes in Topological Massive Gravity. Using Hamilton-Jacobi method, we discuss tunnelling probability and Hawking temperature of the spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles for the black hole. We observe the tunnelling probability and Hawking temperature to be same for the spin-1/2 and spin-0. We show that the tunnelling process may occur, for both Dirac and scalar particles.
