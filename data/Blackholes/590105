We prove the existence and the uniqueness of the static dyonic black holes in four dimensional N = 1 supergravity theory coupled vector and scalar multiplets. We set the near-horizon geometry to be a product of two Einstein surfaces, whereas the asymptotic geometry has to be a space of constant scalar curvature. Using these data, we show that there exists a unique solution for scalar fields which interpolates these regions. Â© 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.
