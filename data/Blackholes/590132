A sample of 111 Fermi blazars each with a well-established radio core luminosity, broad-line luminosity, bolometric luminosity and black hole mass has been compiled from the literatures. We present a significant correlation between radio core and broad-line emission luminosities that supports a close link between accretion processes and relativistic jets. Analysis reveals a relationship of $\mathrm{Log}\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{BLR}}\sim(0.81\pm0.06)\mathrm{Log} \mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{R}}^{\mathrm{C}}$ which is consistant with theoretical predicted coefficient and supports that blazar jets are powered by energy extraction from a rapidly spinning Kerr black hole through the magnetic field provided by the accretion disk. Through studying the correlation between the intrinsic bolometric luminosity and the black hole mass, we find a relationship of $\mathrm{Log}\frac{\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{in}}}{\mathrm{L}_{\odot}}=(0.95\pm0.26)\mathrm{Log} \frac{\mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{M}_{\odot}}+(3.53\pm2.24)$ which supports mass-luminosity relation for Fermi blazars derived in this work is a powerlaw relation similar to that for main-sequence stars. Finally, EVOLUTIONARY SEQUENCE OF BLAZARS is discussed. Â© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
