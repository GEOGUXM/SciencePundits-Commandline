We study some aspects of black hole thermodynamics in the framework of a modified dispersion relation that admits a minimal length and a maximal momentum. We treat Hawking radiation from such a black hole via a tunneling mechanism and we compare our results with those obtained in alternative approaches to quantum gravity proposal.
