Astrophysical black holes could be nearly extremal (that is, rotating nearly as fast as possible); therefore, nearly extremal black holes could be among the binaries that current and future gravitational-wave observatories will detect. Predicting the gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes requires numerical-relativity simulations, but these simulations are especially challenging when one or both holes have mass m and spin S exceeding the Bowen-York limit of S/m2 = 0.93. We present improved methods that enable us to simulate merging, nearly extremal black holes (i.e., black holes with S/m2 > 0.93) more robustly and more efficiently. We use these methods to simulate an unequal-mass, precessing binary black hole (BBH) coalescence, where the larger black hole has S/m2 = 0.99. We also use these methods to simulate a non-precessing BBH coalescence, where both black holes have S/m2 = 0.994, nearly reaching the Novikov-Thorne upper bound for holes spun up by thin accretion disks. We demonstrate numerical convergence and estimate the numerical errors of the waveforms; we compare numerical waveforms from our simulations with post-Newtonian and effective-one-body waveforms; we compare the evolution of the black hole masses and spins with analytic predictions; and we explore the effect of increasing spin magnitude on the orbital dynamics (the so-called 'orbital hangup' effect).
