We derive the scalar waveform generated by a binary of nonspinning compact objects (black holes or neutron stars) in a general class of scalar-tensor theories of gravity. The waveform is accurate to 1.5 post-Newtonian order [O((v/c)3)] beyond the leading-order tensor gravitational waves (the "Newtonian quadrupole"). To solve the scalar-tensor field equations, we adapt the direct integration of the relaxed Einstein equations formalism developed by Will, Wiseman, and Pati. The internal gravity of the compact objects is treated with an approach developed by Eardley. We find that the scalar waves are described by the same small set of parameters which describes the equations of motion and tensor waves. For black hole-black hole binaries, the scalar waveform vanishes, as expected from previous results which show that these systems in scalar-tensor theory are indistinguishable from their general relativistic counterparts. For black hole-neutron star binaries, the scalar waveform simplifies considerably from the generic case, essentially depending on only a single parameter up to first post-Newtonian order. With both the tensor and scalar waveforms in hand, we calculate the total energy flux carried by the outgoing waves. This quantity is computed to first post-Newtonian order relative to the "quadrupole formula" and agrees with previous, lower order calculations. Â© 2015 American Physical Society.
