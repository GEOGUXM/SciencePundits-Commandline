Black phosphorus (BP) has been recently unveiled as a promising 2D direct bandgap semiconducting material. Here, ambipolar field-effect transistor behavior of nanolayers of BP with ferromagnetic tunnel contacts is reported. Using TiO<inf>2</inf>/Co contacts, a reduced Schottky barrier <50 meV, which can be tuned further by the gate voltage, is obtained. Eminently, a good transistor performance is achieved in the devices discussed here, with drain current modulation of four to six orders of magnitude and a mobility of μ<inf>h</inf> ≈ 155 cm2 V-1 s-1 for hole conduction at room temperature. Magnetoresistance calculations using a spin diffusion model reveal that the source-drain contact resistances in the BP device can be tuned by gate voltage to an optimal range for injection and detection of spin-polarized holes. The results of the study demonstrate the prospect of BP nanolayers for efficient nanoelectronic and spintronic devices. Field-effect transistors of nanolayer black phosphorus with ferromagnetic tunnel contacts are fabricated to explore their spintronic potential. The Schottky barrier is found to decrease dramatically with the introduction of a tunnel barrier layer of titanium dioxide. Magnetoresistance calculations validate that the contact resistances in such devices are in the appropriate range for spintronic applications. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
