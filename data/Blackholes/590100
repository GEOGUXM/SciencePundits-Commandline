The effects of non-Gaussianity on the constraints on the primordial curvature perturbation power spectrum from primordial black holes (PBHs) are considered. We extend previous analyses to include the effects of coupling between the modes of the horizon scale at the time the PBH forms and superhorizon modes. We consider terms of up to third order in the Gaussian perturbation. For the weakest constraints on the abundance of PBHs in the early universe (corresponding to a fractional energy density of PBHs of 10-5 at the time of formation), in the case of Gaussian perturbations, constraints on the power spectrum are Pζ<0.05 but can be significantly tighter when even a small amount of non-Gaussianity is considered, to Pζ<0.01, and become approximately Pζ<0.003 in more special cases. Surprisingly, even when there is negative skew (which naively would suggest fewer areas of high density, leading to weaker constraints), we find that the constraints on the power spectrum become tighter than the purely Gaussian case - in strong contrast with previous results. We find that the constraints are highly sensitive to both the non-Gaussianity parameters as well as the amplitude of superhorizon perturbations. © 2015 American Physical Society.
