We study scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational test fields in the Hayward, Bardeen, and Ayón-Beato-García regular black hole spacetimes and demonstrate that the test fields are stable in all of these spacetimes. Using the sixth order WKB approximation of the linear "axial" perturbative scheme, we determine dependence of the quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies on the characteristic parameters of the test fields and the spacetime charge parameters of the regular black holes. We give also the grey body factors, namely, the transmission and reflection coefficients of scattered scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational waves. We show that the damping of the quasinormal modes in regular black hole spacetimes is suppressed compared to the case of Schwarzschild black holes, and increasing the charge parameter of the regular black holes increases reflection and decreases the transmission factor of the incident waves for each of the test fields. © 2015 American Physical Society.
