In this paper, using the generalized Dirac equation which is modified by GUP, we study the fermion tunneling from 2 + 1 dimensional black string. Our results show that the Hawking temperature is not only depended on the event horizon of black string but also related to the quantum number of emitted fermion (energy and mass). Meanwhile, we find the GUP can slow down the Hawking temperature increase and lead to the remnants. It implies that the GUP can avoid the evaporation of black holes.
