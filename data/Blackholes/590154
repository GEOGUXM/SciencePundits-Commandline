The dynamics of string fluctuations under a rotating Bañados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole is studied using the method developed in Son and Teaney [J. High Energy Phys. 07 (2009) 021]. We compare our result with the one computed previously in Atmaja [J. High Energy Phys. 02 (2013) 021], using a different method as developed in de Boer et al. [J. High Energy Phys. 07 (2009) 094] for the case of a corotating string. The result supports the claim made in Atmaja [J. High Energy Phys. 02 (2013) 021] that the end of the string, which is identified as an external quark at the boundary, behaves as a Brownian particle with the mass is given by an effective mass parameter Meff equals to the zero-temperature mass of an external quark M0 times the cube of a Lorentz factor γ. Furthermore, we extend the computation to a higher dimensional rotating AdS black hole, where the metric is effectively asymptotic to AdS3 and the fluctuation is taken only along the corotating motion. It turns out that the effective mass of the external quark has a universal form of Meff=γ3M0. © 2015 American Physical Society.
