Abstract: We consider asymptotically Warped AdS<inf>3</inf> black holes in Topologically Massive Gravity. We study their thermodynamic stability and show the existence of a Hawking-Page phase transition between the black hole and thermal background phases. At zero angular potential, the latter is shown to occur at the self-dual point of the dual Warped Conformal Field Theory partition function, in analogy with the phase transition for BTZ black holes in AdS<inf>3</inf>/CFT<inf>2</inf>. We also discuss how the central and vacuum charges can be obtained from inner horizon mechanics in the presence of a gravitational anomaly. Â© 2015, The Author(s).
