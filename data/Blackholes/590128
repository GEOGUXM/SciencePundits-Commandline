Observational consequences of tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can enable us to discover quiescent SMBHs, constrain their mass function, and study the formation and evolution of transient accretion disks and jet formation. A couple of jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been recently claimed in hard X-rays, challenging jet models, which were previously applied to γ-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. It is therefore of paramount importance to increase the current sample. In this paper, we find that the best strategy is not to use upcoming X-ray instruments alone, which will yield between several (eRosita) and a couple of hundred (Einstein Probe) events per year below redshift one. We rather claim that a more efficient TDE hunter will be the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) operating in survey mode at 1.4 GHz. It may detect up to several hundred events per year below z ∼ 2.5 with a peak rate of a few tens per year at z ≈ 0.5. Therefore, even if the jet production efficiency is not 100% as assumed here, the predicted rates should be large enough to allow for statistical studies. The characteristic TDE decay of , however, is not seen in radio, whose flux emission is quite featureless. Identification therefore requires localization and prompt repointing by higher energy instruments. If radio candidates would be repointed within a day by future X-ray observatories (e.g., Athena- and LOFT-like missions), it will be possible to detect up to ≈400 X-ray counterparts, almost up to redshift 2. The shortcoming is that only for redshift below ≈0.4 will the trigger times be less than 10 days from the explosion. In this regard the X-ray surveys are better suited to probe the beginning of the flare, and are therefore complementary to SKA. © 2015. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.
