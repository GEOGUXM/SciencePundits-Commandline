In this paper we extend the investigation of Adami and Ver Steeg (2014 Class. Quantum Grav. 31 075015) to treat the process of black hole (BH) particle emission effectively as the analogous quantum optical process of parametric down conversion with a dynamical (depleted versus non-depleted) 'pump' source mode which models the evaporating BH energy degree of freedom. We investigate both the short time (non-depleted pump) and long time (depleted pump) regimes of the quantum state and its impact on the Holevo channel capacity for commu.nicating information from the far past to the far future in the presence of Hawking radiation. The new feature introduced in this work is the coupling of the emitted Hawking radiation modes through the common BH 'source pump' mode which phenomenologically represents a quantized energy degree of freedom of the gravitational field. This (zero-dimensional) model serves as a simplified arena to explore BH particle production/evaporation and back-action effects under an explicitly unitary evolution that enforces quantized energy/particle conservation. Within our analogous quantum optical model we examine the entanglement between two emitted particle/anti-particle and anti-particle/particle pairs coupled via the BH evaporating 'pump' source. We also analytically and dynamically verify the 'Page information time' for our model, which refers to the conventionally held belief that the information in the BH radiation becomes significant after the BH has evaporated half its initial energy into the outgoing radiation. Lastly, we investigate the effect of BH particle production/evaporation on two modes in the exterior region of the BH event horizon that are initially maximally entangled, when one mode falls inward and interacts with the BH, and the other remains forever outside and non-interacting.
