We explore the connections between various coordinate systems associated with observers moving inwardly along radial geodesics in the Schwarzschild geometry. Painlevé–Gullstrand (PG) time is adapted to freely falling observers dropped from rest from infinity; Lake–Martel–Poisson (LMP) time coordinates are adapted to observers who start at infinity with non-zero initial inward velocity; Gautreau–Hoffmann time coordinates are adapted to observers dropped from rest from a finite distance from the black hole horizon. We construct from these an LMP family and a proper-time family of time coordinates, the intersection of which is PG time. We demonstrate that these coordinate families are distinct, but related, one-parameter generalizations of PG time, and show linkage to Lemaître coordinates as well. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.
