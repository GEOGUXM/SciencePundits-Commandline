In this paper, we use previously developed exact solutions to present some of the curious features of a force-free magnetosphere in a Kerr background. More precisely, we obtain a hitherto unseen timelike current in the force-free magnetosphere that does not flow along a geodesic. The electromagnetic field in this case happens to be magnetically dominated. Changing the sign of a single parameter in our solutions generates a spacelike current that creates an electromagnetic field that is electrically dominated.
