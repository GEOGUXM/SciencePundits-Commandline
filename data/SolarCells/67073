In this work, we report a novel carbon based TiO<inf>2</inf> nanocomposite electron injection layer (photoanode) toward the improved performance of DSSCs. Graphitic carbon nanospheres (GCNSs) were synthesized by a unique acidic treatment of multi-wall carbon nanotubes. GCNS-TiO<inf>2</inf> nanocomposites with different concentrations of GCNSs (ranging from 5 to 20 μL) were prepared to use as photoanodes in DSSCs. Structural and morphological properties of GCNS-TiO<inf>2</inf> nanocomposites were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and ultra-high resolution transmission electron microscopy techniques, respectively. A systematic increment in the short circuit current density (J<inf>SC</inf>) and open circuit voltage (V<inf>OC</inf>) of DSSC was observed by increasing GCNS concentration up to an optimal value, possibly due to the combined effect of slight rise in quasi-Fermi level and higher carrier transport rate in the resultant composite. Thus, a significant enhancement of ∼47% in the efficiency of DSSC containing GCNS-TiO<inf>2</inf> photoanode was observed as compare to DSSC with pure TiO<inf>2</inf> photoanode. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
