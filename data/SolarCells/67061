This study proposed a mood lighting design, which comprises of several groups of light emitting elements, a controller, an optical filter, a diffuser, and solar cells. It is capable of irradiating yellow light, red light, and infrared (IR) light. This new algorithm can allow the lamp to imitate sunlight, thus presenting sunrise or sunset processes over time. The microcomputer control unit is set inside the base body and connected with each of the first emission elements and each of the second emission elements. The emission model of each emission element is controlled through a timing control governor set inside the microcomputer control unit. In this manner, this study achieves the goal of making the lamp emit lifelike imitations sunset or sunrise lights, and can change the color of the emitted light with time. Moreover, the system makes the users feel as if they are in the situation of a vivid sunset or sunrise. With the calculations of two different accumulative errors, the sunrise/sunset database provides a series of electronically adjustable time intervals and tracks in the color space to reappear as the most beautiful moment of sunrise/sunset, at sometime and somewhere.
