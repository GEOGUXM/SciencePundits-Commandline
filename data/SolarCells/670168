An improvement in the efficiency of Ixora (. Ixora sp. (Rubiaceae)) floral dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has been achieved by diminishing the pigment's interactions. Liquid column chromatography (LCC) separated the dye components, namely aurone, pelargonidin, and derivatives of cyanidin & malvidin, showed improved photovoltaic performance when compared to cells sensitized by the original dye extract of Ixora. The LCC separated dye components were analyzed using UV-Vis, fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic studies. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and band gaps of the dyes were investigated. The DSSC prepared with the LCC separated dye showed energy conversion efficiencies (ECEs) ranging from 0.203% to 0.951%, whereas the original Ixora dye sensitized cell showed an ECE of 0.381%. Transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to elucidate the photovoltaic parameters. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
