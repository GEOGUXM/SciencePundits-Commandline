Hierarchical TiO<inf>2</inf> nanorod-sheet-flowers (TNRSFs) consisting of one dimensional (1D) vertically aligned rutile TiO<inf>2</inf> nanorods array (TNRA), 2D TiO<inf>2</inf> nanosheets (TNSs) and 3D TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoflowers (TNFs) have been synthesized via a simple NaOH-assisted hydrothermal method and employed as an photoanode for high-efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In our strategy, The TNFs layer with large thickness can potentially enable a great amount of dye adsorption and significantly strengthen the light-harvesting ability, which is beneficial for generating more charge. In addition, The TNRA and TNSs act like charge collectors, providing efficient transport pathways for electrons, which means the photogenerated charge can be collected efficiently through this conducting network. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement shows that the TNRSF film possesses better electron transport ability and longer electron lifetime (28.4 ms) compared with the TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticals (TNPs) film. Furthermore, an overall power conversion efficiency of 8.41% (with a J<inf>sc</inf> of 16.95 mA cm-2, V<inf>oc</inf> of 0.73 V and FF of 68%) is achieved for the DSSC based on the TNRSF photoanode, indicating a 51.8% enhancement compared with that of the TNPs photoanode (5.54%). The discoveries from this work highlight the significance of designing photoanode materials with hierarchical structures for enhanced photovoltaic performance. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
