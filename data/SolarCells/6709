CdTe is the best suited semiconductor for solar cells due to its band gap value 1.47 eV which is close to solar spectrum, low sublimation temperature and high absorption coefficient in the range of solar spectrum. To improve the photovoltaic performance of CdS/CdTe thin film solar cells, the CdS window layer is alloyed with different concentration of ZnS to reduce the resistivity and increase the band gap values. The single crystal CdTe based solar cell devices were prepared by vacuum evaporation method and have undergone for different temperature at various illumination levels to enhance the cell efficiency. We have achieved 14.37% efficiency and increased short circuit current density and open circuit voltage by reducing series resistance of the cell. Â© 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
