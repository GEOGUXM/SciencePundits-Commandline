The InAs/GaAs quantum dots structure embedded in GaInP/Ga(In)As/Ge triple junction solar cell with and without Ga0.90In0.10As strain reducing layer was investigated. Conversion efficiency of 33.91% at 1,000 suns AM 1.5D with Ga0.90In0.10As strain reducing layer was demonstrated. A 1.19% improvement of the conversion efficiency was obtained via inserting the Ga0.90In0.10As strain reducing layer. The main contribution of this improvement was from the increase of the short-circuit current, which is caused by the reduction of the Shockley–Read–Hall recombination centers. Consequently, there was a decrease in open circuit voltage due to the lower thermal activation energy of confined carriers in Ga0.9In0.1As than GaAs and a reduction in the effective band gap of quantum dots. © 2015, Li et al.; licensee Springer.
