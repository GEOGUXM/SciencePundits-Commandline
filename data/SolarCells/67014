Abstract The photovoltaic output of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are greatly dependent on the amount of absorbed photons, which is limited by the thickness of active layer of DSSCs and the illumination conditions. To improve the cell performance under low irradiance condition, a photoanode was designed by attaching a TiO<inf>2</inf> nanotube photonic crystal (NTPC) onto the thin TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticle (NP) layer for applications in thin and semi-transparent DSSCs. It is found that the introduction of the TiO<inf>2</inf> NTPC significantly increases the light harvesting and hence the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the respective DSSCs. The TiO<inf>2</inf> NTPC provides multi-functionalities, such as Bragg reflection, light scatting and additional light harvesting from its nanotube structure, leading to more significant light harvesting enhancement in these thin and semi-transparent DSSCs. Compared with the single-layer TiO<inf>2</inf> NP based reference DSSCs, the above-mentioned synergic effects in a cell incoporated with a ∼2.3-μm-thick TiO<inf>2</inf> NTPC yield PCE enhancements up to 99.1% and 130%, under 1 and 0.5 Sun conditions, respectively. Meanwhile, an obvious compensation effect of TiO<inf>2</inf> NTPC to reduce the output power drop of these cells under tilted incient light is also demonstrated. The work will boost the practical applications of PC in irradiance sensitive devices. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
