The highly crystalline mesoporous B/N co-doped TiO<inf>2</inf> nanomaterial is successfully synthetized using a facile process. A modified polysulfide redox couple, (CH<inf>3</inf>)<inf>4</inf>N)<inf>2</inf>S/((CH<inf>3</inf>)<inf>4</inf>N)<inf>2</inf>S<inf>n</inf>, was employed in CdS quantum dots (QDs) sensitized B/N co-doped TiO<inf>2</inf> solar cell with ZnS passivation layers and NiS as counter electrode, followed by chemical bath deposition (CBD) in an organic solution to prepare the QDs-cell to ensure high wettability and superior penetration ability of the B/N co-doped TiO<inf>2</inf> films, then obtained an open-circuit photovoltage of 1.23 V, a high ff of 89%, a short-circuit photocurrent (J<inf>sc</inf>) of 4.46 mA cm-2, and yielding a high overall energy conversion of 4.88%.
