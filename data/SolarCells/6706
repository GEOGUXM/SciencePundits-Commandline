ZnO/Zn<inf>x</inf>Cd<inf>1-x</inf>Se coaxial nanowires (NWs) have been successfully synthesized by combining chemical vapor deposition with a facile alternant physical deposition method. The shell composition x can be precisely tuned in the whole region (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) by adjusting growth time ratio of ZnSe to CdSe. As a result, the effective bandgaps of coaxial nanowires were conveniently modified from 1.85 eV to 2.58 eV, almost covering the entire visible spectrum. It was also found that annealing treatment was in favor of forming the mixed crystal and improving crystal quality. An optimal temperature of 350°C was obtained according to our experimental results. Additionally, time resolved photo-luminescence spectra revealed the longest carrier lifetime in ZnO/CdSe coaxial nanowires. As a result, the ZnO/CdSe nanowire cell acquired the maximal conversion efficiency of 2.01%. This work shall pave a way towards facile synthesis of ternary alloys for photovoltaic applications. © 2015, Luo et al.; licensee Springer.
