Abstract Liquid phase crystallization of silicon is a promising technology to grow crystalline silicon thin films on glass. It has already been demonstrated that open circuit voltages of up to 656 mV and efficiencies of up to 11.8% can be achieved by this technique. Nevertheless further improvements are required to become competitive with wafer based silicon solar cells. A possibility to improve the quality is to enlarge the grain size and to control the crystallographic orientation of the resulting layers. While a preferential {100} surface orientation can be triggered utilizing suitable crystallization parameters, the in-plane orientation still remains random. Also the grain size stays within the same range. By introducing a local monocrystalline seed at the beginning of the crystallization process, we are able to control both the surface and the in-plane orientation of the silicon films. In addition the grain size is significantly increased in scanning direction and only limited by the substrate size of 5 cm. This high morphological quality is accompanied by an improved electrical quality confirmed by photoluminescence imaging and Hall measurements. This is a big step towards the final goal to directly grow monocrystalline silicon thin films on glass substrates. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
