A unique bias-dependent phenomenon in CH<inf>3</inf>NH<inf>3</inf>PbI<inf>3-</inf><inf>x</inf>Cl<inf>x</inf> based planar perovskite solar cells has been demonstrated, in which the photovoltaic parameters derived from the current-voltage (I-V) curves are highly dependent on the initial positive bias of the I-V measurement. In FTO/CH<inf>3</inf>NH<inf>3</inf>PbI<inf>3-</inf><inf>x</inf>Cl<inf>x</inf>/Au devices, the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current increased by ca. 337.5% and 281.9% respectively, by simply increasing the initial bias from 0.5V to 2.5V.
