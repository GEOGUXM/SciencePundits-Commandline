This work presents the optimal deposition parameters for TiO<inf>2</inf> compact layers and low cost Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> = 97wt%:3wt%, AZO) transparent conducting films, using radio frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering to improve the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The structure, morphology and photocatalytic performance of the TiO<inf>2</inf> compact layer (blocking layer) and the effect of AZO films on the DSSC's conversion efficiency are studied. The grey-based Taguchi method is used to determine the processing parameters for the deposition of the TiO<inf>2</inf> compact layer (rf power, substrate temperature, O<inf>2</inf>/(Ar+O<inf>2</inf>) flow ratios and sputtering pressure) by considering multiple performance characteristics. These films are analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy. The results show that the TiO<inf>2</inf> compact layer prevents charge recombination, which results in a greater short-circuit photocurrent density. The intensity of the X-ray peaks for the AZO films also increases with annealing treatment, which gives improved crystallinity for the films. This study further determines the effect of the AZO annealing temperature on cell conversion efficiency. If the AZO is annealed at 500°C and the TiO<inf>2</inf> porous layer is sintered at 450°C with a holding time of 30 min, the experimental results demonstrate that the efficiency of the DSSCs with TiO<inf>2</inf> compact layer are increased from 2.24 to 5.69%. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
