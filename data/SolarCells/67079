In this paper, Co<inf>0.85</inf>Se hollow nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized by a one-step solvothermal method. The Co<inf>0.85</inf>Se counter electrode (Co<inf>0.85</inf>Se CE) has been fabricated and used for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The electrocatalytic activity of CEs has been characterized by cyclic voltammetry, Tafel-polarization curves, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results indicate that Co<inf>0.85</inf>Se CE with a large surface area shows the high electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3-. The power conversion efficiency of the DSSC based on Co<inf>0.85</inf>Se CE is obtained up to 6.03%, which is slightly lower than that of the DSSC based on Pt CE (6.45%). Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
