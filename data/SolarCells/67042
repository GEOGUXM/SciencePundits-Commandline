Abstract Anatase TiO<inf>2</inf> film with 3D network nanoporous structure consisted of 1D nanowires is obtained on SnO<inf>2</inf>:F (FTO) glass substrate by in-situ hydrothermal synthesis and applied in mesoporous perovskite (CH<inf>3</inf>NH<inf>3</inf>PbI<inf>3</inf>) solar cell. A thin Ti film is deposited on FTO substrate by magnetron sputtering before the hydrothermal treatment with sodium hydroxide solution. Then, a layer of network nanoporous TiO<inf>2</inf> (NT) film is formed. The efficiency of perovskite solar cell based on this 3D structure with one-step sintering can be optimized to 9.19%. The NT film consisted of 1D TiO<inf>2</inf> nanowires is beneficial to the transmission of charge carriers and the infiltration of hole transport material. And this one-step sintering process can reduce the interface defects and enhance the fill factor of the device. Then, we further optimize the surface of NT layer through TiCl<inf>4</inf> post-treatment. The post-treatment can optimize the carrier separation and the deposition of perovskite layer, thus improving the open-circuit voltage (V<inf>oc</inf>) and short-circuit current density (J<inf>sc</inf>) of perovskite solar cell. As a result, the value of J<inf>sc</inf> gets an enhancement of 45.63% and the efficiency of perovskite solar cell reaches up to 12.78%. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
