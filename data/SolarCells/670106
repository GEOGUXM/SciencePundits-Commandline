Polymer plates containing fluorescent dyes with photovoltaic cells attached to one or more edges have the potential to be used for solar light collection in the built environment. The heating of the polymer plates and the resulting effects this may have on the operating temperatures of the attached photovoltaic cells and the integrity of the cells are studied. The results indicate that the luminescent solar concentrator under a solar simulator will allow the edge attached photovoltaic cells to operate up to 10°C cooler compared to cells experiencing direct solar exposure because of the avoidance of infrared light. We also demonstrate the importance of correct adhesive to avoid rupture of the attached cell. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
