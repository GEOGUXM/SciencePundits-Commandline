The photogalvanic cells based on Naphthol Green B sensitizer-Fructose reductant-Sodium Lauryl Sulphate surfactant has been studied in natural sunlight. The cell has been found workable in natural sunlight with greatly enhanced optimum cell performance. The 1159.2 μW power, 4500 μA short-circuit current, 1070 mV open-circuit potential, 14.49% efficiency and 240 min storage capacity (as half change time) has been observed in optimum cell fabrication conditions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
