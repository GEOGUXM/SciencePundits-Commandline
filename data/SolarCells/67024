In this work, CuInS<inf>2</inf>/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) layers are fabricated by the sol-gel spin-coating method. We introduce two forms of MWCNTs into a CIS<inf>2</inf> solution, washed functional multiwalled carbon nanotubes (W-FMWCNTs) and unwashed-functional multiwalled carbon nanotubes (UW-FMWCNTs), in order to investigate the effects of MWCNTs and an acidic environment on the physical properties of the CIS<inf>2</inf> absorber layers. The structure and morphology of the samples are investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), respectively. The XRD study shows that all samples crystallize in a tetragonal structure. The results obtained from the optical, thermo-electric, and electrical measurements indicate that the two groups of CIS<inf>2</inf> layers prepared using W- and UW-FMWCNTs show the opposite behaviors. The Seebeck coefficient (SC) measurements indicate possible formation of a p-n junction. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
