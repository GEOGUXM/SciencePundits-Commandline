Titanium dioxide is an excellent photocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen production but its application is limited by its poor visible light harvesting capability. In this work, a visible-light-responsive photocatalytic hydrogen production system was developed using Zn(II)-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (ZnTCPP) sensitized MoS<inf>2</inf>/TiO<inf>2</inf> (ZnTCPP-MoS<inf>2</inf>/TiO<inf>2</inf>) as photocatalysts. The as-prepared composite photocatalysts have apparent adsorption in visible light region, making them active for visible-light-induced hydrogen evolution. Even without noble metals, ZnTCPP-MoS<inf>2</inf>/TiO<inf>2</inf> photocatalyst loaded with 1.00wt% MoS<inf>2</inf> shows the highest H<inf>2</inf> production rate of 10.2μmolh-1, and the turnover number (TON) with respect to ZnTCPP dye reaches 261 after visible light irradiation for 12h. The highest H<inf>2</inf> production rate of ZnTCPP-MoS<inf>2</inf>/TiO<inf>2</inf> is much higher than that of ZnTCPP-Pt/TiO<inf>2</inf>, suggesting that MoS<inf>2</inf> can act as a more effective cocatalyst than the commonly used platinum. This study presents a noble-metal-free and visible-light-responsive TiO<inf>2</inf>-based photocatalyst for solar-to-hydrogen conversion. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
