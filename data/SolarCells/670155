We synthesized two new, air-stable and environmentally friendly polyazomethines and characterized their photovoltaic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic properties. Two polyazomethines with one (25Th-DMB) or three (2252Th-DMB) thiophene rings were synthesized and tested as donors in the active layer in solar cells. The investigated polymer solar cells contained different amounts of PCBM and PC<inf>71</inf>BM. The bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells were fabricated and studied, considering the architecture of the devices (i.e., LiF, TiO<inf>2</inf>, and TiO<inf>2</inf>:Ag) and the fabrication conditions (i.e., air, inert gas, and annealing). The highest power conversion efficiency, which was equal to 0.52% under simulated 100mW/cm2 AM 1.5G irradiation, was determined for the device using polyazomethine with three thiophene rings and PC<inf>71</inf>BM created in air with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS (100 cP)/2252Th-DMB:PC<inf>71</inf>BM (1:2)/Al architecture. In addition, the power conversion efficiency was strongly dependent on the viscosity of the PEDOT:PSS used. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
