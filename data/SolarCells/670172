Surfactant free nanocrystals (NCs) of lead sulfide (PbS) prepared using Continuous Spray Pyrolysis (CoSP) technique had been dispersed in poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and used in hybrid polymer solar cells (HSCs) to study the role of surfactant free NCs in these devices. Absence of surfactant on PbS NCs improves the polymer-NCs interface and is responsible for an efficient electronic interaction between the two materials. FTIR results show a shift in the characteristics band for the blends confirming the proper bonding between the polymer and NCs. Hybrid polymer solar cells with configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PbS/Al have been fabricated with different PbS loading. With the increase in PbS NC content, the device efficiency increases first and then decreases, the device having 30 wt% of PbS NCs shows the best performance with an energy conversion efficiency of 1.6%, an open circuit voltage of 0.42 V, a short-circuit current density of 9.90 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 0.40 under Air Mass 1.5G illumination with the irradiation of 100 mW/cm2. Structural and morphological investigations show that better performance is achieved with the optimum amount of PbS NCs due to good distribution and interconnection in the polymer layer.
