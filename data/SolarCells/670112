A series of TiO<inf>2</inf>-graphene stacked photoanodes for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were fabricated by electrospray (E-spray) deposition. Among devices incorporating single graphene layer with different deposition times, device with 1 min graphene deposition gave the best performance. For multi-graphene-layer involved devices, best result was obtained with 3 layers of graphene. The working principles were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, transmittance spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and incident-photo-conversion efficiency data. We found that although graphene layers incorporated in TiO<inf>2</inf> photoanode slightly decreased dye adsorption, they were able to significantly improve the electron transport, and the charge recombination at the interfaces of TiO<inf>2</inf>/dye and TiO<inf>2</inf>/electrolyte were greatly suppressed, leading to dramatic improvement in power conversion efficiency. When inserting three layers of pure graphene into the TiO<inf>2</inf> photoanode, high efficiency of 8.9% was obtained, constituting an over 23.6% improvement. Further increasing graphene layers to five, although electron lifetimes is the longest, both the largest charge transfer resistance and the least amount of the dye loading lead to the lowest device efficiency. Our work demonstrated, that pure graphene layer can be successfully incorporated into TiO<inf>2</inf> photoanode by E-spray method with easiness of thickness control and the photoanode with graphene/TiO<inf>2</inf> alternatively layered structure is an excellent candidate for DSSCs.
