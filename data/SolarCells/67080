A transparent nickel selenide (Ni<inf>0.85</inf>Se) is prepared by a facile solvothermal reaction and used as an efficient Pt-free counter electrode (CE) for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Field emission scanning electron microscopy observes that the as-prepared Ni<inf>0.85</inf>Se possesses porous structure. Cyclic voltammogram measurement indicates that Ni<inf>0.85</inf>Se electrode has larger current density than Pt electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy shows that the Ni<inf>0.85</inf>Se electrode has lower charge-transfer resistance than Pt electrode. Under simulated solar light irradiation with intensity of 100 mW cm-2 (AM 1.5), the DSSC based on the Ni<inf>0.85</inf>Se CE achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.88%, which is higher than the solar cell based on Pt CE (8.13%). Based on the transparency of Ni<inf>0.85</inf>Se, the DSSC with Ni<inf>0.85</inf>Se/mirror achieves a PCE of 10.19%. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
