Abstract Single-phase grid-connected converters (GCCs) are widely used to connect small-scale distributed renewable resources to the grid. However, unlike a three-phase system, design of the vector control for a single-phase GCC is more challenging. This paper presents a novel vector control design for a single-phase GCC based on a direct current vector control method. The design of the proposed vector controllers considered different filtering schemes, including L, LC and LCL filters. The behavior of the proposed direct current vector control is investigated through both simulation and hardware experimentation. Both demonstrate that the proposed control approach has strong ability to trace rapidly changing reference commands, tolerate system disturbances, and satisfy various control needs of single-phase GCCs under different filtering configurations.
