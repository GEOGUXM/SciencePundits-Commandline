Abstract We report a novel hydrothermal route for the synthesis of Cu<inf>2</inf>NiSnS<inf>4</inf> (CNTS) nanoparticles. Structural characterization was done by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which confirmed the phase and crystallinity. Additional characterization was done by Raman spectroscopy, Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and UV-vis spectrophotometry. The band-gap of 1.56 eV and photo response behavior indicates that CNTS is ideal for application in thin film solar cell devices. Thermoelectric study of CNTS is carried out for the first time. Thermoelectric power factor (P) attains the value of 603×10-6 μW m-1 K-2 at 440 K. The value of activation energy is found to be 160 meV. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
