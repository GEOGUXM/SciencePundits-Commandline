Electrocoagulation (EC) treatment of 100mg/L synthetic wastewater (SWW) containing humic acids was optimized (achieving 90% COD<inf>Mn</inf> and 80% DOC removal efficiencies), after which real peat bog drainage waters (PBDWs) from three northern Finnish peat bogs were also treated. High pollutant removal efficiencies were achieved: P<inf>tot</inf>, TS, and color could be removed completely, while N<inf>tot</inf>, COD<inf>Mn</inf>, and DOC/TOC removal efficiencies were in the range of 33-41%, 75-90%, and 62-75%, respectively. Al and Fe performed similarly as the anode material.Large scale experiments (1m3) using cold (T=10-11°C) PBDWs were also conducted successfully, with optimal treatment times of 60-120min (applying current densities of 60-75 A/m2). Residual values of Al and Fe (complete removal) were lower than their initial values in the EC-treated PBDWs.Electricity consumption and operational costs in optimum conditions were found to be low and similar for all the waters studied: 0.94 kWh/m3 and 0.15 €/m3 for SWW and 0.35-0.70 kWh/m3 and 0.06-0.12 €/m3 for the PBDWs (large-scale). Thus, e.g. solar cells could be considered as a power source for this EC application. In conclusion, EC treatment of PBDW containing humic substances was shown to be feasible. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
