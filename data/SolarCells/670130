PbS thin films composed of highly (200)-oriented shuttle-like nano-/micro-rods were successfully fabricated on glass substrates by the environment friendly ionothermal method at 140 °C in deep eutectic solvent (DES). The as-prepared products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, respectively. The possible mechanism of the oriented growth of PbS nano-/micro-rods was discussed. The PbS thin films composed of shuttle-like nano-/micro-rods exhibited a large absorbance property in the wavelength range of 350-1100 nm, and moreover, the PL spectrum had a broad emission band centered at 490 nm. The shuttle-like PbS nano-/micro-rods-based thin films might have potential application in solar cells. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
