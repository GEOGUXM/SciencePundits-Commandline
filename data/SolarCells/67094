Graphene oxide (GO) is widely used as an interfacial material in applications such as organic light emitting diodes and photovoltaic devices. Herein we report a layer-by-layer (LbL) assembled GO thin film as an anode interfacial layer (AIL) for efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs). The GO thin film is fabricated by alternately depositing cationic polyelectrolyte poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and GO on ITO/glass substrate, which possesses controllable thickness by adjusting LbL deposition frequency. The presence of ultrathin GO films improves the work function of ITO, leading to a better contact between the active layer and ITO anode. With the optimized number of deposition times, the efficiency of 6.04% for the PSC with PDDA-GO bilayer (GO-2) as the AIL was achieved. Â© 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.
