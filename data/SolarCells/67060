Two novel acceptor pended push-pull conjugated polymers PTT-DTBT and PT-DTTBT, incorporating thieno[3,2-b] thiophene in the backbone chain and conjugated side chains respectively, were designed and synthesized. The effects of the location of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units on the thermal, photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated. Compared to the polymer PTT-DTBT, the polymer PT-DTTBT with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units in the side chains shows more broadened and red-shifted absorption, smaller band gap and higher hole mobility. Bulk heterojunction solar cells with the polymers as electron donors and (6,6)-phenyl-C<inf>61</inf>-butyric acidmethyl ester as the electron acceptor were fabricated, and the PT-DTTBT-based device exhibits a higher power conversion efficiency of 4.07% than that of the PTT-DTBT-based device (3.05%) without any processing additives or posttreatments.
