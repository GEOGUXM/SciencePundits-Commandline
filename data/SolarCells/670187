Morphology tailored TiO<inf>2</inf> nano assemblies consisting of nanorods with and without nanoparticle attachments were hydrothermally synthesized and their characteristics and light scattering properties were determined by x-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen sorption analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis). The nanorod-nanoparticles (NR-NP) assemblies and smooth nanorod (NR) double layers were screen printed onto fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass underlayers to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) photoanodes. The double layer heterogeneous hierarchical NR-NP decoration had wide Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) area which resulted in 45.1% dye loading capacity, 18.96 mA cm-2 photocurrent and average photoanode efficiency of 8.07% which was 21% greater than NRs photoanode efficiency. Distinct NR-NPs morphology indicated multiple wave trapping and strong light scattering which was as high as 89.2%. Improvements in NR-NPs DSSCs performance were obtained because of lower resistance to charge transfer (10.07 Ω) and faster diffusion of electrolyte ions (1.22 Mho). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
