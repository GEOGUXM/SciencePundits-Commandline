The present paper involves the development of novel imidazole based non-planar, small size, highly soluble and thermally stable hole transporting material (HTM) namely 2-(1-(anthracen-2-yl)-4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl) phenol (TPAN) to improve the stability of dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The molecule has been investigated in solution and thin film form for their structural, photo physical and electrical properties by experimental as well as quantum chemical techniques. A solid state dye sensitized solar cell (SSDSSC) using this newly synthesised HTM has been fabricated and characterized for their photovoltaic performance under illumination. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
