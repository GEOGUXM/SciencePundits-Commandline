P-type Si substrate based solar cells were prepared with indium-tin-oxide thin films as the front top electrodes and Al layers as the rear ones. A synergetic effect of surface texture and field-effect passivations on improving Si solar cell performance was investigated. The surface texture was conducted by NaOH etching of Si, and field-effect passivations were performed by introducing SiO<inf>2</inf> and Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> thin film layers at the front and rear sides of the Si solar cell, respectively. The surface texture treatment makes the Si solar cell efficiency increase from 9.81% to 11.08%. After the synergetic treatments of surface texture and field-effect passivations, the efficiency further increased to 15.04%, that is, a more than 50% relative efficiency enhancement was obtained. This work demonstrates the significant effectiveness and facile applicability of the synergetic effect of surface texture and field-effect passivations on improving Si solar cell performance.
