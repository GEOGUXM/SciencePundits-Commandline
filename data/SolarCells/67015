Abstract The battery energy-storage industry is evolving rapidly so new battery components are needed with high stability and improved energy density, as well as enhanced safety. In this paper, results on new salts, safer degradation and good electrochemical performances are reported. Four organic anions for Li-salts were synthesized and their conductivity, viscosity and electrochemical potential window in EC/DEC (3/7) solutions were examined. These salts have high thermal stability and safer degradation products (compared to LiPF<inf>6</inf> and Li-TFSI), which were identified by TGA-MS. Cyclic voltammetry measurements showed their electrochemical window and oxidation limits were at least 4.3 and 4.5 V vs Li/Li+ using a platinum and high surface area carbon material working electrode, respectively. The salts passivated the common aluminum current collector at 4.4 V vs Li/Li+ and without corrosion. The properties of one Li salts were evaluated in half cell configuration as a model system using lithium iron phosphate (LFP), lithium titanate oxide (LTO) and graphite as electrodes. The performance of the salt showed promising behavior in the model system, compared to benchmark salts such as LiPF<inf>6</inf> and Li-TFSI. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
