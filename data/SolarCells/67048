A novel, solution-processable non-fullerene electron acceptor 9,9′-(5,5-dioctyl-5H-dibenzo [b,d]silole-3,7-diyl)bis(2,7-dioctyl-4-(octylamino)benzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone) (B3) based on dibenzosilole and naphthalenediimide building blocks was designed, synthesized, characterized and successfully used in a bulk-heterojunction organic solar cell. B3 displayed excellent solubility, thermal stability and acquired electron energy levels matching with those of archetypal donor polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene). Solution-processable bulk-heterojunction devices afforded 1.16% power conversion efficiency with a high fill factor of 53%. B3 is the first example in the literature using this design principle, where mild donor units at the peripheries of end-capped naphthalenediimide units tune solubility and optical energy levels simultaneously. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
