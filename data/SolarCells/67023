Abstract Photovoltaics (PV) and air source heat pump (ASHP) are very important techniques for energy conservation and carbon reduction. It is essential to master the completed design idea and thermodynamic analysis method for the integration of PV and ASHP. Then, a design idea depending on the biggest power load of building appliances for the PV system was proposed in this paper. The thermodynamic analysis method for the PV integrated ASHP system considering the building process of PV modules was also provided here. To show the idea and method, the feasibility and exergy performance of an integrated PV-ASHP system (ASHP system driven by AC power inverted from PV) for domestic residential applications in Central-south China was investigated. Exergy efficiency and exergy consumption cost of the household PV-ASHP system were modelled based on the max PV conversion efficiency. The analyses show adequate efficacy of the PV-ASHP system with good thermodynamic and economic performance for their application in Central-south China. The PV-ASHP integrated system would have the best performance if the installed capacity of the individual PV system was decided by the required rating power of the ASHP system for HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning). It could also be supported by the thermodynamic analysis results. The design idea and analysis method in this paper not only illustrate the potential and the validity of the integrated system in Central-south China but also would enable sustainable development and applying of solar energy and other renewable energy.
