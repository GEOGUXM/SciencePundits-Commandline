To improve solar conversion efficiency of transparent-conductive-oxide (TCO)-less Ti-electrode-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), plasma treatment improved the local root mean square surface roughness (RMS) of the Ti-electrodes and the adherence ability of TiO<inf>2</inf>. The solar conversion efficiency of the cell increased with the RMS of the Ti-electrodes. Pure Ti700-electrode-based DSSCs with RMS of 5.16 nm exhibited 4.30% solar conversion efficiency, slightly less than the 5.26% solar conversion efficiency of commercial fluorine-doped-tin-oxide (FTO)-based DSSCs with RMS of 25.60 nm. Ti700-P15-300 W electrode-based DSSCs with RMS of 18.85 nm showed 5.24% solar conversion efficiency. Ti700-P20-300 W electrode-based DSSCs with RMS of 22.57 nm showed the best solar conversion efficiency of 5.44%, a circuit photocurrent density of 13.58 mA cm-2, an open circuit voltage of 0.696 V, and fill factor of 57.60%. This cell improves upon the properties of a pure Ti700-electrode-based DSSCs by about 26.5%. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
