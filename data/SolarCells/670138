Abstract Cu2FeSnS4 (CFTS) thin film has been synthesized by rapid thermal annealing sulfurization of radio-frequency magnetron sputtered precursor. X-ray diffraction pattern indicates that all phases belong to CFTS with tetragonal structure. The strain which exists in the film is calculated to be 8.29×10-3 using the Williamson-Hall method. Raman spectrum and infrared reflectivity present two A1, two B and three E optical vibration modes. The band gap of CFTS is evaluated to be 1.42 eV by the transmission spectrum. The electrical properties of CFTS with the structure of glass/Mo/CFTS/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO have also been discussed. The open circuit voltage (Voc) is 110 mV, short circuit density (Jsc) is 2.5 mA cm-2 and fill factor (FF) is 26.3%. These results are helpful to the preparation and further study of CFTS thin films for the solar cell application. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
