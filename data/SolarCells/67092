[6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid-4′-hydroxyl-azobenzene ester (PCBAb) was synthesized and used as the acceptor in the fabrication of reversible UV-VIS response bi-state polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on the photoinduced cis-trans isomerization of PCBAb. The device can be switched between "active" and "sleep" by the irradiation of UV and visible light, respectively. The active device has a PCE of 2.0%. With UV irradiation, the device goes to "sleep" with a lowered PCE (0.4%), and simultaneously decreased Jsc, Voc and FF, while after visible light treatment, the device is made "active" again. The mechanism of the bi-state process involves the different electron mobilities of the isomers. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
