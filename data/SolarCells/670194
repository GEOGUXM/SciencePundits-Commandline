Abstract Here we report the preparation of dye-sensitized solar cells containing disperse red 1 (RD1)- or reactive red 2 (RR2)-modified nanoparticulate TiO<inf>2</inf> photoanodes and their charge carrier dynamics under visible light illumination. Photoelectrochemical data obtained for both devices indicated that the photoinduced charge generation process was significantly better for RR2-sensitized solar cells than for DR1-sensitized solar cells. The effectiveness of the photoinduced charge generation observed for the RR2-sensitized TiO<inf>2</inf> photoanodes was explained by invoking two complementary phenomena which can be promoted in the presence of the voluminous 1,3,5-triazine moieties of RR2: (a) delay of the increment of I<inf>3</inf>- ions concentration into the dyed-TiO<inf>2</inf> pores, due to their known capabilities for establishing charge transfer complexes between N atoms of the heterocyclic ring and I atoms of the electrolyte; and (b) reduction of the electron interception process, due to the reaction established between photogenerated electrons and I<inf>3</inf>- anions of the electrolyte.
