Abstract Three 2,2-dicyanovinyl (DCV) end-capped A-π-D-π-A type oligothiophenes (DCV-OTs) containing dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (DTSi), cyclopenta[1,2-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (DTCP) or dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTPy) unit as the central donor part, mono-thiophene as the π-conjugation bridge were synthesized. The absorption spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry of these compounds were characterized. Results showed that all these compounds have intensive absorption band over 500-680 nm with a LUMO energy level around -3.80 eV, which is slightly higher than that of [6,6]phenyl-C<inf>61</inf>-butyric acid methyl ester (PC<inf>61</inf>BM, E<inf>LUMO</inf> = -4.01 eV), but lower than that of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT, E<inf>LUMO</inf> = -2.91 eV). Solution processed bulk heterojunction "all-thiophene" solar cells using P3HT as electron donor and the above mentioned oligothiophenes as electron acceptor were fabricated and tested. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.31% was achieved for DTSi-cored compound DTSi(THDCV)<inf>2</inf>, whereas PTB7:DTSi(THDCV)<inf>2</inf> based device showed slightly higher PCE of 1.56%. Electron mobilities of these three compounds were measured to be around 10-5 cm2 V-1 s-1 by space charge limited current method, which is much lower than that of PC<inf>61</inf>BM, and was considered as one of the reason for the low photovoltaic performance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
