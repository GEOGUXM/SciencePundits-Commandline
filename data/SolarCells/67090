This paper reports the fabrication of c-Si based solar cells using spin-on dopants. Solar cells were developed by texturing both surfaces of the c-Si, and forming the p-n junction by spin-coating the n-type dopant followed by rapid thermal processing (RTP). For back surface field formation on the rear side, a similar spin-coating step was undertaken for one cell and e-beam Al deposition for the other. In the case of double-sided spin-coated cell, simultaneous p-n junction and back surface field were formed in one RTP cycle. Without using high performance features in the device, double-sided spin-on doped cell showed Voc of 600±0.01mV, Jsc of 33.1±0.03mA/cm2, FF of 74.26±0.06% and efficiency of 14.74%. As compared to single-sided spin-on doped cell, an improvement in efficiency of about 1.3% has been obtained which can be attributed to boron back surface field. Double-sided spin-on process significantly reduces thermal budget and improves throughput. Besides texturization, high efficiency features have not been used in the device. The results clearly demonstrate that c-Si based solar cells are potentially cost effective to manufacture. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
