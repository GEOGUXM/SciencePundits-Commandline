In this study, we systematically investigated the plasmonic effects of silver nanoplates (Ag NPLs) embedded in organic and perovskite (PVSK) photovoltaic (PV) cells. Optical properties of the Ag NPLs were manipulated by varying their sizes and shapes through controllable wet chemical processes. As the lengths of the edges of the Ag NPLs increased, their surface plasmon resonance bands broadened, with the maximum extinction wavelength extending to as far as 750 nm. After embedding various types of Ag NPLs into the PEDOT:PSS [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/polystyrenesulfonate] layer, the short-circuit photocurrent density increased by 7.6-17.5%, relative to that of the pre-optimized control PVs, with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increasing by up to 13%. We obtained an optimized PCE of 8.5% for normal PVSK device under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm-2). After the incorporation of Ag NPLs, a much higher PCE of 9.6% was obtained. External quantum efficiencies were increased significantly as a result of the increased plasmonic scattering effect of Ag NPLs. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
