Physics ruling the temperature sensitivity of photovoltaic (PV) cells is discussed. Dependences with temperature of the fundamental losses for single junction solar cells are examined and fundamental temperature coefficients (TCs) are calculated. Impacts on TCs of the incident spectrum and of variations of the bandgap with temperature are highlighted. It is shown that the unusual behavior of the bandgaps of perovskite semiconductor compounds such as CH<inf>3</inf>NH<inf>3</inf>PbI<inf>3-x</inf>Cl<inf>x</inf> and CsSnI<inf>3</inf> will ultimately, in the radiative limit, give PV cells made of these materials peculiar temperature sensitivities. The different losses limiting the efficiency of present commercial cells are depicted on a p-n junction diagram. This representation provides valuable information on the energy transfer mechanisms within PV cells. In particular, it is shown that an important fraction of the heat generation occurs at the junction. A review of the loss mechanisms driving the temperature coefficients of the different cell parameters (open circuit voltage V<inf>oc</inf>, short circuit current density J<inf>sc</inf>, fill factor FF) is proposed. The temperature sensitivity of open circuit voltage is connected to the balance between generation and recombination of carriers and its variation with temperature. A general expression that relates the temperature sensitivity of V<inf>oc</inf> to the External Radiative Efficiency (ERE) of a solar cell is provided. Comparisons with experimental data are discussed. The impacts of bandgap temperature dependence and incident spectrum on the temperature sensitivity of short circuit current are demonstrated. Finally, it is argued that if the fill factor temperature sensitivity is ideally closely related to the open circuit voltage temperature sensitivity of the cell, it depends for some cells strongly on technological issues linked to carrier transport such as contact resistances.
