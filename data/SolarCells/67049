The Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) consist of a film containing optically active centers, converting part of the absorbing radiation into a specific emitting wavelength, when exposed to sunlight. The emitting centers are also crucial factors regarding their efficiency, so the selection must be done carefully. Here, we introduce organometal halide perovskite as a new class of phosphors, to use in luminescent solar concentrators. The coating of a Si PV cell with an organometal halide perovskite is tested. The obtained results reveal that, to find a suitable condition for effective LSC, it is necessary to determine appropriate molar ratio of organic and inorganic portion in synthesis perovskite, as well as concentration of halide perovskite in LSC. It is found that CH<inf>3</inf>NH<inf>3</inf>PbBr<inf>3</inf> perovskite with the CH<inf>3</inf>NH<inf>2</inf>/PbBr<inf>2</inf>: 6/1 M ratio and 7.0 wt% perovskite concentration in Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) leads to the highest efficiency (increased about 45%, compared to uncoated cell).
