Isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) by size exclusion is a widely researched technique that offers the advantage of capturing tumor cells without reliance on cell surface expression markers. In this work, we report the development of a novel polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane filter-based microdevice for rapid and highly efficient isolation of CTCs from peripheral blood. A precise and highly porous PDMS microfilter was fabricated and integrated into the microfiltration chip by combining a sacrificial transferring film with a sandwich molding method. We achieved >90% recovery when isolating lung cancer cells from spiked blood samples, with a relatively high processing throughput of 10. mL/h. In contrast to existing CTC filtration systems, which rely on low-porosity track-etch filters or expensive lithography-based filters, our microfiltration chip does not require complex e-beam lithography or the reactive ion etching process, therefore it offers a low-cost alternative tool for highly efficient CTC enrichment and in situ analysis. Thus, this new microdevice has the potential for use in routine monitoring of cancer development and cancer therapy in a clinical setting. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
