Background: Lung cancer is one of the most frequent cancer types and the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), however, its positive effects are diminished under hypoxia. We wanted to determine if co-treatment with cisplatin and histone deacetalyse (HDAC) inhibitor panobinostat can reduce hypoxia-induced cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells, and to elucidate mechanism involved. Methods: Expression status of different HDACS was determined in two cell lines and in tumor tissue from 20 patients. Cells were treated with cisplatin, panobinostat, or with combination of both under normoxic and hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. Cell cycle, viability, acetylation of histones, and activation of apoptosis were determined. HIF-1α stability and its interaction with HDAC4 were analyzed. Results: Most class I and II HDACs were expressed in NSCLC cells and tumor samples. Co-treatment of tumor cells with cisplatin and panobinostat decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis more efficiently than in primary, non-malignant bronchial epithelial cells. Co-treatment induced apoptosis by causing chromatin fragmentation, activation of caspases-3 and 7 and PARP cleavage. Toxic effects were more pronounced under hypoxic conditions. Co-treatment resulted in destabilization and degradation of HIF-1α and HDAC4, a protein responsible for acetylation and de/stabilization of HIF-1α. Direct interaction between HDAC4 and HIF-1α proteins in H23 cells was detected. Conclusions: Here we show that hypoxia-induced cisplatin resistance can be overcome by combining cisplatin with panobinostat, a potent HDAC inhibitor. These findings may contribute to the development of a new therapeutic strategy for NSCLC. © 2015 Fischer et al.
