Technological change is a human activity that generates a huge economic impact, also causing social change and specific environmental disorders. In particular, technological innovations support the industrial change and human development, which by social mechanisms of population growth, mass production and consumption can also engender diffusion of some genotoxic carcinogens. This study seems to show a main interrelationship between higher technological performance in OECD countries and incidence of some cancers, controlling screening technology that is a main indicator of better healthcare across countries. A vital relationship between observed facts endeavours to explain the interaction between diffusion of technology across countries and incidence of some diseases in society. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
