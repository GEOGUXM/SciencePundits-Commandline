Two pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp∗) rhodium(III) and iridium(III) metalla-prisms of the general formula [(Cp∗M)<inf>6</inf>(tpt)<inf>2</inf>(dhnq)<inf>3</inf>]6+ (tpt = 2,4,6-tri-(pyridin-4-yl)-1,3,5-triazine, dhnq = 5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinonato; M = Rh, [1]6+; M = Ir, [2]6+) have been synthesized by mixing in methanol the neutral dinuclear complexes (Cp∗M)<inf>2</inf>(dhnq)Cl<inf>2</inf> (M = Rh, Ir), AgCF<inf>3</inf>SO<inf>3</inf> and tpt. In a similar fashion, the addition of porphin during the formation of [1]6+ and [2]6+ leads to the carceplex systems [porphin1]6+ and [porphin2]6+. All complexes were isolated as their triflate salts and characterized by different analytical techniques including for the carceplex [porphin1][CF<inf>3</inf>SO<inf>3</inf>]<inf>6</inf> by a single-crystal X-ray structure analysis. The hosts were evaluated as drug delivery vectors on the HT-29 cancer cell line, and after internalization, porphin was photo-activated to generate phototoxicity. Interestingly, the IC<inf>50</inf> values of the empty and filled metalla-cages are around 1 μM, while upon irradiation (20 J/cm2) only lower nanomolar concentrations of the [porphincage][CF<inf>3</inf>SO<inf>3</inf>]<inf>6</inf> systems are necessary to inhibit cell growth by 50%, showing an excellent ratio between cytotoxicity and phototoxicity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.
