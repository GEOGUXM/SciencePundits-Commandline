In this paper, the core-shell structured magnetic-fluorescent microspheres (denoted as Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>@YPO<inf>4</inf>:Eu3+) were synthesized using a combination method of homogeneous precipitation approach and ion exchange means. The multifunctional luminomagnetic microspheres possessed high saturation magnetization (M<inf>s</inf>=35.7 emu/g) and superparamagnetism. Prominent emission peaks at 552 and 619 nm (EX: 225 nm) and an emission peak at 586 nm (EX: 395 nm) of Eu3+ were observed. The multifunctional Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>@YPO<inf>4</inf>:Eu3+ microspheres with magnetic and optical would have potential biomedical applications such as MRI, optical imaging, drug carrier, hyperthermia in cancer therapy, and sorting and separation of cancer cells, bacteria and viruses.
