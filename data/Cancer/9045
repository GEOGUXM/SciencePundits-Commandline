The antiproliferative effects of a purified white grape pomace extract (PWGPE), as well as of some phenolic standards on colon cancer cells were examined. The phenolic composition of the PWGPE was determined by rapid resolution liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (RRLC/MS). The PWGPE had 92.6, 43.3 and 6.01 mg/g of flavanols, flavonols and phenolic acids, respectively and, along with pure catechin, epicatechin, quercetin and gallic acid, they were all found capable of inhibiting cellular proliferation. PWGPE (100 μg/ml) inhibited the proliferation of cells by 52.1% at 48 h, whilst catechin, epicatechin, quercetin and gallic acid (60 μg/ml) inhibited growth by 65.2%, 62.2%, 81.0% and 71.0%, respectively, at 72 h. The PWGPE is an interesting source of phenolic compounds with antiproliferative properties, that could be of interest in the food and pharmaceutical industries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
