In this study, we synthesized dual aptamer-modified silica nanoparticles that simultaneously target two types of breast cancer cells: the mucin 1 (MUC1)(+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)(+) cell lines. Dual aptamer system enables a broad diagnosis for breast cancer in comparison with the single aptamer system. The dye-doped silica nanoparticles offer great stability with respect to photobleaching and enable the accurate quantification of breast cancer cells. The morphological and spectroscopic characteristics of the designed Dual-SiNPs were demonstrated via diverse methods such as DLS, zeta potential measurements, UV-vis spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Negatively charged Dual-SiNPs with a homogeneous size distribution showed robust and strong fluorescence. In addition, Dual-SiNPs did not affect cell viability, implying that this probe might be readily available for use in an in vivo system. Through ratio optimization of the MUC1 and HER2 aptamers, the binding capacities of the Dual-SiNPs to both cell lines were maximized. Based on Dual-SiNPs, a highly sensitive quantification of breast cancer cells was performed, resulting in a detection limit of 1. cell/100. μL, which is significantly lower compared with those reported in other studies. Moreover, the developed detection platform displayed high selectivity for only the MUC1(+) and HER2(+) cell lines. It is expected that this valuable diagnostic probe will be a noteworthy platform for the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
