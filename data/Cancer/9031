Purpose Biallelic mutations in ATM cause ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), a rare inherited disease with a high incidence of cancer. Precise estimates of the risk, presentation, and outcomes of cancer in patients with AT need to be addressed in large series. Patients and Methods In this large retrospective cohort, 69 patients with cancers (24.5%) were identified among 279 patients with AT. Centralized review was performed on 60% of the lymphomas. Incidence rates were compared with the French population, and risk factors were analyzed. Results Eight patients developed acute leukemias (including four T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias), 12 developed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 38 developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), three developed T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), and eight developed carcinoma at a median age of 8.3, 10.6, 9.7, 24.2, and 31.4 years, respectively (P < .001). The majority of NHLs were aggressive B-cell NHL. Epstein-Barr virus was associated with all of the HLs and 50% of the NHLs. Overall survival was shorter in patients with AT who developed cancer compared with those who did not develop cancer (15 v 24 years, respectively; P < .001). Survival was improved in patients who achieved a major response to treatment (3.46 v 0.87 years for major v minor responses, respectively; P = .011). Immunodeficiency was associated with increased risk of cancer. ATM mutation type was associated with a difference in survival in the entire cohort but not with cancer incidence or cancer survival. Conclusion B-cell NHL, HL, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia occur at a high rate and earlier age than carcinomas in AT. T-PLLs are rarer than initially reported. Prognosis is poor, but patients may benefit from treatment with an improved survival. Â© 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.
