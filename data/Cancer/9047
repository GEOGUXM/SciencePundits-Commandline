Background: ERBB4 plays an important role in the etiology and progression of lung cancer. Results: miR-193a-3p suppressed proliferation and invasion and promoted apoptosis in lung cancer cells and xenograft mice by negatively regulating ERBB4. Conclusion: miR-193a-3p exerted an anti-tumor effect by negatively regulating ERBB4 in lung cancer. Significance: This study may open new avenues for future lung cancer therapies.
