Recent reports have indicated that aberrant expression of microRNAs is highly correlated with occurrence of lung cancer. Therefore, highly sensitive detection of lung cancer specific microRNAs provides an attractive approach in lung cancer early diagnostics. Herein, we designed 3D DNA origami structure that enables electrochemical detection of lung cancer related microRNAs. The 3D DNA origami structure is constituted of a ferrocene-tagged DNA of stem-loop structure combined with a thiolated tetrahedron DNA nanostructure at the bottom. The top portion hybridized with the lung cancer correlated microRNA, while the bottom portion was self-assembled on gold disk electrode surface, which was modified with gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and blocked with mercaptoethanol (MCH). The preparation process and the performance of the proposed electrochemical genosensor were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Under the optimal conditions, the developed genosensor had a detection limit of 10. pM and a good linearity with microRNA concentration ranging from 100. pM to 1. μM, which showed a great potential in highly sensitive clinical cancer diagnosis application. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
