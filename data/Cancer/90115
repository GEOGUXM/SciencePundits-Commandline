Abstract The coordination of therapeutically interesting designed complexes of stoichiometry [ML(Met)Cl<inf>2</inf>] [where M = Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Mn(II) and Zn(II), L = benzylidene-4-aminoantipyrine and Met = methionine] has been ascertained on the basis of physicochemical techniques. Their interaction with CT DNA reveals that they are good intercalators. The anticancer mechanism of our complexes is documented from their enhanced DNA splitting personalities under physiological conditions. To reveal the chemotherapeutic action of these complexes, we explored the inflammatory response, analgesic and antioxidant activities. Moreover, all the complexes show good antimicrobial activity against few bacterial and fungal strains. Our study has identified the mechanism of action of these complexes on inhibiting tumor cells and suggested that they have great potential as novel anticancer agents. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
