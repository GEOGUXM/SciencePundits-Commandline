Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution can lead to chronic health effects such as cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Systemic inflammation has been hypothesized as a putative biological mechanism contributing to these adverse health effects. We evaluated the effect of long-term exposure to air pollution on blood markers of systemic inflammation.We measured a panel of 28 inflammatory markers in peripheral blood samples from 587 individuals that were biobanked as part of a prospective study. Participants were from Varese and Turin (Italy) and Umea (Sweden). Long-term air pollution estimates of nitrogen oxides (NO<inf>x</inf>) were available from the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE). Linear mixed models adjusted for potential confounders were applied to assess the association between NO<inf>x</inf> and the markers of inflammation.Long-term exposure to NO<inf>x</inf> was associated with decreased levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α in Italy, but not in Sweden. NO<inf>x</inf> exposure levels were considerably lower in Sweden than in Italy (Sweden: median (5th, 95th percentiles) 6.65μg/m3 (4.8, 19.7); Italy: median (5th, 95th percentiles) 94.2μg/m3 (7.8, 124.5)). Combining data from Italy and Sweden we only observed a significant association between long-term exposure to NO<inf>x</inf> and decreased levels of circulating IL-8.We observed some indication for perturbations in the inflammatory markers due to long-term exposure to NO<inf>x</inf>. Effects were stronger in Italy than in Sweden, potentially reflecting the difference in air pollution levels between the two cohorts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
