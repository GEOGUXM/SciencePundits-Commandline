This study derived a simple equation of effective dose (E) versus normal organ of patients with varying body weights undergoing lung cancer treatment of helical tomotherapy (TOMO). Five tissue-equivalent and Rando phantoms were used to simulate lung cancer patients. This study then measured E and equivalent dose of organ or tissues (D<inf>T</inf>) using thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD-100H). The TLD-100H was calibrated using TOMO 6MV photons, then inserted into phantom positions that closely corresponded with the position of the represented organs and tissues. Both E and D<inf>T</inf> were evaluated by ICRP 103. Peripheral doses varied markedly at positions close to the tumor center. The maximum statistical and total errors were 16.7-22.3%. This analytical result indicates that E of Rando and tissue-equivalent phantoms was in the ranged of 9.44±1.70 (10kg) to 4.58±0.83 (90kg)mSv/Gy. Notably, E decreased exponentially as phantom weight increased. Peripheral doses were also evaluated by TLD as a function of distance from the tumor center. Finally, experimental results are compared with those in literature. These findings will prove useful to patients, physicians, radiologists, and the public. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
