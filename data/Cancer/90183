Luminescent porous silicon nanoparticles with mean size of about 100 nm were covered by biodegradable polymer (dextran) and were investigated as potential sensitizers for ultrasound-assisted therapy. Luminescent confocal microscopy revealed an efficient uptake of the nanoparticles by cancer cells in vitro. The nanoparticles were found to be almost nontoxic up to the concentration of 0.1 mg/mL and doses of 30 mg/kg as it was confirmed by in vitro and in vivo experiments, respectively. A strong suppression of the cancer cell proliferation was observed after a combined treatment by the nanoparticles and therapeutic ultrasound irradiation with frequencies of 1-3 MHz and intensities of 1-2 W/cm2. The obtained results are discussed in view of potential applications of biocompatible and biodegradable silicon-based nanoparticles in sonodynamic therapy of cancer. Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.
