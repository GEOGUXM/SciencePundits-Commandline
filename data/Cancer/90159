A series of furo[3,2-c]coumarin derivatives 1a-d were synthesized and evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against MCF-7 breast and HCT-15 colon cancer cell lines using Sulfo-rhodamine B (SRB) assay. Compounds 1b and 1d showed higher antiproliferative activity than 1a and 1c. UV-Vis spectroscopy was used for DNA and BSA-binding affinity of the compounds 1b and 1d and gave overall affinity constants of K<inf>1b</inf><inf>-DNA</inf> = 8.1 × 103 M-1, K<inf>1d</inf><inf>-DNA</inf> = 1.1 × 104 M-1, K<inf>1b</inf><inf>-BSA</inf> = 5.1 × 104 M-1, and K<inf>1d</inf><inf>-BSA</inf> = 7.6 × 104 M-1. Our findings could provide new evidence showing the relationship between the chemical structure and anticancer activity of these new coumarin analogs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
