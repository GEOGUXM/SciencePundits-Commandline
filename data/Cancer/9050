MicroRNAs have been identified as promising biomarkers for human diseases. The development of a point-of-care (POC) test for the disease-associated miRNAs would be especially beneficial, since miRNAs are unexpectedly well preserved in various human specimens, including urine. Here, we present the Mach-Zehnder interferometer-miRNA detection system capable of detecting multiple miRNAs in clinical urine samples rapidly and simultaneously in a label-free and real-time manner. Through measurement of the light phase change, the MZI sensor provides an optical platform for fast profiling of small molecules with improved accuracy. We demonstrate that this system could specifically detect target miRNAs (miR-21, and let-7a), and even identify the single nucleotide polymorphism of the let-7 family of miRNAs from synthetic and cell line samples. The clinical applicability of this system is confirmed by simultaneously detecting two types of miRNAs in urine samples of bladder cancer patients in a single reaction, with a detection time of 15. min. The POC system can be expanded to detect a number of miRNAs of different species and should be useful for a variety of clinical applications requiring at or near the site of patient care.
