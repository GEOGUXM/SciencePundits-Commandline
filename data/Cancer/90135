σ<inf>2</inf> Receptor subtype is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors, with σ<inf>2</inf> agonists showing antiproliferative effects towards tumor cells through multiple pathways that depend both on the tumor cell type and on the molecule type. Therefore, σ<inf>2</inf> receptor is an intriguing target for tumor diagnosis and treatment despite the fact that that it has not yet been cloned. One of the last attempts to characterize σ<inf>2</inf> receptors led to identify it as the progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1). Although still controversial, such identity appears to have been accepted. We the aim of contributing to solve this controversy, in this work we stably silenced or overexpressed PGRMC1 protein in human MCF7 adenocarcinoma cells. Western blotting analyses were performed to quantify the presence of PGRMC1 protein on each of the three MCF7 cell lines variants, while scatchard analyses with radioligand were performed in order to determine the expression of the σ<inf>2</inf> receptors. In order to correlate the antiproliferative effect of σ<inf>2</inf> receptor agonist with PGRMC1 density, some σ<inf>2</inf> ligands were administered to each of the three MCF7 cells variants. The results suggested that PGRMC1 and σ<inf>2</inf> receptors are two different molecular entities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
