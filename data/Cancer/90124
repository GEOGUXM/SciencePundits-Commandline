Abstract Most of the administered anti-cancer drugs are hydrophobic in nature and are known to have poor water solubility, short residence time, rapid clearance from the body and systemic side effects. Polymeric-based targeted particulate carrier system has shown to directly deliver the encapsulated anti-cancer drug to the desired site of action and prevent the interaction of encapsulated drug with the normal cells. Pluronic F127 (PF127) has been widely investigated for its broad-range of therodiagnostic applications in biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences, but rapid dissolution in the physiological fluids, short residence time, rapid clearance, and weak mechanical strength are the main shortcomings that are associated with PF127 and have recently been overcome by making various modifications in the structure of PF127 notably through preparation of PF127-based mixed polymeric micelles, PF127-conjugated nanoparticles and PF127-based hydrophobically modified thermogels. In this article, we have briefly discussed the recent studies that have been conducted on various anti-cancer drugs using PF127 as nano-carrier modified with other copolymers and/or conjugated with magnetic nanoparticles. The key findings of these studies demonstrated that the modified form of PF127 can significantly increase the stability of incorporated hydrophobic drugs with enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of anti-cancer drugs. Moreover, the modified form of PF127 has also shown its therapeutic potentials as therodiagnostics in various types of tumors and cancers. Hence, it can be concluded that the modified form of PF127 exhibits significant therodiagnostic effects with increased tumor-specific delivery of anti-cancer drugs having minimal toxic effects as compared to PF127 alone and/or other copolymers.
