Collagen, a primary component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), is highly expressed in a variety of cancers and influences the tumor microenvironment by increasing the recruitment of macrophages and endothelial cells. Therefore, collagen is a highly promising target for cancer therapy. The collagen-binding domain (CBD) can dynamically bind to collagen and achieve the sustained release of CBD-fused protein in the collagen network. Here, we developed a collagen-binding epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody fragment for targeting the collagen-rich ECM in tumors. The single chain fragment variable (scFv) of cetuximab was fused to CBD (CBD-scFv) and expressed in Pichia pastoris. CBD-scFv preserved the antigen binding domain and anti-tumor activity of cetuximab in vitro. Moreover, CBD-scFv displayed a collagen binding ability due to the function of CBD. In vivo experiments revealed that CBD-scFv bound to collagen and achieved sustained release in tumors. Furthermore, CBD-scFv significantly suppressed the growth of tumors in A431 xenografts. Therefore, CBD-scFv had a potential therapeutic value for the collagen-rich carcinomas. The specific target and sustained release of CBD-scFv in tumors could be a new approach for targeted drug delivery in cancer therapy. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.
