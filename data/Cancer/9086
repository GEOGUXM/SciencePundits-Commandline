The extent of squaraine dye aggregation that reflects on surface enhanced Raman signal scattering (SERS) intensity upon adsorption on nano-roughened gold surface has been investigated. Here we have synthesized a serious of six squaraine dyes consisting of two different electron donor moiety i.e. 1,1,2-trimethyl-1H-benzo[e]indole and 2-methylbenzo[d]thiazole which modulates the chemisorptions and hydrophobicity being designated as SQ1, SQ2, SQ3, SQ4, SQ5 and SQ6. Interestingly, SQ2 (mono lipoic acid appended), SQ5 and SQ6 (conjugated with hexyl and dodecyl side chain) squaraine derivatives having more tendency of aggregation in DMSO-water mixed solvent showed significant increase of Raman scattering in the fingerprint region when chemisorbed on spherical gold nanoparticles. Two sets of SERS nanotags were prepared with colloidal gold nanoparticle (Au-NPs size: 40. nm) by incorporating Raman reporters SQ2 and SQ5 followed by thiolated PEG encapsulation (SH-PEG, SH-PEG-COOH) denoted as AuNPs-SQ2-PEG and AuNPs-SQ5-PEG. Further conjugation of these nanotag with monoclonal antibodies specific to over expressed receptors, EGFR and p16/Ki-67 in cervical cancer cell, HeLa showed prominent SERS mapping intensity and selectivity towards cell surface and nucleus. The fast and accurate recognition obtained by antibody triggered SERS-nanotag has been compared with conventional time consuming immunocytochemistry technique which prompted us to extend further investigation using real patient cervical smear sample for a non-invasive, ultrafast and accurate diagnosis.
