This paper describes development of 169Yb-seeds by encapsulating 0.6-0.65mm (ϕ) sized 169Yb<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> microspheres in titanium capsules. Microspheres synthesized by a sol-gel route were characterized by XRD, SEM/EDS and ICP-AES. Optimization of neutron irradiation was accomplished and 169Yb-seeds up to 74MBq of 169Yb could be produced from natural Yb<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf> microspheres, which have the potential for use in prostate brachytherapy. A protocol to prepare 169Yb-brachytherapy sources (2.96-3.7TBq of 169Yb) with the use of enriched targets was also formulated. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
