Βeta-sitosterol (β-SITO), a phytosterol present in pomegranate, peanut, corn oil, almond, and avocado, has been recognized to offer health benefits and potential clinical uses. β-SITO is orally bioavailable and, as a constituent of edible natural products, is considered to have no undesired side effects. It has also been considered as a potent anticancer agent. However, the molecular mechanism of action of β-SITO as a tubulin-binding anticancer agent and its binding site on tubulin are poorly understood. Using a combination of biochemical analyses and molecular dynamic simulation, we investigated the molecular details of the binding interactions of β-SITO with tubulin. A polymer mass assay comparing the effects of β-SITO and of taxol and vinblastine on tubulin assembly showed that this phytosterol stabilized microtubule assembly in a manner similar to taxol. An 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid assay confirmed the direct interaction of β-SITO with tubulin. Although β-SITO did not show direct binding to the colchicine site on tubulin, it stabilized the colchicine binding. Interestingly, no sulfhydryl groups of tubulin were involved in the binding interaction of β-SITO with tubulin. Based on the results from the biochemical assays, we computationally modeled the binding of β-SITO with tubulin. Using molecular docking followed by molecular dynamic simulations, we found that β-SITO binds tubulin at a novel site (which we call the 'SITO site') adjacent to the colchicine and noscapine sites. Our data suggest that β-SITO is a potent anticancer compound that interferes with microtubule assembly dynamics by binding to a novel site on tubulin. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
