Introduction: An innovative approach, called associated liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy(ALPPS), has made possible a marked increase in future liver remnant (FLR) volume over a short period of time, thus permitting extended hepatectomy. Case description: This report describes ALPPS in a 63-year-old male patient with rectal cancer and synchronous multiple liver metastases. The primary lesion was resected, followed by chemotherapy. We had planned to completely resect the metastases in both liver lobes, but CT volumetry revealed a very small FLR (364 ml, 29% of the total liver volume, 0.61% of total body weight). His indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes was 12.7%. Because of the risk of tumor progression in the interim, we performed ALPPS. During the first stage, the tumor in segment 3 was resected, the right lobe was mobilized, the liver was partitioned, and the right portal vein was ligated. The right hepatic artery, duct and vein were secured with vessel loops. CT on postoperative day 6 showed sufficient FLR increase (from 364 ml to 573 ml, or from 0.61% to 0.96% of total body weight) and ICGR15 improvement to 3.4%. The second stage of ALPPS was on postoperative day 7, completing resection of the metastases. The patient recovered well and was discharged 21 days after the second step. Discussion and evaluation: The ALPPS approach has many advantages, but it lacks evidence of long-term results. Considering the high mortality and morbidity rates of ALPPS, it is essential to evaluate its risks and benefits in individual patients and determine the strict criteria for this surgical method. Conclusions: ALPPS procedure rapidly increases FLR, permitting extended hepatectomy for patients with initially insufficient FLR. Â© 2015, Ome et al.; licensee Springer.
