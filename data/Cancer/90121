Ultradeformable liposomes represent useful formulations able to increase the skin permeation of drug compounds. In this study, resveratrol- and 5-fluorouracil-loaded ultradeformable liposomes were investigated for the potential treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer. The in vitro anticancer activity of ultradeformable liposomes was tested on human skin cancer cells through viability-, cell cycle- and apoptosis-analysis. Furthermore, we tested the percutaneous permeation of ultradeformable liposomes using human stratum corneum and viable epidermis. The co-encapsulation of resveratrol and 5-fluorouracil (multi-drug carrier) in ultradeformable liposomes improved their anticancer activity on skin cancer cells as compared to both the free drug form and the single entrapped agents. These multi-drug ultradeformable liposomes arrest cell proliferation in G<inf>1</inf>/S, thus modifying the action of 5-fluorouracil and increasing the activity of resveratrol. This effect might depend on the ultradeformable liposomes, which may accumulate in deeper skin layers, thus generating a cutaneous depot from which resveratrol and 5-fluorouracil are gradually released. Resveratrol and 5-fluorouracil co-loaded ultradeformable liposomes could be a new nanomedicine for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma, i.e., actinic keratosis, Bowen's disease, and keratoacanthoma.
