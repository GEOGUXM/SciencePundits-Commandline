Background: Plant metabolites have wide applications and have the potential to cure different diseases caused by microorganisms. The aim of the study was to evaluate the antimicrobial, antibiofilm, cytotoxic, antifeedant and larvicidal properties of novel quinine isolated from Aegle marmelos (Linn.) Correa. Methods: A compound was obtained by eluting the crude extract, using varying concentrations of the solvents by the chromatographic purification. Broth micro dilution method was used to assess the antimicrobial activity and anticancer study was evaluated using MTT assay. Larvicidal activity was studied using leaf disc no-choice method. Results: Based on the IR, 13C NMR and 1H NMR spectral data, the compounds were identified as quinone related antibiotic. It exhibited significant activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. The lowest Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the compound against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus was 100 and 75 μg mL-1 respectively. Against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa it exhibited MIC value of 25 μg mL-1. The MIC of the compound against Aspergillus niger, A. clavatus, Penicillium roqueforti was 20 μg mL-1 and that against Fusarium oxysporum (20 μg mL-1), A. oryzae (40 μg mL-1), and Candida albicans (60 μg mL-1), respectively. It showed effective antibiofilm activity against E. coli, S. typhii and P. aeroginosa at 8 μg mL-1 and did not exhibit considerable cytotoxic activity against Vero and HEP2 cell lines. Additionally, the compound documented significant antifeedant and larvicidal activities against Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera litura at 125, 250, 500 and 1000 ppm concentrations. Conclusion: The results concluded that the compound can be evaluated further in industrial applications and also an agent to prepare botanical new pesticide formulations.
