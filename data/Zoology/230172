Rovnosoma gracile gen. et sp. nov. is described from the amber collection of the Schmalhausen Institute of Zoology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (Kiev). A short comparative morphological analysis is provided. As all known Encyrtidae of the Late Eocene Rovno amber fauna, the new genus is characterized by long veins of the forewings. Archaic venation is combined in this genus with the presence of filum spinosum, transverse hypopygium not reaching the apex of the metasoma, and three-dentate mandibles. Such a combination of characters allows assigning the new genus to the subfamily Encyrtinae. Â© 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.
