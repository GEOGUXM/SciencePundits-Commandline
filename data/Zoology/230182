Mycodiplosis sp. (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) was newly recorded from Taiwan for the first time. In this study, morphological characters for the species were illustrated. Besides, rust fungi (Phakospora ampelopsidis Dietel & P. Syd.) is a food source for the larval stage of Mycodiplosis sp., consequently the gungus-feeding maggots could serve as potential biological control agents. The voucher specimens were deposited in the Insect and Mite Museum, Division of Applied Zoology, TARI. Â©, 2015, Plant Protection Society of the Republic of China. All right reserved.
