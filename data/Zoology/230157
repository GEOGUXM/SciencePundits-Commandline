Sex allocation theory predicts the optimal investment to male and female offspring. However, a biased sex ratio requires explanations as to why the deviation occurs. Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is the most widely distributed nonhuman primate species and the Taihangshan macaque (Macaca mulatta tcheliensis) occupies the northern limit of all rhesus macaque natural populations worldwide. We observed one macaque troop (Wangwu-1 [WW-1]) inhabiting Taihangshan Macaque National Nature Reserve and recorded all birth events and the sex of newborn macaques from 2004 to 2013. Our aim was to apply the Trivers-Willard hypothesis to this free-ranging rhesus macaque troop, and to understand the relationship between climatic parameters (precipitation and temperature) and birth sex ratio. We found that the total newborn macaques showed a female-biased sex ratio at birth in the WW-1 troop, but there were no significant biased birth sex ratios in all matriarchs and in high-ranking and middle-ranking matrilineal units. However, the low-ranking macaque matrilineal unit was significantly female-biased. Moreover, we found that the annual precipitation of the previous year was positively associated with the birth sex ratio, and there was an interactive effect of troop size and current winter temperature on the birth sex ratio. The underlying mechanisms for the effects of social and climatic factors on birth sex ratio could be complex, and we discuss several plausible explanations.
