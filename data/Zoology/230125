After more than one hundred fifty years of the publication of On the Origin of Species by Darwin, scientists are still arguing on the relative importance of mutation and natural selection, on the driving force of organismal evolution, on microevolution and macroevolution, etc. Such periodically repeated debates appeared to have introduced more chaos than musings. What happened and why? Have we really considered our views, opinions and arguments under the big picture of evolution before posing the questions? Or are we talking past each other? We do need some reflections. While we believe that the current evolutionary theory is doing fine, perhaps a refinement or re-encapsulation of its knowledge framework can help promote a better understanding of the evolutionary science as a whole and blow off the mist over the big picture.
