In vivo electroporation is a very powerful technology that enables both gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses. However, the device required for the method is expensive. Here, we report a simple, inexpensive (under US$85), easily constructed, and one-piece electroporation device for gene functional analyses of insects. Using this simple electroporator, we successfully introduced exogenous fluorescence protein genes into three moth species. This simple low-cost electroporator will render gene function analyses accessible to many non-model insects, including pest species. Â© 2014, The Japanese Society of Applied Entomology and Zoology.
