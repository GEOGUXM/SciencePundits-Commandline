The fruit-piercing moth Oraesia excavata (Butler) only attacks ripe as opposed to immature peach fruits. The moth putatively uses volatile emissions from ripe peach fruits as a cue for food orientation. The volatiles emitted by ‘Hakutou’ peach (Prunus persica L.) fruit during maturation were analyzed by headspace solid-phase microextraction followed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Although seven compounds increased remarkably during maturation, among them, only ethyl acetate and ethyl butanoate elicited electroantennographic responses. During a field-trap test, traps baited with both compounds captured moths, but significantly fewer moths were captured by the traps as compared to peach fruit. However, traps baited with a mixture of both compounds and lactones peculiar to ripe peach fruits captured more moths than did traps with ripe peach fruits only. The results of a seasonal survey using this mixture as an attractant suggest that seasonal forecasting of the fruit-piercing moth is possible. © 2015, The Japanese Society of Applied Entomology and Zoology.
