Ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle (USP) form heterodimers to mediate ecdysteroid signaling during molting and metamorphosis. Various EcR/USP heterodimers have been reported. However, it is unclear what kind of EcR/USP combination is adopted by lepidopteran insects during the larval-pupal metamorphosis and whether the EcR/USP heterodimer varies among different tissues. To address these questions, two isoforms of each EcR and USP were cloned from the common cutworm, their messenger RNA expression patterns were examined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in different tissues during the larval-pupal metamorphosis and in the midgut in response to hormonal induction. Furthermore, their subcellular localization and protein-protein interaction were explored by transient expression and far-western blotting, respectively. All the four genes were significantly up-regulated in prepuae and/or pupae. The expression profiles of EcRB1 and USP1 were nearly identical to each other in the epidermis, fat body and midgut, and a similar situation also applied to EcRA and USP2. The three genes responded to 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) induction except for USP2, and USP1 could be up-regulated by both 20E and juvenile hormone. The four proteins mainly localized in the nucleus and the nuclear localization was promoted by 20E. The protein-protein interaction between each EcR and USP was found in vitro. These results suggest that two types of EcR/USP heterodimer (EcRA/USP2 and EcRB1/USP1) may exist simultaneously in the common cutworm, and the latter should play more important roles during the larval-pupal metamorphosis. In addition, the types of EcR/USP heterodimer do not vary in the tissues which undergo histolysis and regeneration during metamorphosis. Â© 2014 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
