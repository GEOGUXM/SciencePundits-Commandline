Objective: To study the sandflies distribution within their climatic and ecological context in three transects of Morocco: Ouarzazat-Mhamid, Foum Zguid-Marrakesh and Erfoud-Nador. Methods: In total, twenty-nine stations were prospected, through 1 800 Km, including four zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis foci (Ouarzazat, Zagora, Tata and Errachidia). Sand flies were collected using sticky paper traps for one night. Results: Overall, 7 140 sandflies were collected along the three transects. In the combined collections, nine Phlebotomus species: Phlebotomus papatasi (27.6%), Phlebotomus longicuspis (19%), Phlebotomus sergenti (18.2%), Phlebotomus perniciosus (6.2%), Phlebotomus bergeroti (2.9%), Phlebotomus alexandri (1.4%), Phlebotomus chadlii (0.8%), Phlebotomus chabaudi (0.5%) and Phlebotomus ariasi (0.5%) and five Sergentomyia species: Sergentomyia minuta (10.4%), Sergentomyia fallax (8.1%), Sergentomyia dreyfussi (2.1%), Sergentomyia christophersi (1.7%) and Sergentomyia africana (0.5%) were detected. Conclusions: We update the entomological data in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis foci and discuss the possible effect of many ecological factors as bioclimate, biotopes and altitude on the diversity and distribution of caught species.
