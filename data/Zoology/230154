Recombinant baculoviruses have traditionally been generated by homologous recombination, in insect cells, of the virus DNA and a transfer vector. This method is, however, restricted to the small number of baculoviruses for which permissive cell lines are available. An alternative method, which avoids this limitation, is the bacmid system, in which a bacterial DNA cassette (BAC cassette) comprising a bacterial replication origin, an antibiotic resistance marker gene, and a transposon element, is inserted into a unique restriction endonuclease site of the virus genome and the recombinant DNA is produced in Escherichia coli K-12 strain. However, if the unique cleavage site is located within an open reading frame (ORF), the ORF will be disrupted by BAC cassette insertion. In this study, we propose a gene-repair BAC method which simultaneously restores the disrupted ORF and inserts a BAC cassette into the full genome of Adoxophyes honmai nucleopolyhedrovirus.
