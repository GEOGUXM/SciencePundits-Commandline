Acute toxicities of 42 pesticides to adult stage Aphidius gifuensis Ashmead were studied in the laboratory. Adult parasitoids were brought into contact with pesticide residues on glass plates, and the resultant mortalities were measured. Abamectin, chlorfenapyr, emamectin benzoate, malathion, nitenpyram, permethrin and spinosad caused 100 % mortality against the parasitoids and were categorized as seriously harmful based on the IOBC/WPRS guideline. Chlotianidin, dinotefran, imidacloprid, lepimectin, pyridaben, thiamethoxam and tolfenpyrad also had harmful effects on A. gifuensis adults with mortalities ranging from 30 to 99 %. Sitobion akebiae (Shinji) aphids mummified by A. gifuensis were dipped into 14 pesticide solutions, and the emergence of A. gifuensis adults was observed. Abamectin, malathion, thiamethoxam and tolfenpyrad had harmful effects on mummy stage A. gifuensis with mortalities >30 %. © 2015, The Japanese Society of Applied Entomology and Zoology.
