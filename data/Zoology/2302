The calliphorid Cynomya mortuorum (L., 1761) is a forensically important species mainly found in the Palearctic region. Knowledge about its biology and ecology is scarce. Thermal constants as well as developmental time were studied at constant and variable regimes of 5 average temperatures: 14, 16, 18, 20 and 22. °C, respectively. Total developmental time varied between 15.82. ±. 0.40 days at 22. °C and 28.67. ±. 2.38 days at 14. °C, for the constant regime, and between 16.05. ±. 0.67 days at 22. °C and 32.79. ±. 1.77 days at 14. °C, for the variable regime. No significant differences were observed between ADD, and threshold at the constant (ADD: 277.39. ±. 14.78 DD; lower threshold: 4.72. °C) and variable regimes (275.99. ±. 14.16 DD; lower threshold: 5.05. °C). © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
