Introduction: Aedes albopictus was first detected in Brazil in 1986. This mosquito species presents a major threat to public health because Brazilian populations have shown substantial vector competence for arboviruses such as dengue and chikungunya. Methods: We updated the records of Ae. albopictus in several States of Brazil, focusing on areas in which its presence had been reported after 2002. Results: Twenty-eight years after its arrival in Brazil, Ae. albopictus has been detected in 24 of 27 States. Conclusions: The rapid spread of this species and its high vector competence demonstrate the danger of Ae. albopictus in Brazil. Â© 2015, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.
