We tested the role of interspecific competition in driving species distribution at multiple spatial scales using two sibling species of Galerida larks (G. cristata and G. theklae) in Morocco (sympatry), Balearic islands (G. theklae only) and Israel (G. cristata only). We first investigated regional-scale determinants by contrasting allopatric versus sympatric patterns in five distinct habitat types. We next focused on a single habitat used by both species, the coastal sand dunes. Dune quadrats were established along the Moroccan coast and completed by a quadrat in the nearest distinct landscape habitat. Poisson regressions were used to model Galerida counts together with ecological predictors as concerns the climate, topography, vegetation structure and soil granulometry. At the local scale, both species preferred grey dunes over white sand dunes, and both were negatively affected by the abundance of the congeneric species in the dune. However, we found that G. theklae tended to replace G. cristata in more arid sand dunes, even if the transition was not strictly clinal. Instead, the transition occurred when the surrounding landscape changed from coastal wetlands to bathas (grasslands with shrubs), highlighting the importance of habitat composition at the landscape scale. The fact that G. cristata used bathas in allopatry, but not in sympatry, suggested that the competitive environment contributed to determine sand dune occupancy. We suggest that landscape-level effects may be pivotal in explaining species distribution not only at the local scale, by affecting the pool of potential immigrants, but also at the regional scale, by contributing to species' range limit Â© 2015 Current Zoology.
