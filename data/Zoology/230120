Most female herbivores ensure to lay eggs where their offspring can develop successfully. The oviposition preferences of females affect strategies in pest management. In this study, the performance of two cohorts of Trichoplusia ni larvae on cabbage and cotton (after they had been transferred from their original host plants) were investigated. The preferences of female moth ovipositing and larval feeding on these two host plants were observed. The results indicated that plants significantly affected oviposition preference of the female adults and development and survival of larvae of T. ni. All females preferred to lay eggs on cabbage than cotton regardless from which host they originated. The detrimental effects of cotton on the development and survival of T. ni larvae originated from cabbage (CaTn) increased with the increase of the larval age when they were transferred. In addition, the host plant change did not significantly affect the development and survival of larvae of T. ni originating from cotton (CoTn). Larvae of CaTn preferred cabbage plants as compared to cotton plants, whereas larvae of CoTn did not show a significant choice. Although the adult females preferred laying eggs on cabbage, they did not show preferences between cotton and cabbage in a Y-tube olfactometer test. The hypothesis of oviposition preference and performance of larvae was supported by the results of CaTn, whereas they not supported by those from CoTn. Based on these results, the strategy to manage this serious pest was discussed. Â© 2014 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
