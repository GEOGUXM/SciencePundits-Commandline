In this study I investigated whether the resurgence of Tetranychus urticae Koch in apple orchards in Akita Prefecture has occurred because of broad-spectrum insecticide spraying. Plots of two management types were established. Plot A was managed for conservation of phytoseiid mites by selective chemical spraying without mowing in both 2012 and 2013. Plot B was managed by not mowing in either year, with selective chemical spraying in 2012 and spraying of pyrethroids at two-week intervals from late May to early August in 2013. In 2012, there was no significant difference between numbers of T. urticae and phytoseiid mites [Typhlodromus vulgaris (Ehara), Neoseiulus womersleyi (Schicha), and Amblyseius tsugawai (Ehara)] in the two plots. In 2013, T. urticae was present in small numbers only in plot A and T. vulgaris and A. tsugawai were observed continuously, whereas in plot B phytoseiid mites were seldom observed and T. urticae numbers increased rapidly to a peak in mid-August. These findings clearly indicate that outbreaks of T. urticae are caused by broad-spectrum insecticide spraying in apple orchards. Â© 2015, The Japanese Society of Applied Entomology and Zoology.
