The insect brain plays crucial roles in the regulation of growth and development and in all types of behavior. We used sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography - electron spray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) shotgun to identify the proteome of the silkworm brain, to investigate its protein composition and to understand their biological functions. A total of 2210 proteins with molecular weights in the range of 5.64-1539.82 kDa and isoelectric points in the range of 3.78-12.55 were identified. These proteins were annotated according to Gene Ontology Annotation into the categories of molecular function, biological process and cellular component. We characterized two categories of proteins: one includes behavior-related proteins involved in the regulation of behaviors, such as locomotion, reproduction and learning; the other consists of proteins related to the development or function of the nervous system. The identified proteins were classified into 283 different pathways according to KEGG analysis, including the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway which plays a crucial role in mediating survival signals in a wide range of neuronal cell types. This extensive protein profile provides a basis for further understanding of the physiological functions in the silkworm brain. Â© 2014 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
