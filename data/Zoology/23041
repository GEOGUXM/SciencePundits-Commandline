Aristotle (384-322 b. c. e.), prodigious philosopher who possessed extensive encyclopedic knowledge, a tireless researcher with critical and didactic sense, summarized and spanned ancient wisdom, enriching it with his valuable observations, comments, and discoveries. He was the founder of numerous areas of universal knowledge, which included the study of logic, natural history, biology, comparative anatomy, zoology, embryology, and botany.
