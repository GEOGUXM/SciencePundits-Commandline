Insects are important in the decomposition of cadavers. In the field of forensic entomology, the taxonomic identification is essential to proceed to any procedure. The use of these insects in medico criminal investigation is the object of forensic entomological studies; the flies are generally attracted to cadavers and one of the most important contributions is to estimate the postmortem interval. The scanning electron microscopy, which allows rapid and accurate identification of character could be used to help identify different species of forensics flies, has been highlighted as it allows better visualization of the external morphology of immature and some adults. The aim of this study was to describe the katepisternals in females of Morellia humeralis and Biopyrellia bipuncta; the ommatidia of the compounds eyes of the male of B. bipuncta; the antennae of females of Ophyra aenescens and Ophyra albuquerquei and the ocellar triangle of the last two species and O. chalcogaster examined by scanning electron microscopy to help increase the anatomical database on flies for forensic importance. The katepisternals of M. humeralis and B. bipuncta were densely covered by different groups of sensilla. The surface of the ocellar region of O. aenescens was not covered by sensilla, but in O. albuquerquei and O. chalcogaster were densely covered by different types of sensilla. The coeloconic sensilla were only found in the flagellum of O. albuquerquei. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
