Cecropin A1 (CecA1) promoter from Bombyx mori was cloned and characterized to provide insight into the transcriptional control of this antimicrobial peptide gene upon immune challenges. Reporter gene assays demonstrated that both Escherichia coli and lipopolysaccharide could induce expression in BmE cells but B. bombyseptieus or peptidoglycan failed, and the induction pattern of the reporter gene was coincident with the endogenous CecA1. Analysis of deletion and mutation constructs revealed that the regulatory region was the κB motif located between -176 and -166, and no other predicted elements on CecA1 promoter affected its inducibility. Insertion of additional κB motifs increased the activity of CecA1 promoter. Furthermore, binding of Relish to κB motif was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. These findings indicate the regulatory mechanism of CecA1 expression in IMD pathway and suggest an approach of engineering antimicrobial peptide promoter with enhanced activities that may lead to broad applications. © 2015 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
