Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) (Nanoviridae: Babuvirus) is transmitted by aphids of the genus Pentalonia in a circulative manner. The cellular mechanisms by which BBTV translocates from the anterior midgut to the salivary gland epithelial tissues are not understood. Here, we used multiple fluorescent markers to study the distribution and the cellular localization of early and late endosomes, macropinosomes, lysosomes, microtubules, actin filaments, and lipid raft subdomains in the gut and principal salivary glands of Pentalonia nigronervosa. We applied colabeling assays, to colocalize BBTV viral particles with these cellular compartments and structures. Our results suggest that multiple potential cellular processes, including clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis and lipid rafts, may not be involved in BBTV internalization.
